1-8-5: VILLAGE POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT:
The Village is committed to maintaining an environment free from discrimination and harassment. In keeping with this commitment, the Village prohibits
and will not tolerate any form of harassment that violates this Village Policy Against Harassment (sometimes referred to herein as "this Village policy" or
"this policy"). This Village Policy Against Harassment is hereby made applicable to and prohibits harassment by any elected or appointed public officials of
the Village and to any vendor, independent contractor, client, customer or other person(s), provided, however, that the conduct of any public official who is
also an employee of the Village shall be governed by the Village of Barrington Personnel Policy Manual, which, in section 1.6 thereof, provides for a
Village policy against harassment which is applicable to all Village employees.
A. Prohibited Conduct: This policy prohibits harassment or other workplace discrimination based on a person's protected status under State and Federal
law. This includes conduct, whether verbal, physical, or visual, that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual based upon that
person's race, gender, sexual orientation, age, color, religious affiliation, national origin, disability, ancestry, marital status, military status, or other
legally protected status. The Village prohibits and will not tolerate harassing conduct that has the purpose or effect of interfering unreasonably with an
individual's work performance, affecting an individual's tangible job benefits, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
The conduct prohibited by this policy specifically includes, but is not limited to:
1. Epithets, slurs, negative stereotyping, or intimidating acts that are based on a person's protected status;
2. Written or graphic material circulated, available on the Village's computer system, or posted or distributed within the workplace that shows hostility
toward a person or persons because of their protected status.
The Village prohibits any such conduct in the Village workplace, and this policy prohibits harassment based on an individual's protected status, even
if it does not rise to the level of a legal violation.
B. Sexual Harassment: Sexual harassment deserves special mention and means any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any
conduct of a sexual nature when: 1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment
or other business relationship; 2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or business
transactional decisions affecting such individual; or 3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work or
business performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or business environment. For purposes of this definition, the phrase
"working or business environment" is not limited to a physical location an employee is assigned to perform his or her duties and does not require an
employment or business relationship. Sexual harassment also includes any harassing conduct based on gender, regardless of whether the conduct is
sexual in nature. Any unwelcome conduct based on gender is also forbidden by this policy regardless of whether the individual engaged in harassment
and the individual being harassed are of the same or different genders.
This policy forbids harassment based on gender regardless of whether it rises to the level of a legal violation.
The Village considers the following conduct to represent, not exclusively, some of the types of acts that violate this Harassment Policy:
1. Physical assaults of a sexual nature included but not limited to rape or sexual battery;
2. Intentional physical conduct which is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, etc.;
3. Unwanted sexual advances, propositions or other sexual comments including but not limited to sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks,
innuendo, jokes, or comments or verbal abuse of a sexual nature. Also included are preferential treatment and promises of a preferential treatment to
a person for submitting to sexual conduct;
4. Sexual or discriminatory displays, publications, or communications anywhere in the Village work place by persons who are subject to this Village
Policy Against Harassment or others including but not limited to pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, reading materials, or other materials
that are suggestive, demeaning, or pornographic and also, including but not limited to, any display, publications or communications made through the
use of a computer, cell phone, personal digital assistant ("PDA"), or similar electronic device(s).

C. Responsibilities Of Any Affected Persons: Everyone at the Village is expected to assure that the Village workplace is free from prohibited discrimination
or harassment. Any affected person is expected to avoid exhibiting and/or participating in any behavior or conduct that could reasonably be interpreted
as prohibited discrimination or harassment under this policy. Any affected person is expected and encouraged to inform either the Village President, the
Village Manager, Human Resources, an employee's supervisor or department head whenever such affected person has observed, experienced and/or
has been subjected to discrimination, harassment, and/or conduct in the Village workplace that is discriminatory, harassing, unwelcome, offensive,
inappropriate, or in poor taste. Village employees are expected to come forward promptly and report any alleged violations of this policy before the
alleged offending behavior becomes repetitive, severe or pervasive. No public official of the Village who is subject to this chapter shall be exempt from
complying with the requirements of this Village Policy Against Harassment.
D. Complaints Of Harassment: If any person subject to this Village Policy Against Harassment experiences or witnesses any conduct that he or she
believes is inconsistent with and/or in violation of this policy, the Village expects the affected person to promptly notify the Village President, Human
Resources, the Village Manager, an employee's supervisor, or department head. This may be done in writing or orally. Any supervisor or department
head who receives a complaint or observes conduct which may violate this policy, must immediately report the complaint or observation to Human
Resources, or the Village Manager. This policy does not require reporting harassment or discrimination to any individual who is creating and/or
participating in the harassment or discrimination. (Ord. 17-3982, 12-11-2017)
E. Village Response: All reports describing conduct that is inconsistent with and/or in violation of this policy will be investigated promptly. Any person who
believes he or she has been subjected to or has observed discrimination or harassment prohibited by this policy has the right to request that the Village
take appropriate action to terminate any such prohibited activity immediately. The Village may take reasonable interim measures, such as a leave of
absence or a transfer, while the Village's investigation of the alleged incident or conduct takes place. The Village will take further appropriate action
once the report has been thoroughly investigated. That action may be a conclusion that a violation occurred, as explained immediately below. The
Village might also conclude, depending on the circumstances, either that no violation of this policy occurred or that the Village's investigation was not
conclusive, and therefore, it could not be determined whether or not a violation of this policy occurred.
If an investigation reveals that a violation of this Village Policy Against Harassment or other inappropriate conduct has been committed by an elected or
appointed public official who is subject to the provisions of this chapter, then the Corporate Authorities of the Village will take corrective action, up to
and including reprimand, censure, and/or removal from office of such elected or appointed public official, to the extent authorized by Illinois law, as is
appropriate under the circumstances. The Village may discipline an appointed or elected public official or other person who is subject to the provisions
of this chapter for any inappropriate conduct discovered in investigating reports made under this policy, regardless of whether the conduct constitutes a
violation of law or a violation of this or any other Village policy. If the person who engaged in harassment is not an elected or appointed public official of
the Village who is subject to the provisions of this chapter, then the Village will take whatever corrective action is reasonable and appropriate under the
circumstances.
Any affected person is encouraged to use the above complaint procedure(s) to report and resolve his or her respective complaints of harassment or
retaliation. The Village's policy provides for the giving of immediate notice of alleged violations of this policy to an appropriate representative of the
Village as listed above, so that the Village may address and resolve any alleged violations of this policy in an expeditious and timely manner, without
waiting for legal proceedings to be initiated and run their course. However, any affected person may also file a charge of discrimination and/or
harassment in writing with the Illinois Department of Human Rights within three hundred (300) days of the alleged incident of discrimination and/or
harassment, unless it is a continuing offense. The Department of Human Rights can be contacted at:
Illinois Department of Human Rights
100 W. Randolph St., Suite 10-100
Chicago, IL 60601
(312)814-6200
The Illinois Human Rights Commission can be contacted at:
Illinois Human Rights Commission
100 W. Randolph St., Suite 5-100
Chicago, IL 60601
(312)814-6269
F. Policy Against Retaliation: The Village prohibits the adverse treatment of any person, Village employee or former Village employee for reporting one or
more incidents of harassment, for assisting a person, Village employee or former Village employee in filing a report, for cooperating in a harassment
investigation, or for filing an administrative claim with the EEOC or a State governmental agency relative to harassment. All persons who experience or
witness any conduct they believe to be retaliatory should immediately follow the reporting procedures provided for in this chapter.
No Village official, Village employee or any Village agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any Village officer, Village employee, or
other affected person(s) due to a person's:
1. Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy;
2. The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of
this policy; or
3. Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy.
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change
in the terms or conditions of the workplace of employment of any affected person that is taken in retaliation for a person's involvement in protected
activity pursuant to this policy.
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be
protected from retaliation.
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act5 provides whistleblower protection from
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 43/522
retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee
who does any of the following:
1. Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, State agency, or other
State employee that the State employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation;
2. Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or
regulation by any officer, member, State agency or other State employee; or
3. Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act.
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act6, an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative
hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the
information discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for
disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information
discloses a violation of a State or Federal law, rule, or regulation7.
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act8, it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two (2) or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a
person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because
he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human
Rights Act.
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a
retaliation charge which is due within three hundred (300) days (IDHR) or three hundred (300) days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. (Ord. 18-4030,
11-26-2018)
G. Confidentiality: In investigating and in imposing any discipline, the Village will attempt to preserve confidentiality to the extent that the needs of the
situation permit.
H. Training On Policy: The Village will regularly conduct training for Village officers and employees on this Village Policy Against Harassment. All Village
officers and employees shall be required to periodically attend such training. (Ord. 17-3982, 12-11-2017)

1-8-8: OTHER ALLEGED ETHICS COMPLAINTS:
Any ethics complaint which alleges any violation other than one which is a violation of this chapter, shall be considered by the Corporate Authorities of the
Village, and such alleged ethics complaint shall be subject to such further action as the Corporate Authorities of the Village determine to be necessary
and/or appropriate to a particular case, but such alleged ethics complaint may first be referred by the Corporate Authorities of the Village to and
considered and investigated by an Ethics and Oversight Committee, an ad hoc Village Board committee which may be appointed from time to time by the
Village President with the advice and consent of the Board of Trustees, except where the Corporate Authorities of the Village determine that the immediate
referral of any such alleged ethics complaint to another law enforcement agency is necessary or appropriate to the particular circumstances. (Ord. 17-
3982, 12-11-2017)
1-8-9: PENALTIES:

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 44/522
preponderance of the evidence. An information or sworn complaint alleging any violation(s) of this chapter must be filed within one year after the

irrelevant or immaterial testimony, which ruling may be overruled by a majority of at least a quorum of the public body. Time limits, if imposed, shall be
fair, generous and equally administered. The public body shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence; however, irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly
repetitious evidence shall not be admissible. The chair shall rule on all questions related to the admissibility of evidence, which ruling may be overruled
by a majority of at least a quorum of the public body. The chair may also impose reasonable conditions on the hearing process after giving due
consideration to factors present in particular proceedings, including, but not limited to, the following:
1. The complexity of the issue.

make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
c. A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
(1) Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments;

A. Note the date the village received the written request;
B. Compute the day on which the period for response will expire and make a notation of that date on the written request (5 business days; or for requests
for commercial purposes or for requests made by "recurrent requesters" as defined herein, 5 business days for an initial response, with a follow up
response within 21 days after receipt of the request, and a final response within a reasonable period thereafter, considering the size and complexity of

denied;
D. Meet with requesters, if necessary, to inspect records in his or her presence;
E. Create a file for the retention of each original request, a copy of the response, a record of written communications with the requester, and a copy of
other related communications;
F. Assemble and duplicate the requested records, except for records which are exempt, and redact any records which may be partially exempt, and/or
coordinate retrieval of the requested records with the facility storing the records for the village;
G. Keep, and/or request from the designated personnel, and maintain a record of those hours over eight (8) hours which were spent by personnel in
retrieving a requested record; and
H. Notify the requester in writing of the status of production of the requested records, i.e., that such records are ready and available for the requester, that
production of the records is denied in whole or in part and the reasons therefor, and/or the amount of any fees and/or costs associated with the request,
where applicable, prior to copying and/or production of such requested records, and whether such fees and/or costs must be paid by the requester
prior to the village's copying of such records. (Ord. 11-3655, 10-24-2011)
1-17-6: TIME FRAME FOR PRODUCTION OF RECORDS; EXTENSION OF TIME TO PRODUCE RECORDS:
A. Pursuant to the FOIA, the village is generally required to produce the requested records within five (5) business days of receipt of the request, excluding
the day the request was received by the village, except where the request is made for commercial purposes, and except where the request is made by
a "recurrent requester" as provided in this chapter.
B. "Commercial enterprise" as used in the Illinois freedom of information act (FOIA) shall include both profit and not for profit ventures, organizations and
entities. The village may inquire as to whether the records requested are sought to advance a commercial purpose, and if a requester attempts to
procure a public record for a commercial purpose without disclosing that the use is for a commercial purpose, that constitutes a violation of the FOIA5.
The village's response to such commercial requests shall be as follows:
1. Within twenty one (21) business days after receipt of such a commercial request, the village shall respond in writing to the requester, which response
shall include an estimate of time required to fulfill the request; an estimate of the fees to be charged, and other associated costs as provided in
section 1-17-7 of this chapter, and, if applicable, notification that the requester may be required to pay the fees and charges in full before the
requested records are copied; and/or notification that the request is unduly burdensome, extending an opportunity to the requester to reduce the
request to a manageable proportion; or provide the requested records.
2. If the requested records were not provided to the commercial requester within the aforesaid twenty one (21) business day period, unless the records
are exempt from disclosure, the requested records shall be sent to the commercial requester within a reasonable period thereafter, considering the
size and complexity of the request.
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a request is delivered on a day which is not a business day, or after the close of business, the request shall be deemed
made on the first business day subsequent thereto.
D. If, upon review of the request, the FOIA officer, or his or her designee, finds that he or she is not able to compile all of the necessary information
immediately, another time may be arranged within the prescribed time frame for the requester to return to receive a response to the request.
E. The FOIA officer, or his or her designee, may extend the time limit for responding to a request by an additional five (5) business days where:
1. The requested record is in a place other than the office in charge of the record.
2. The request requires an extensive search.
3. The records have not been found in time and additional efforts are necessary to retrieve them.
4. The record requires examination to determine if it should be exempt from viewing.
5. Compliance with the request would cause undue burden or interfere with the operations of the village. (Repeated requests for the same information
by the same person shall be deemed unduly burdensome under this provision.)
F. If it is necessary to extend the time limit for production of records, the requester will be notified in writing by the FOIA officer or his or her designee within
five (5) business days of receipt of the request and such notice will give the reason for the extension. Failure to respond to the request within five (5)
business days is considered a denial of the request. (Ord. 11-3655, 10-24-2011)

1-17-8: EXEMPT AND NONEXEMPT RECORDS:

individual subjects8 (P.A. 96-0558).
4. The document(s) requested relate to personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing by the individual subjects of the information. "Unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy" means the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the
subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that bears on the public
duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal privacy9.
5. The document(s) requested are in the possession of the public body and were created in the course of administrative enforcement proceedings, and
any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement purposes, and that disclosure would do one or more of the following10:

agency that is the recipient of the request;

complaints with or provide information to administrative, investigative, law enforcement, or penal agencies; except that the identities of witnesses
to traffic accidents, traffic accident reports, and rescue reports shall be provided by agencies of local government except when disclosure would
interfere with an active criminal investigation conducted by the agency that is the recipient of the request;
e. Disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional
agencies related to detection, observation or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in demonstrable harm to

8. The document(s) requested would disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person or business where the
trade secrets or commercial or financial information are furnished under a claim that they are proprietary, privileged or confidential, and that

applies to the records requested, including all trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by a public body, including a public
pension fund, from a private equity fund or a privately held company within the investment portfolio of a private equity fund as a result of either
investing or evaluating a potential investment of public funds in a private equity fund. This exemption does not apply to the aggregate financial
performance information of a private equity fund, nor to the identity of the fund's managers or general partners. This exemption does not apply to the
identity of a privately held company within the investment portfolio of a private equity fund, unless the disclosure of the identity of a privately held

disclosure13.
9. The document(s) requested constitute proposals or bids for a contract, grant or agreement, including information which if it were disclosed would
frustrate procurement or give an advantage to any person proposing to enter into a contract or agreement with the body, until an award or final
selection is made. Information prepared by or for the body in preparation of a bid solicitation is exempt until an award or final selection is made14.
10. The document(s) requested are valuable formulas, computer geographic systems, designs, drawings or research data obtained or produced by any
public body when disclosure could reasonably be expected to produce private gain or public loss. The exemption for "computer geographic systems"

would jeopardize the security of the system or its data or the security of materials under this exemption20.

representatives, but any final contract or agreement is subject to inspection and copying21.

discovery rules adopted by the Illinois supreme court. The records, documents and information relating to a real estate sale are exempt until a sale is

prevent, or respond to potential attacks upon a community's population or systems, facilities, or installations, the destruction or contamination of

electricity, and certifies to that person that the sale is either entirely or partially nontaxable as a sale for resale.

article directly to the village pursuant to subsection 3-2D-8B of this article on the amount of electricity that that reseller uses or consumes, and shall

3-2F-14: STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS:
The village, through the local tax administrator, shall review all tax returns in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any amounts due and
owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or provide any tax still
due and owing.

For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local
tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior to the
filing of the application but not more than four (4) years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application
may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly
determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless
the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax
and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid
within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator, whichever is longer. (Ord. 07-3415, 11-5-2007)

The local tax administrator shall establish an internal review procedure regarding any liens filed against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon a
determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the
local tax administrator shall:
A. Timely remove the lien at the village's expense;
B. Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
C. Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien. (Ord. 07-3415, 11-5-2007)
3-2F-18: APPLICATION:

designee: a) the sale and serving of alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises; b) catered events on the premises which include the serving of

charitable, athletic, religious, youth service, or any civic or community service programs located within and/or serving the village for an event where
alcoholic liquor is to be sold; or where the serving of such alcoholic liquor at such event requires or may require a special event license from the state
of Illinois liquor control commission (the organizations described above are for convenience sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as
"qualifying organizations"). Such a qualifying organization shall also obtain such a special event license from the state of Illinois liquor control
commission where so required. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such special temporary license shall be required to be obtained from the
village if alcoholic liquor is being served on behalf of the qualifying organization by the BASSET trained employees of a caterer holding a current and
valid catering liquor license, which caterer has been hired by such qualifying organization for such event.

3-3-1 of this chapter. Each application by a not for profit corporation shall contain a copy of the applicant's recorded articles of incorporation and a
copy of the applicant's most recent annual report filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Illinois. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
application submitted by a qualifying organization shall include reasonable evidence of the purpose and function that such qualifying organization is
providing. All applications shall state the time period for which the license shall be applicable and shall state whether the license is for solely an
outdoor or an indoor location.

by BASSET trained officers, members, volunteers, employees, and/or agents of the specified qualifying organization, for consumption on the
premises or within the area and for the days and hours of sale, all as specifically designated in such special license. A Class 7 license is exempt from
the separation requirements provided for in subsection 3-3-13B of this chapter. The fee for such special license shall be as specified from time to
time in section 1-14-1 of this Code, but no separate application fee shall be charged. A qualifying organization shall be required to obtain such a
Class 7 license for each and every such event it holds within the Village, and the number of events held by any such qualifying organization shall not
exceed five (5) such events in any calendar year, unless specifically authorized by the Board of Trustees. No such special license shall be issued to
any applicant other than the Village until the Village President, or his or her designee, has received evidence that such applicant shall have
satisfactory dramshop liability insurance coverage in effect during the period for which each such special license shall be issued. (Ord. 16-3908, 11-

3-3-11: LICENSE TRANSFER; CHANGE OF STATUS:
A license hereunder shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed one year after issuance, unless sooner revoked as provided in this chapter
or pursuant to state law provided, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable
or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated. Such license shall cease if any material information contained
in the application on file for the current license relative to the identity or qualification of the applicant is in any respect no longer accurate, or if the licensee
is no longer a person or entity entitled to a license as specified in section 3-3-3 of this chapter. Each licensee shall have a continuing obligation to disclose
any change or anticipated change in the information contained in the application for his current license by the filing from time to time of an amended
application or applications as necessary for this purpose. Such license shall also cease upon the death of the licensee and shall not descend by the laws
of testate or intestate devolution; provided, that executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or
bankrupt licensee, which such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor, may continue the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor under the

insolvency or bankruptcy, until the expiration of such license but not longer than six (6) months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such license. A

3-3-12: RENEWAL OF LICENSE:
A. Any licensee may renew a liquor license currently held by said licensee at the expiration thereof; provided that said licensee has previously applied to
the village for renewal thereof pursuant to subsection B of this section and that said licensee is then qualified to be reissued such a license, and the
premises for which such renewed license is sought are suitable for the purpose of said license and meet any requirements for such license pursuant to
the provisions of this code; provided, further, that the renewal of any liquor license is a privilege herein provided for and is not and shall not be
construed as a vested right of any licensee and shall not prohibit the village board from decreasing the number of liquor licenses which may be issued
by the village.
B. Each licensee seeking renewal of a liquor license shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to the time of each such renewal (i.e., on or before April 1
preceding a new license year), submit to the village an application for renewal thereof as provided for in this chapter, except such licensee shall not be
required to be refingerprinted. At the discretion of the village president, a short form of renewal application may be utilized for this purpose. In the event

belonging to the opposite sex, or not properly or decently garbed. (1973 Code § 15-68)
5-2-8-2: OBSCENITY:
A. Elements Of The Offense: A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise
reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he or she:
1. Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of
the obscene; or
2. Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
3. Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available anything obscene; or
4. Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an obscene exhibition of his or her body for gain; or
5. Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene matter or material with intent to disseminate it in violation of this section, or of the penal laws or
regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
6. Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of material represented or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
B. Obscene Defined: Any material or performance is "obscene" if:
1. The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and
2. The average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate
sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition
of the genitals; and
3. Taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
C. Interpretation Of Evidence: Obscenity shall be judged with references to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judgedwith reference to children or other
specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or
directed to such an audience.
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for
the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is
lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
In any prosecution for an offense under this section, evidence shall be admissible to show:
1. The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed;
2. What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on
the behavior of such people;
3. The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;
4. The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state;
5. Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material;
6. Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator.
D. Permissive Inference: The trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved
plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three (3) copies of obscene
material.
E. Affirmative Defenses: It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:
1. Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under eighteen (18) years of age;
2. Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material. (Ord. 13-3757, 10-14-2013)

public street or municipal parking lot) at any time may, by or under the direction of an officer or member of the police department, be immobilized in
such a manner as to prevent its operation if the state registration number of the vehicle is included on the police department's current immobilization
list. A vehicle's state registration number shall be included on the police department's current immobilization list if:
a. The registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated five (5) or more parking violation complaints on one or more vehicles registered in his or her
name or five (5) or more administrative notices of violation(s) on one or more vehicles registered in his or her name, relative to which the

vehicle immobilization by appearing in person at a preimmobilization hearing and submitting evidence to the village administrative hearing officer
or his designee which would conclusively disprove liability, such as, but not limited to, the following:
(1) The person was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle on the date or dates the notices of parking violations were issued;
(2) The fines or penalties for the violations cited in the report were paid; or
(3) The registered owner of the vehicle has not accumulated five (5) or more parking violation complaints on one or more vehicles registered in his

notice also shall provide information specifying how release of the immobilizing restraint may be had, and how the registered owner may obtain a
postimmobilization hearing pursuant to this subsection C.

b. Taking any one of the following actions:
(1) By paying all fines, penalties, and costs, if any, on the outstanding complaints specified in the preimmobilization notice sent pursuant to
subsection C1b of this section;

5. Notice Of Impoundment: Within fifteen (15) days after a previously immobilized vehicle has been impounded, notice of impoundment shall be sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered owner of the vehicle at the address to which the preimmobilization notice specified in
subsection C1b of this section was mailed. The notice shall state that the owner has the right to a postimmobilization hearing as provided in

disposed of as provided for in this title relative to abandoned vehicles.

subsequent towing was erroneous and/or whether the vehicle was properly included on an immobilization list, if the owner files a written demand
for a hearing with the village administrative adjudication hearing officer or his designee within twenty one (21) days after issuance of the notice of

b. A postimmobilization hearing shall be conducted before the village administrative adjudication hearing officer within seventy two (72) hours of
receipt of a written demand for hearing unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
c. The failure of an owner to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such a hearing.
d. A postimmobilization hearing provided by this subsection C6 shall not determine the validity of or otherwise adjudicate any citation or notice of
parking violation issued relative to the immobilized vehicle.

assessed for any immobilization, tow, or storage where the immobilization has been determined to be erroneous pursuant to a hearing. Prior to a
postimmobilization hearing as provided in subsection C6 of this section, the owner may deposit with the village the amounts required by this
subsection C7, together with any storage fees to date, to secure the release of the vehicle if all other requirements for release of the vehicle have

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 276/522
1. Placement of the tow operator on the tow rotation list was secured by fraud or concealment of a material fact, which if known would have caused
disapproval of the tow operator's application;
2. The tow operator has violated any of the provisions of this chapter;
3. The service provided by the tow operator is or has been substantially inadequate, which shall include, but not be limited to, failing to be available for
or not accepting calls, slow response time, excessive damage claims, repeated complaints from citizens, or inadequate towing equipment;
4. "Failing to be available or not accepting calls" as mentioned in subsection A3 of this section will be defined to mean five (5) occasions within a thirty
(30) day period.
B. Temporary Removal: A tow operator may temporarily be removed from the tow rotation list for not more than thirty (30) days at any one time. A tow
operator shall be given an opportunity to cure any default or violation of this chapter within thirty (30) days of removal from the tow rotation list and shall
be reinstated on the tow rotation list upon its presenting sufficient evidence to the chief of police that it has cured any such default or violation.
C. Pending Suspension/Removal: If the chief of police determines the alleged offense does not constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety or
welfare of the public, the police chief shall provide the tow operator with written notice at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the
temporary or permanent removal by delivering said notice to the tow operator's place of business. Said written notice shall include: 1) the effective date
of the removal; 2) whether the removal is temporary or permanent; 3) the allegations which form the basis of the removal; 4) the actions, if any, the tow
operator may take to prevent the removal from occurring; and 5) the procedure which the tow operator must follow to request a hearing to appeal the

sides with the opportunity to present all evidence relevant to the removal. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision based upon a
preponderance of the presented evidence within seven (7) days of the hearing. The opinion will be sent to the tow operator's business address with a
copy retained in the tow operator's' application file at the police department. The village or the tow operator may contest the decision of the hearing
officer in any manner provided by law.
D. Immediate Suspension/Removal: If the chief of police determines that a tow operator presents an immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the
community, or if the tow operator has not provided proof of valid insurance in the types and amounts required by this chapter, the chief of police may
remove the tow operator from the tow rotation list prior to any hearing. If the chief of police finds just cause, he shall provide written notification to the
tow operator that the tow operator is being removed from the tow rotation list immediately. Said written notice shall be delivered to the tow operator's
place of business on the first day the removal is effective, and shall state: 1) that the removal is effective immediately; 2) whether the removal is
temporary or permanent; 3) the allegations forming the basis of the removal; and 4) the procedure which the tow operator must follow to request a
hearing to appeal the removal. If a hearing is requested, the village manager, or the village manager's designee, shall act as the hearing officer. The
hearing(s) shall be informal and provide both sides with the opportunity to present all evidence relevant to the removal. The hearing officer shall issue a
written decision based upon a preponderance of the presented evidence within seven (7) days of the hearing. The opinion shall be sent to the tow
operator's business address, with a copy retained in the tow operator's application file at the police department. If the decision favors the tow operator,
the hearing officer shall notify the police department so that the tow operator's towing privileges may be reinstated as soon as possible. The village or

E. Method Of Requesting Hearing: A tow operator must request a hearing by: 1) telephoning and speaking directly with the village manager within ten (10)
days of receiving a notice of removal; and 2) scheduling a hearing. Leaving a message for the village manager will not satisfy this requirement. The
village manager's office shall, within three (3) business days of the request, set a date and time for the hearing, and further, the hearing shall be held
within ten (10) business days from the date of the request for the hearing. If the tow operator is unavailable at the time scheduled by the village, the
village shall not be bound by the time period as stated above, and the removal will not be stayed. If the village is unable to schedule a hearing within
the applicable time as stated above, all action on removal of the tow operator shall be stayed until the hearing. (Ord. 15-3873, 12-14-2015)

officer, must record the name and address of the person and make such information available to the police department upon request.
This section is intended only to prohibit the soliciting of business at the scene of accidents and emergencies, and shall not be construed to prohibit any tow

or emergencies. (Ord. 15-3873, 12-14-2015)

removal.

by the police officer in charge at the scene.
D. When a tow operator tows a vehicle pursuant to a DUI arrest, as authorized by 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/4-203(e), the tow operator shall hold
that vehicle in storage for twelve (12) hours or less as stated in 625 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/4-203(e) and may only then release the vehicle to the

is not available. The tow operator will be marked unavailable. The police dispatcher will then call the next tow operator on the list.

tow rotation list, nor shall any tow operator knowingly permit such a person to operate a tow truck on the tow rotation list calls; provided, however, that a

The following procedures shall be followed when initiating the towing of a vehicle:
A. Whenever a police officer initiates a tow of a vehicle, the officer shall contact the Barrington police department and inform the watch commander of the
department then on duty that a tow has been authorized. The Barrington police department shall then select a towing service from the Barrington police
department's tow rotation list and shall contact that towing service directly by phone, computer, dispatch, or similar means. Towing services shall be
contacted in the order listed on the appropriate tow rotation list, at which point the towing service shall be placed at the end of that tow rotation list. In
the event a listed towing service is not available, the next listed towing service on that tow rotation list shall be contacted.
B. The Barrington police department may deviate from the order listed on a tow rotation list if the towing service next on that tow rotation list is, in the
judgment of the authorizing officer or the watch commander of the department then on duty making the selection, incapable of or not properly equipped
for handling a specific task related to the tow that requires special skills or equipment. A deviation from the order listed on the tow rotation list for this
reason shall not cause a loss of rotation turn by the towing service determined to be incapable or not properly equipped for handling the request.
C. In the event of an emergency, an officer or the watch commander of the department then on duty, taking into account the safety and location of the
situation, may deviate from the order of the tow rotation list and obtain towing service from any source deemed appropriate.
D. If the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle is present at the scene of the disabled vehicle, is not under arrest, and does not abandon his or her
vehicle, and in the officer's opinion the disabled vehicle is not impeding or obstructing traffic, illegally parked, or posing a security or safety risk, the
officer shall allow the owner of the vehicle to specify a towing service to relocate the disabled vehicle. If the owner chooses not to specify a towing
service, the officer or the watch commander of the department then on duty shall select a towing service for the vehicle as provided in subsection A of
this section.
E. If a tow operator is present or arrives where a tow is needed and it has not been requested by the officer or the watch commander of the department
then on duty, or the owner or operator, the officer, unless acting under one of the exceptions set forth in section 11-1431 of the Illinois motor vehicle

B. Insurance:
1. Before the issuance of any permit pursuant to this chapter, with the exception of a permit for a residential neighborhood block party, the village
manager or the corporate authorities shall require the proposed permittee to furnish evidence of public liability coverage insurance in the amount of
two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) naming the village, its officers, employees, agents, and volunteers, as additional insureds in such form as may be
determined by the village manager to provide for the payment of any claims for personal injuries (including death and any injuries to village
employees, agents, or contractors), property damage or other suits arising out of or connected with such parades, public assemblies, special events,
or other similar activities.
2. Each insurance policy required hereunder shall include a provision to the effect that it shall not be subject to cancellation, reduction in any coverage,
or to other material changes until notice thereof has been received by the village manager not less than thirty (30) days prior to such cancellation or
change and the village manager has approved in writing such cancellation and/or change. The village manager shall be authorized to approve or

organization is and shall be required to maintain the insurance required hereunder in full force and effect for the duration of the permit period. Failure
of the permittee, event manager, and/or sponsoring organization to maintain such insurance during such period shall result in automatic revocation of
the permit. For the purposes of this chapter, the permit shall be effective during the event and include the time required before and after the event for
construction, assembly, dismantling, and removal of all materials, equipment and/or support structures, as well as the time following the event during
which the public property shall be cleared and restored to the condition which existed prior to commencement of such event.

permittee shall execute a hold harmless agreement with the village to indemnify and hold harmless the village, together with its officers, agents,
volunteers, and employees from all losses, damages, injuries, claims, demands and expenses arising out of, or as the result of, the operation of the
event, the special village services provided for the event, and/or the permit issued for same, and/or the condition, maintenance and use of the public
property in connection with the event, as well as for any injury to or sustained by a village employee, agent, or contractor in conjunction with the event
authorized by the village permit issued pursuant to this chapter.

village to contract for additional special village services in conjunction with the parade, public assembly, or special event. Such estimated costs shall be
specifically set out in writing to the applicant prior to the issuance of the permit, showing the basis of the estimated costs, to the extent it is possible to
do so. These estimated costs shall not include any use of village personnel to protect the public safety in any emergency situation in conjunction with
the event. In the event that the estimated costs are paid in excess of the actual costs, the overage shall be refunded to the applicant within thirty (30)
days after such a determination has been made. Conversely, if the actual costs exceed the estimated costs that have already been paid, the permittee,
the event manager, and the sponsoring organization shall be jointly and severally responsible to pay to the village any unpaid balance of the actual
costs within thirty (30) days after being invoiced for same by the village. In addition, the permittee, the event manager, and the sponsoring organization

by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
D. Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or
similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the Village rights-of-way. Utilities that
are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the Village enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the Village
may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
E. Effect Of Franchises, Licenses, Or Similar Agreements:
1. Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or
similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any
lawful renewal or extension thereof.
2. Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions of any
franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar

subcontractors shall comply with this section.
B. Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess
or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary

subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village
evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection A of this
section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the workers' compensation act.

resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 07-

1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee
is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to
perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to
the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;

good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the enforcement official, and may also include reasonable,
directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion
of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the enforcement official may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights
under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount
within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon
written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection C of this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the
security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.

by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights
which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 07-3415, 11-5-2007)

structure, including pre-existing equipment, associated with the facility is, in the aggregate, no more than twenty eight (28) cubic feet in volume.
B. Permit Required: An applicant is required to obtain one or more permits to collocate a small wireless facility. An application is received and processed,
and permits are issued subject to the following requirements:
1. Public Safety Use Space Reservation: The Village does hereby reserve space on all Village utility poles and Village wireless support structures for
future public safety uses, and funds shall be and are hereby tentatively appropriated or budgeted for such purposes, but a reservation of space will
not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the Village reasonably determines that the Village utility pole or Village wireless support
structure cannot accommodate both uses.
2. Application Requirements: A wireless services provider shall be required to provide the following information to the enforcement official when
seeking a permit to collocate small wireless facilities on or adjacent to a Village utility pole or on or adjacent to a Village wireless support structure, or
any public right-of-way within the Village:

g. In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the Village, the wireless
provider shall provide to the enforcement official legally competent evidence of the consent of the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation.
3. Height Limitations: The maximum height of a small wireless facility within the Village shall be limited as follows:
a. Each small wireless facility shall be mounted on structures fifty feet (50') or less in height, including their antennas;
b. Each small wireless facility shall be mounted on structures no more than ten percent (10%) taller than other adjacent structures; or
c. Each small wireless facility shall not extend existing structures on which they are located to a height of more than fifty feet (50') or by more than
ten percent (10%), whichever is greater.
4. Other Requirements:
a. A wireless services provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for
public safety communications as determined by the enforcement official.
Wireless services providers shall not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment.
Unacceptable interference shall be determined by the enforcement official and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's
regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency.
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless services provider has been given written notice of the interference by the
public safety agency, or by the enforcement official, the wireless services provider, at its own expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary,
as determined by the enforcement official, to correct and eliminate the interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless
facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent testing, if necessary.
The enforcement official may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility if such small wireless facility causes interference and if the wireless
services provider is not making a good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for
interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47
CFR 90.675, and/or other applicable FCC standards, or if after such good faith efforts, the enforcement official concludes that such interference
cannot be resolved. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance.
b. Each wireless services provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the Village and a private property owner
that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
c. Each wireless services provider shall comply with all applicable spacing requirements in this Code concerning the location of ground-mounted
equipment located in the Village rights-of-way, if any.
d. Each wireless services provider shall comply with the provisions of this Code concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation
of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval, but an applicant may apply to the enforcement official for
one or more exceptions to such undergrounding requirements, and, in any event, the installation of replacement poles is not prohibited.
e. A wireless services provider shall comply with this section and such other applicable provisions of this Code adopted by the Village from time to
time for construction and public safety in the rights-of-way, including, but not limited to, wiring and cabling requirements, grounding requirements,
utility pole extension requirements, and signage limitations, and the requirements of this chapter regulating the location, size, and height of small
wireless facilities, related to the abandonment and removal of small wireless facilities.
f. A wireless services provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on or adjacent to Village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution
or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility pole
and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless services provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of
the pole.
For purposes of this subsection B4f, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the
meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
g. Each wireless services provider shall comply with all generally applicable provisions of this Code, including but not limited to those that relate to
public safety, except to the extent expressly preempted in this chapter.
h. Each wireless services provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable
stealth, concealment, and aesthetic requirements which may be adopted by the Corporate Authorities of this Village from time to time as an
appendix to this section, chapter, and title, which may include restrictions relative to design and/or concealment measures in a Historic District or
historic landmark, but such design and/or concealment measures shall not have the effect of prohibiting any of a wireless services provider's
technology and shall not be considered part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the determining height and/or volume restrictions on a
small wireless facility.
The Corporate Authorities of the Village, after receiving a specific recommendation from the enforcement official, may by ordinance grant an
exception and/or waiver from the requirements of this section and/or of this chapter, which shall be based upon good cause shown by an applicant
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 322/522
which shall include unique circumstances or undue hardship in the application of this section and/or of this chapter in a specific case or cases, and
subject to the other provisions of this Code, and subject to the other applicable ordinances of the Village. Such waiver(s) and/or exception(s) are
not prohibited by this chapter.
i. To be considered a small wireless facility, such facility shall not require antenna structure registration under 47 USC part 17.
j. A small wireless facility shall not result in human exposure to radio frequency radiation in excess of the applicable safety standards specified in
section 47 USC 1.1307(b).
5. Completeness Of Application: Within ten (10) days after receiving an application, the enforcement official will determine whether the application is
complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the enforcement official will provide a notice of deficiency to the applicant
specifically identifying the missing information. An application will be deemed complete if the Village fails to provide notification to the applicant within
ten (10) days after when all documents, information, and fees specifically enumerated in the Village's permit application form are submitted by the
applicant to the Village.
Processing deadlines will be tolled from the time the Village sends the notice of deficiency until the time the applicant provides the missing
information.
6. Application Process: The Village shall process applications as follows:
a. An application to collocate a small wireless facility on or adjacent to an existing utility pole or on or adjacent to a wireless support structure will be
processed on a nondiscriminatory basis. The first fully-completed application received by the enforcement official shall have priority over
incomplete applications received from other applicants for collocation on the same utility pole or wireless support structure. Such a fully-completed
application will be deemed approved if the enforcement official fails to approve or deny the application within ninety (90) days of the enforcement
official's receipt of such application.
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the enforcement
official in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than seventy five (75) days after the submission to the
enforcement official of a fully-completed application.
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day after submission to the enforcement official of the complete application or the
10th day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the enforcement official. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude
the enforcement official's denial of the permit request within the specific approval time limits as provided above in this section.
b. An application to collocate a small wireless facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole will be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis
and deemed approved only if the enforcement official fails to approve or deny the application within one hundred twenty (120) days.
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the enforcement
official in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than one hundred five (105) days after the submission of a
completed application.
The permit will be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of
the deemed approved notice by the enforcement official. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude such enforcement official's
denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this section.
c. The enforcement official will approve an application unless the application does not meet the requirements of this section.
If the enforcement official determines that applicable provisions of this Code which relate to the public safety, or the provisions of this section
require that a utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval may be conditioned upon the
replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of the applicant.
The enforcement official will document the basis for a denial, including the specific provisions of this Code or application conditions on which the
denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the enforcement official denies an application.
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the enforcement official and resubmit the revised application to the enforcement official once
within thirty (30) days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The enforcement official will
approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved.
However, the applicant shall notify the enforcement official in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved
basis, which may be submitted with the resubmitted application.
Any subsequent review will be limited to the deficiencies cited by the enforcement official in the denial. However, this revised application cure does
not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless
equipment associated with the small wireless facility.
7. Tolling: The "deemed approved" time period for applications may be further tolled by:
a. The express agreement in writing by both the applicant and the enforcement official; or
b. A local, State or Federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes a delay in approval by the Village.
8. Consolidated Applications: An applicant seeking to collocate two (2) or more small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the Village may file with
the Village a consolidated application for the proposed facilities, and upon review and approval of said application by the enforcement official, the
Village will issue a single permit therefor upon the applicant's payment to the Village of all required fee(s) therefor as specified from time to time in
section 1-14-1 of this Code.
If an application for collocation of multiple small wireless facilities is denied in part by the enforcement official and/or the application is determined to
be incomplete in any way, the enforcement official may remove from the application any small wireless facility collocations which are denied and/or
for which incomplete information has been provided and treat separately any remaining requests for small wireless facility collocations. In such
event, the enforcement official may require separate applications and separate application fees for each collocation that is reviewed and/or approved
separately from a consolidated application.

set forth below:
(1) For an initial application to deploy small wireless facilities, if the enforcement official notifies the applicant on or before the 10th day after
submission that the application is materially incomplete, and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information (a "notice of
deficiency") and the specific rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or information, the shot clock date calculation
shall restart at zero (0) on the date on which the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the Village in the notice of
deficiency to render the application complete.
(2) For all other initial applications, the tolling period shall be the number of days from:
(A) The day after the date when the enforcement official notifies the applicant in writing that the application is materially incomplete and clearly
and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that the applicant must submit to render the application complete and the
specific rule or regulation creating this obligation (a "notice of deficiency"), until
(B) The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the enforcement official in the notice of deficiency to
render the application complete,
(C) But only if the notice of deficiency pursuant to subsection B9d(2)(A) of this section is effectuated on or before the 30th day after the date
when the application was submitted.
(3) For resubmitted applications following a notice of deficiency, the tolling period shall be the number of days from:
(A) The day after the date when the enforcement official notifies the applicant in writing that the applicant's supplemental submission was not
sufficient to render the application complete and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information that need to be
submitted based on the enforcement official's initial notice of deficiency (i.e., original request under subsection B9d(1) or B9d(2) of this section),
until
(B) The date when the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the enforcement official in the initial notice of deficiency
to render the application complete,
(C) But only if the notice of deficiency pursuant to subsection B9d(3)(A) of this section is effectuated on or before the 10th day after the date
when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the enforcement official's initial notice of deficiency (i.e., the enforcement
official's request under subsection B9d(1) or B9d(2) of this section).
e. Shot Clock Date: The shot clock date for an application is determined by counting forward, beginning on the day after the date when the
application was submitted, by the number of calendar days of the shot clock period identified pursuant to subsection B9b of this section and
including any pre-application period identified by the enforcement official, provided that if the date calculated in this manner is a Saturday or a
Sunday, or a legal holiday, the shot clock date is the next business day after such date.
The enforcement official will use a reasonable effort to approve or deny an application within the shot clock period.

A. Request For Variance: A utility requesting a variance from one or more of the provisions of this chapter must do so in writing to the enforcement official
as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this chapter from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a
variance should be granted.
B. Authority To Grant Variances: The enforcement official shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the
variance request on an individual basis.
C. Conditions For Granting Of Variance: The enforcement official may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that
would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions For Granting Of A Variance: As a condition for authorizing a variance, the enforcement official may require the utility requesting
the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this chapter but which carry out the
purposes of this chapter.
E. Right To Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the enforcement
official under the provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the Village Board, or such other board or commission as it may designate.
The application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination. The Village Board shall commence its consideration of the appeal at the Board's next regularly scheduled meeting occurring at least
seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The Village Board shall timely decide the appeal. (Ord. 07-3415, 11-5-2007; amd. Ord. 17-3938, 4-10-

utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the
requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or
removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost
apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it. (Ord. 07-3415, 11-5-2007; amd.

8-4-9: RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE:
A. Franchise Renewal Generally: Franchise renewal shall be prescribed by applicable law. The village and any grantee by mutual consent may enter into
informal renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. Pursuant to 47 USC section 546, the following procedure shall apply:
1. The village may, on its own initiative, during the six (6) month period which begins with the thirty sixth month before the franchise expiration,
commence a proceeding which affords the public in the village appropriate notice and participation for the purpose of: a) identifying the future cable
related community needs and interests; and b) reviewing the performance of the grantee under the franchise. If the grantee submits, during such six
(6) month period, a written renewal notice requesting the commencement of such proceeding, the village shall commence such proceeding not later
than six (6) months after the date such notice is submitted.
2. Upon completion of the proceeding under subsection A1 of this section, the grantee may, on its own initiative or at the request of the village, submit a
proposal for renewal. The village may establish a date by which such proposal shall be submitted.
3. Upon submittal by the grantee of a proposal to the village for the renewal of the franchise, the village shall provide prompt, public notice of such
proposal and renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed and, at the request of the grantee or
on its own initiative, commence an administrative proceeding after providing prompt, public notice of such proceeding.
4. The village shall consider in any administrative proceeding whether: a) the grantee has substantially complied with material terms of the existing
franchise and with applicable law; b) the quality of the grantee's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints and billing
practices, but without regard to the mix or quality of cable services or other services provided over the system, has been reasonable in the light of
community needs; c) the grantee has the financial, legal and technical ability to provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in the
grantee's proposal; and d) the grantee's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable related community needs and interests, taking into account
the costs of meeting such needs and interests.
5. In any proceeding under subsection A4 of this section, the grantee shall be afforded adequate notice, and the grantee and the village, or its
designee, shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised
in the proceedings under subsection A1 of this section), to require the production of evidence and to question witnesses. A transcript shall be made
of any such proceeding.
6. At the completion of a proceeding under subsection A4 of this section, the village shall issue a written decision granting or denying the proposal for
renewal based upon the record of such proceeding and transmit a copy of such decision to the grantee. Such decision shall state the reasons
therefor.
7. Any denial of a proposal for renewal that has been submitted in compliance with the procedures set forth above shall be based on one or more
adverse findings made with respect to the factors described at subsections A4a through A4d of this section pursuant to the record of the proceeding
under said subsections. The village may not base a denial of renewal on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the franchise or
on events considered under subsection A4b of this section unless the village has provided the grantee with notice and the opportunity to cure or in
any case in which it is documented that the village has waived its right to object.
8. The grantee may appeal any final decision or failure of the village to act in accordance with the procedural requirements of this subsection. The court
shall grant appropriate relief if the court finds that: a) any action of the village is not in compliance with the procedural requirements of this
subsection; or b) in the event of a final decision of the village denying the renewal proposal, the grantee has demonstrated that the adverse finding of
the village with respect to each of the factors described in subsections A4a through A4d of this section on which the denial is based is not supported
by a preponderance of the evidence, based on the record of the administrative proceeding.
B. Franchise Renewal In Event Of Change In Federal Law: In the event that any or all of the above referenced provisions of federal law are repealed, the
village and any grantee shall agree to continue to follow the procedures set forth in subsection A of this section, to the extent permitted by law. (Ord.

1. Within fifteen (15) days after the award of the franchise, the grantee shall deposit with the village an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial
institution in the amount of twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), with the form to be established by the village. The form and content of such
letter of credit shall be approved by the village attorney. These instruments shall be used to ensure the faithful performance by the grantee of all
provisions of this chapter, and to ensure compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency, commission, board, department, division,
or office of the village having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under this chapter, and to ensure the payment by the grantee of any claims, liens,
and taxes due the village which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system.
2. The letter of credit shall be maintained at the amount established above or as otherwise specified in a franchise agreement. The grantee shall
replenish the security fund within fourteen (14) days after written notice from the village that monies have been withdrawn from the fund, or if there is
otherwise a deficiency in the amount of the fund.
3. If the grantee fails to pay to the village any compensation within the time fixed in the franchise agreement; or fails after thirty (30) days' notice to pay
to the village any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the village within thirty (30) days, any damages, costs or expenses which the village is
compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with the franchise; or fails, after three (3) days' notice of such failure by
the village, to comply with any provision of the franchise which the village reasonably determines can be remedied by demand on the letter of credit,
the village may immediately demand payment of the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the letter of credit. Upon such demand for
payment, the village shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof.
4. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by the franchise

surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until thirty (30) days after receipt by the village, by registered mail, of a written notice of
such intention to cancel or not to renew."
6. Receipt of the thirty (30) day notice shall be construed as a default granting the village the right to demand payment from the bank for the letter of
credit.
7. The village, at any time during the term of the franchise, may waive in writing grantee's requirement to maintain a letter of credit or may lessen the
amount. The waiver of the requirement can be initiated by the village or grantee.

increases in the Chicago metropolitan area consumer price index during the annual period.
B. Construction Bond:
1. Within thirty (30) days after the award of the franchise (excluding renewed franchises), the grantee shall file with the village a performance bond in
the amount of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the costs to install the system contained in the application in favor of the village. This bond shall be
maintained throughout the construction period and until such time as determined by the village, unless specified in the franchise agreement.
2. If the grantee fails to comply with any law, ordinance or resolution governing the franchise, or fails to fulfill and perform each term and condition of
the franchise as it relates to the conditions relative to the construction of the system, including the franchise agreement that is incorporated herein by
reference, there shall be recoverable jointly and severally, from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by the village as a
result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the grantee, plus a
reasonable allowance for attorney fees, including the village legal staff, and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. This subsection shall be an
additional remedy for any and all violations outlined in subsection A of this section.
3. When the grantee has completed construction of the service area, the village shall waive the requirement of the grantee to maintain the bond.
However, the village may require a construction bond to be posted by the grantee for any construction subsequent to the completion of the initial
service areas where the estimated cost of the project exceeds forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00), including, but not limited to, any construction
which occurs during any renewed franchise term.
4. The bond shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled by the surety, nor the
intention not to renew be stated by the surety, until thirty (30) days after receipt by the village, by registered mail, of a written notice of such intent to

another bond is provided.

requirement can be initiated by the village or the grantee.

village as an additional insured, and shall be filed and maintained with the village during the term of the franchise.
3. Neither the provisions of this subsection nor any damages recovered by the village hereunder shall be construed to limit the liability of the grantee
under any franchise issued hereunder or for damages.
4. All insurance policies maintained pursuant to the franchise shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby understood and agreed that this
insurance policy may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the surety until thirty (30) days after receipt by the
village, by registered mail, a written notice of such intention to cancel or not to renew. This insurance shall be primary to any insurance obtained by
the village on its own behalf, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein."

public convenience would be enhanced thereby.
2. Where poles or other freestanding wire holding structures for aerial plants already existing for use in serving the village are available for use by the

D. When there have been similar complaints made or where there exists recurring evidence which casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service,
the village shall have the right and authority to require the grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system. The grantee shall fully
cooperate with the village in performing such testing and shall prepare results and a report, if requested, within thirty (30) days after notice. Such report
shall include the following information:
1. The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the special tests.
2. The system component(s) tested.
3. The equipment used and procedures employed in testing.
4. The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved.
5. Any other information pertinent to the tests and analyses which may be required.

F. The village's rights under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analyses and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on
recurring complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the village has reasonable grounds in its judgment to believe that the
complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against violations of this chapter and an attendant franchise
agreement. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-24: GRANTEE RULES AND REGULATIONS:
The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure uninterrupted service to
each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or
applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-25: TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL:
A. A franchise shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the village. The grantee may, however,
transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee, and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the
grantee without such consent; provided, that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. Any proposed assignee must possess
the necessary legal, technical and financial qualifications to establish its ability to operate the system in conformity with federal law and this chapter,
proof of which shall be provided by the grantee and/or assignee to the reasonable satisfaction of the village. Any proposed assignee must agree to
comply with all provisions of the franchise. The village shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of a sale or
transfer submitted in writing that contains or is accompanied by all such information as is required. The village shall be deemed to have consented to a
proposed transfer or assignment if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within one hundred twenty (120) days following
receipt of written notice together with all necessary information as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public, unless the
requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer.
B. The grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed pending change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of
the grantee. The word "control", as used herein, is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised.
A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of
twenty percent (20%) of the voting shares of the grantee. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise
subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of
determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the village may investigate the legal, technical, and financial
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee and/or assignee shall reasonably cooperate with the village's investigation.
C. The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee, franchise, or control thereof, shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of
the village in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise.
D. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village shall not be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to
substantial completion of the initial construction of the proposed system.
E. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor(s) in interest executing a written acceptance of the franchise
agreement. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-26: BOOKS, RECORDS, REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS:

necessary or desirable for the enforcement of the franchise, books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of the grantee applicable to the
cable television system, at any time during normal business hours; provided however, that where volume and convenience necessitate, the grantee
may require inspection to take place on the grantee premises.
2. The following records and/or reports are to be made available to the village upon request, but not more frequently than on a quarterly basis, unless
mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the village:

Should federal or state law permit further rate regulation beyond the basic service, the village may assume such rate regulation and adopt appropriate
procedures for such regulation. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-31: INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION, FORECLOSURE, RECEIVERSHIP; REMOVAL OF SYSTEM:
A. Involuntary Termination:
1. In addition to all other rights and powers retained by the village under this chapter or otherwise, the village may terminate the franchise agreement
and all rights and privileges of the grantee hereunder in the event of a substantial breach of its terms and conditions. A substantial breach by the
grantee shall include:
a. The grantee continues to violate a material provision of the franchise or any material rule, order, regulation or determination after written notice
from the village and reasonable opportunity to cure.
b. The grantee practices any material fraud in its conduct in obtaining or operating the franchise.
c. The grantee fails to begin or complete system construction, or to complete any upgrade of the cable system required in a franchise agreement.
d. The grantee fails to pay taxes or franchise fees, or penalties when and as due the village.
e. The grantee fails to maintain required insurance coverage.
f. The grantee fails to restore systemwide service after forty eight (48) consecutive hours of interrupted service, provided the grantee's failure to
restore systemwide service is not caused by circumstances or events beyond the grantee's reasonable control.
g. Insolvency or bankruptcy of the grantee.
h. The grantee transfers the franchise without village approval pursuant to section 8-4-25 of this chapter.
i. The grantee abandons its franchise. The grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned its franchise if it wilfully refuses or is unable to operate the
cable system as required by this franchise, when there is no event beyond the grantee's control that prevents the operation of the cable system,
and where operation would not endanger the health or safety of the public or property.
2. The foregoing shall not constitute a major breach if the violation occurs but is without fault of the grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances
beyond its control. The grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its directors, officers or
employees.
3. The village, at its option, may make a written demand that the grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order or determination under or pursuant
to the franchise. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand is received by the grantee
without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the village may place the issue of
termination of the franchise before the village board. The village shall give the grantee written notice, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of
such meeting of the village board, of its intent to request such termination and the time and place of the board meeting. Public notice shall be given
of the meeting and the issue(s) which the board is to consider.
4. The village board shall hear and consider the issue(s) and shall hear any person interested therein and shall determine findings of fact concerning
whether or not any violation by the grantee has occurred.
5. If the village board determines that the violation by the grantee was the fault of the grantee and within its control, the board may, by ordinance,
declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be involuntarily terminated; however, the village shall also allow the grantee an opportunity for
compliance within such period as the board may fix, which period shall be reasonable to effect compliance.
6. The issue of involuntary termination may automatically be placed upon the village's agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The
village may then terminate the franchise forthwith upon finding that the grantee has failed to achieve compliance or it may further extend the period at
its discretion.
7. If, upon revocation of grantee's franchise, the village does not elect to purchase the cable system, and no sale of the cable system is made to a
successor grantee, then the village shall require that grantee terminate and dismantle the cable system, including its wiring, equipment, headend
facilities, if located within the village limits, and related appurtenances; except, that in the event that the grantee is providing telecommunications
services as defined by the cable act, the grantee shall not be required to remove those facilities which provide said services. Upon completion of
termination and dismantling of the cable system, grantee shall, upon direction by the village, restore any property, public or private, to the condition in
which it existed prior to erection or construction of the cable system, including any improvements made to such property subsequent to construction
of the system. Restoring of village property, including all public streets and public ways as defined herein, and other public lands, shall be in
accordance with the directions and specifications of the village set forth herein and all applicable laws. Grantee shall restore said public streets,
public ways and properties at its expense.
B. Foreclosure: Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the system, the grantee shall notify the village of such fact, and
such notification shall be treated as a notification that a change in control of the grantee has taken place, and the provisions of the franchise governing
the consent of the village to such change in control of the grantee shall apply.
C. Receivership: The village shall have the right to cancel a franchise one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver, or trustee, to
take over and conduct the business of the grantee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 340/522
1. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after his/her election or appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions
of this chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder or presented a reasonable plan for said remedy; and
2. Such receiver or trustee, within the one hundred twenty (120) days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having
jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by each and every provision of this chapter and the
franchise granted to the grantee, or as may otherwise be agreed to by the village.
D. Removal Of System: Upon termination of the rights granted in a franchise agreement pursuant to this chapter, the grantee shall remove designated
portions of the cable television system from the streets and public property within the village as may be required to serve the public interest. Upon such
notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished or an existing bond maintained by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this expense. (Ord. 00-

modify any of the provisions herein to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the full intent and purpose of this chapter to the extent
practicable and enforceable. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-33: LANDLORD/TENANT:
A. Interference With Cable Service Prohibited: Neither the owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling nor his agent or representative shall interfere with
the right of any tenant or lawful resident thereof to receive cable television service, cable installation or maintenance from a cable television grantee
regulated by and lawfully operating under a valid and existing franchise issued by the village.
B. Penalties And Charges To Tenants For Service Prohibited: Neither the owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling nor his agent or representative
shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or resident or forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident, or discriminate in any way
against such tenant or resident, who requests or receives cable television service from a grantee operating under a valid and existing cable television
franchise issued by the village. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-34: VIOLATIONS; NOTICE AND PROCEDURES:

reason to believe that a grantee has committed a certain violation of this chapter or the franchise agreement, the village may act to remedy the violation.
A. Remedies Retained: No provision of this chapter shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the village to seek or obtain judicial relief from a
violation of any provision of the franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement, or directive promulgated thereunder. Neither the existence of other
remedies identified in this chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the village to recover monetary
damages, except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed, for such violation by the grantee, or judicial enforcement of the grantee's
obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief or mandate, or any other remedy available contractually, at law or in equity.
B. Liquidated Damages: By acceptance of the franchise, each grantee shall agree that failure to comply with any time and performance requirements as
stipulated in this chapter and the franchise agreement will result in damage to the village that is not readily ascertainable. The applicable franchise
agreement shall include provisions for liquidated damages to be paid by the grantee, in amounts set forth in the applicable franchise agreement and
chargeable to a security fund therein created.
C. Violation Procedures:
1. Notice Of Violations: Written notice shall be given to a grantee setting forth the nature of the violation and a reasonable period of time for a grantee
to correct the violation. Unless the village determines that the violation is of such a nature that a lesser period of time is warranted for remedying the
violation, a grantee shall be given thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to remedy the violation.
2. Answer To Notice Of Violations:
a. Within thirty (30) days, or such other period of time specified by the village in its notice to a grantee, a grantee shall respond in writing to the
village:
(1) That it contests the village's notice of violation and requests an opportunity to be heard as provided herein. A grantee shall submit supporting
documentation with its response to the notice; or
(2) That it contests the village's notice of violation for the reasons that the violation was beyond the reasonable control of a grantee and requests
an opportunity to be heard as provided herein. A grantee shall submit supporting documentation with its response to the notice; or
(3) That a grantee will remedy the violation within the time specified by the village in its notice to a grantee.
b. If a grantee contends that an extended period of time is reasonably needed to remedy the violation, it shall submit a written request for an
extension, together with supporting documentation that a grantee cannot reasonably remedy the violation within the time period specified by the
village in its notice to a grantee. The village shall not unreasonably deny an extension of time to remedy the violation. If the village grants the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 341/522
extension, a grantee shall proceed to remedy the violation within the extended time prescribed; provided, that a grantee also informs the village on
a regular basis of the steps being taken to remedy the violation.
3. Hearing: The village shall give a grantee not less than fourteen (14) days' written notice of the date, time and place of the public hearing to be held
before the village board. At the public hearing, the village board shall hear and determine the issues and render its findings and its decision. If a
hearing officer has been appointed by the village, the hearing officer shall hear the relevant evidence and shall render a record of the administrative
hearing and recommended findings and decision to the village board.
4. Determination: If the grantee fails to submit a written response to the village's notice of violation as provided in subsection C2 of this section, or if a
grantee fails to remedy the violation within the time period specified by the village in its notice to a grantee, or any extensions thereto granted by the
village, or if the village board is persuaded after a hearing that a grantee has committed a violation as provided herein, the village board may, after
giving a grantee an opportunity to be heard:
a. Order a grantee to remedy the violation within a reasonable period of time specified by the village board.
b. Assess liquidated damages against a grantee in accordance with the franchise agreement.
c. Impose any lesser sanction permitted by a franchise agreement.
5. Judicial Relief Not Barred: No provision of this section shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the franchising authority to seek or obtain
judicial relief to enforce the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)
8-4-35: LIQUIDATED DAMAGES:
A. Amounts: Because grantee's failure to comply with or to perform certain obligations under this chapter or the franchise agreement, or its failure to do so
in a timely manner, may result in damage to the village that is difficult to determine, the village and the grantee agree that the grantee shall pay to the
village liquidated damages as the liquidated sum or sums to be reasonably paid in light of the anticipated loss caused by or resulting from the specified
violation, default and resulting injury as specified from time to time in section 1-14-1 of this code. (Ord. 09-3495, 2-9-2009)

an opportunity to cure the violation as provided herein.
D. Effect On Grantee's Franchise Duties: The assessment and collection of liquidated damages shall not affect grantee's obligation to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, the agreement, or applicable law.
E. Other Remedies: If the village elects to assess liquidated damages, such election shall constitute the exclusive remedy for a period of thirty (30) days.
Thereafter, if the grantee remains in noncompliance with the requirement of this chapter or the franchise agreement, the village may pursue any
available remedy. (Ord. 00-2845, 2-28-2000)

3. No continuance(s) of such a hearing shall be authorized by the village manager, or his or her designee, at such hearing except where absolutely
necessary to protect the right of the parties. The lack of preparation of a party does not constitute cause for a continuance.
4. Such hearings are not a meeting of a public body and, therefore, consistent with the provisions of the Illinois open meetings act, shall be closed to
the public and only the village manager, or his or her designee, the person(s) requesting the hearing, and any persons who are expected to testify
may be physically present or participate electronically in the hearing.

6. Person(s) requesting such a hearing may also request in writing, in advance, of the village manager, or his or her designee, that their respective
personal appearance(s) at such hearing, by their physical presence or electronic participation, be waived, and the village manager, or his or her
designee, may, in his or her sole discretion, grant such requested waiver(s), but only if the village manager, or his or her designee, determines that
no party will be placed at a substantial disadvantage at such hearing by reason of a lack of opportunity for cross examination of those person(s) who
will not appear at such hearing.

employee(s), agent(s), tenant(s), family member(s), or other occupant(s) of the premises serviced by the village system;
4. The person liable for the utility bill has taken any necessary action to correct the cause of the excess consumption of water, as evidenced by a
reduction in their consumption to typical levels; and

C. Reduction Of Sewer Usage Charge: When all the conditions precedent set forth within subsection B of this section are met for a water usage charge
adjustment, the village manager, or his or her designee, may but shall not be obligated to, at his or her sole discretion, reduce the sewer usage charge
portion of the utility bill by up to a maximum amount that is based upon the customer's annual average monthly usage. (Ord. 12-3672, 2-13-2012)

subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the village prior to the user's
initiation of the changes. (Ord. 09-3536, 8-17-2009)
B. National Pretreatment Standards:
1. Effect Of Standards; Prohibition: Upon the promulgation of the national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the
national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter and chapters 7 and 9 of this title for sources in that subcategory, shall
immediately supersede the limitations imposed hereunder. The director of public works shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR section 403.12. No industrial user shall increase the use of process water or dilute a discharge as a substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with any pretreatment standard or requirement.
2. Modification Of Standards: Where the village POTW achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by national pretreatment standards, the village
may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the national pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean
reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state
in the effluent which is achieved by the system in ninety five percent (95%) of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set
forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of title 40 of the code of federal regulations, part 403, "general pretreatment regulations for existing and new sources of
pollution", promulgated pursuant to the act. The village may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the national pretreatment standards if the
requirements contained in 40 CFR part 403 section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. State requirements
and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this chapter
and chapters 7 and 9 of this title. The village reserves the right to establish more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW if
deemed necessary to comply with the objectives of this chapter and chapters 7 and 9 of this title.
3. Reporting Requirements:
a. Baseline Monitoring Report: Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred
eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under title 40 CFR section 403.6(a)(4),
whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge into the POTW shall submit to the director of public works a report which contains the applicable information pursuant to the provisions
of title 40 CFR section 403.12(b). At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director of public works a report which contains the
applicable information pursuant to the provisions of title 40 CFR section 403.12(b). New sources shall also include in their report information on the
method of pretreatment the sources intend to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information
requested in accord with title 40 CFR section 403.12.
b. Compliance Date Report: Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a
new source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the director of public works a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units
in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
industrial user, and certified to by a qualified professional.
c. Periodic Compliance Reports:
(1) All significant users shall submit to the director of public works during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the director of public works, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which, during the reporting period,
exceeded the average daily flow reported in the user's permit application. At the discretion of the director of public works and in consideration of
such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director of public works may agree to alter the months during which
the above reports are to be submitted.
(2) The director of public works may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection B3c(1)
of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain
the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where
requested by the director of public works, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analyses and sampling shall be performed in

C. Show Cause Order: The director of public works may order any user which causes or contributes to violation of this chapter or chapter 7 or 8 of this title,
the wastewater permit or an order issued hereunder or thereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice
of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate officer. Whether or not a duly notified industrial user appears as noticed,
enforcement action may be pursued as appropriate.
D. Compliance Order: When the director of public works finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or chapter 7 or 8 of
this title or a permit or order issued, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are
properly operated, and compliance is achieved. Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate
to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices.
E. Cease And Desist Orders:
1. When the director of public works finds that an industrial user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or chapter 7 or 8 of this title or any
permit or order issued, the director of public works may issue an order to cease and desist all illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately.
2. In an emergency, the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone by the director of public works.
3. In nonemergency situations, the cease and desist order may be used to suspend or permanently revoke industrial wastewater discharge permits.
4. The cease and desist order may order the industrial user to take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
F. Administrative Permit Surcharge Fees: Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or chapter 7 or 8 of this title, any user who is found to have
violated any provision of this chapter or chapter 7 or 8 of this title, or permits and orders issued, shall be assessed an administrative permit surcharge
fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in section 1-14-1 of this code per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or
continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge, and
the director of public works shall have such other collection remedies as may be required to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines,
penalties, and permit surcharge fees shall constitute a lien against the user's property. Industrial users desiring to dispute such permit surcharge fees
must file a request for the director of public works to reconsider the permit surcharge fees within ten (10) days of being notified of the permit surcharge
fees. Where the director of public works believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving the
request from the industrial user.
G. Emergency Suspensions:
1. The director of public works may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of an industrial user whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or causes interference with the POTW.
2. Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings set forth in subsection H of this section are initiated against the user.
3. An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the cause
of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of any hearing initiated against
the user in conjunction with such imminent endangerment.
H. Termination Of Permit:
1. Industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the village. Any user who violates the
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any applicable state and federal law, or the following conditions, is subject to permit
termination:
a. Violation of permit conditions;
b. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
c. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
d. Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
e. Failure to pay fines or sewer charges;
f. Tampering with monitoring equipment; and
g. Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted facility.
2. Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show cause,
under subsection C of this section, why the proposed action should not be taken.

obstruction shall be jointly and severally borne by the owner(s) and/or operator(s).
F. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee, access to any property or facility is a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this chapter. It shall be a violation of this chapter for a person who owns and/or is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit
to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity to deny and/or unreasonably delay the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee,
reasonable access to the property and/or facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
G. If the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee, has been refused access to any part of any property and/or facility from which stormwater is
discharged, and if a representative of the Village is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that said property and/or facility may be in violation
of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or take one (1) or more sample(s) as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed
to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then
the Director of Public Works, or his or her designee, may seek issuance of an administrative search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction in
order to perform any of the inspection and/or monitoring activity(ies) authorized and/or required by this chapter. (Ord. 17-3950, 6-12-2017)

discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the Municipal Storm Drainage System or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural
BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or facility, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit connection or illegal discharge, may
be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of
a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 17-3950, 6-12-2017)
9-10-12: WATERCOURSE PROTECTION:
Every person owning, leasing, and/or occupying property through which a watercourse passes shall be jointly and severally responsible to keep and
maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, fill, and other obstacles that would pollute,
contaminate, or significantly retard or impair the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner, occupant, and/or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 17-3950, 6-12-2017)

10-9-3: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
10-9-3-300: REGULATED DEVELOPMENT:
The performance standards, application requirements, and other provisions of this chapter apply to regulated development, as determined by the
enforcement officer.
No person, firm, corporation, or governmental agency shall commence any development regulated by this chapter on any lot or parcel of land without first
obtaining a watershed development permit from the stormwater management commission, if applicable, or from the certified community, as applicable to
the case. A permit shall be issued if the proposed development meets the requirements of this chapter or its certified community equivalent. A watershed
development permit is required for any development, including finalization of a plat, replat, planned unit development (PUD), or manufactured home park
site plan, that:
10-9-3-300.01. Is located in a regulatory floodplain; or
10-9-3-300.02. Is located in a flood prone area with one hundred (100) acres of tributary drainage area or more; or
10-9-3-300.03. Is located in a depressional storage area with a storage volume of 0.75 acre-foot or more for the base flood; or
10-9-3-300.04. Creates a wetland impact within an area defined as waters of the U.S. or isolated waters of Lake County, or isolated waters of Barrington;
or
10-9-3-300.05. Modifies the flood prone area of a channel where the tributary drainage area is twenty (20) or more acres; or
10-9-3-300.06. Includes the total land area of an ownership parcel that results in:
A. More than one acre of new impervious surface area; or
B. More than three (3) acres of hydrologically disturbed area, unless the total new impervious surface area is less than one-half (0.5) acre; or
C. An impervious surface area ratio of fifty percent (50%) or greater, unless the total new impervious surface area is less than one-half (0.5) acre.
The term "new" in this section 10-9-3 refers to impervious surface area created after the original effective date of this chapter (October 18, 1992).
Redevelopment of previously developed sites shall maintain existing storage volume and shall not increase the rate of runoff from the site. The
applicant shall provide supporting data and calculations to the satisfaction of the enforcement officer to ensure the site design either provides a
watershed benefit or meets the requirements of subsection 10-9-5-502.03 of this chapter. New development on partially developed sites shall meet
the release rate criteria in subsection 10-9-5-502.01 of this chapter for the new development, if the new development exceeds the thresholds in
subsection 10-9-3-300.06A, B, or C of this section; or
10-9-3-300.07. Any public road development meeting both of the following criteria:
A. One and one-half (1.5) acres or more of new impervious surface; and
B. One and one-half (1.5) acres or more of new impervious surface per mile, for linear or nonlinear projects; or
10-9-3-300.08. Any development that hydrologically disturbs five thousand (5,000) square feet or more. This development activity shall at a minimum meet
the soil erosion and sediment control performance standards of section 10-9-6-600, "Performance Standards", of this chapter with associated application
requirements. Public road developments are required to meet the soil erosion and sediment control standards only for those projects which require permits
according to subsections 10-9-3-300.01, 10-9-3-300.02, 10-9-3-300.03, 10-9-3-300.04, 10-9-3-300.05 and 10-9-3-300.07 of this section; or
10-9-3-300.09. Any activity to a building in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) as described in FEMA publication 480 "National Flood Insurance Program
Flood Management Requirements". (Ord. 16-3877, 1-11-2016)
10-9-3-301: CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY AND DEVELOPMENT PHASING:
In order to preclude inappropriate phasing of developments to circumvent the intent of this chapter, when a proposed development activity will occur on a
lot or parcel of land that has contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned in whole, or in part, by the same property owner at the time of subdivision
subsequent to October 18, 1992, then the criteria as defined in this section will be applied to the total land area compiled from aggregate ownership
parcels. If this aggregate ownership parcel area is greater than the minimum area requirements defined in section 10-9-3-300, "Regulated Development",
of this chapter, then a watershed development permit will be required. (Ord. 16-3877, 1-11-2016)

10-9-5-505.01. Buffer areas shall be required for all areas defined as either waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County or isolated
waters of Barrington. Buffer areas are divided into two (2) types, linear buffers and water body buffers.
"Waters of the United States" is a defined term (subsection 10-9-18A, "Appendix A - Definitions", of this chapter) in this chapter and refers to areas that are
under the jurisdictional authority and regulated by the United States army corps of engineers. "Isolated waters of Lake County" and the "isolated waters of
Barrington" are under the jurisdictional authority of this chapter and are each defined terms in subsection 10-9-18A, "Appendix A - Definitions", of this
chapter.
A. Linear buffers shall be designated along both sides of all channels meeting the definition of "waters of the United States" or "isolated waters of Lake
County" or "isolated waters of Barrington". The buffer width shall be determined as follows:
1. When the channel has a watershed greater than twenty (20) acres but less than one square mile, the minimum buffer shall be fifty feet (50') on
each side of the channel.
2. When the channel has a watershed greater than one square mile, the minimum buffer shall be thirty feet (30') on each side of the channel.
3. Linear high quality aquatic resources and streams with an index of biotic integrity (IBI) greater than forty (40) shall have a minimum buffer width of
one hundred feet (100') on each side of the channel. (Initial IBI based on IEPA Illinois water quality report, biannual. A site specific IBI assessment
may override this report.)
B. Water body buffers shall encompass all nonlinear bodies of water meeting the definition of either "waters of the United States" or "isolated waters of
Lake County" or "isolated waters of Barrington". The buffer width shall be determined as follows:
1. For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area greater than one-third (1/3) acre but less than one acre, a minimum buffer width of thirty
feet (30') shall be established.
2. For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area greater than or equal to one acre but less than two and one-half (2.5) acres, a minimum
buffer width of forty feet (40') shall be established.
3. For all water bodies or wetlands with a total surface area greater than or equal to two and one-half (2.5) acres, a minimum buffer width of fifty feet
(50') shall be established.
10-9-5-505.02. Nonlinear high quality aquatic resources shall have a minimum buffer width of one hundred feet (100').
10-9-5-505.03. In areas where state or federal threatened and endangered species are present or for an Illinois natural area inventory site, buffer widths
may be modified upon approval of the enforcement officer. Any modification requires approval by the enforcement officer following consultation with the
Illinois department of natural resources or United States fish and wildlife service.
10-9-5-505.04. Buffer areas for water bodies meeting the definition of "waters of the United States" or "isolated waters of Lake County" or "isolated waters
of Barrington" shall extend from the ordinary high water mark. Buffer areas for wetlands shall extend from the edge of the delineated wetland. A property
may contain a buffer area that originates from waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County on another property.

10-9-5-505.06. Access through buffer areas shall be provided, when necessary, for maintenance purposes.
10-9-5-505.07. All roadside drainage ditches, existing excavated detention facilities (as of the amended date of this chapter, August 10, 1999), borrow pits,
quarries, and improvements to existing public road developments or alignments are exempt from buffer requirements.
10-9-5-505.08. Stormwater discharges that enter a buffer shall have appropriate energy dissipation measures to prevent erosion and scour.
10-9-5-505.09. All buffer areas shall be maintained free from development including disturbance of the soil, dumping or filling, erection of structures, and
placement of impervious surfaces except as follows:
A. A buffer area may be used for passive recreation (e.g., birdwatching, walking, jogging, bicycling, horseback riding, and picnicking) and it may contain
pedestrian, bicycle, or equestrian trails.
B. Structures and impervious surfaces (including trails, paths) may occupy a maximum of twenty percent (20%) of the buffer surface area provided the
runoff from such facilities is diverted away from the waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake County or isolated waters of Barrington or
such runoff is directed to enter the buffer area as unconcentrated flow.
C. Utility maintenance, construction of stormwater facilities, and maintenance of stormwater facilities shall be allowed.
D. Boat docks, boathouses, and piers shall be allowed and the provisions of subsection 10-9-5-505.09B of this section shall apply.
E. Buffer areas hydrologically disturbed by allowing construction or as part of a revegetation plan shall be revegetated using the "Native Plant Guide
For Streams And Stormwater Facilities In Northeastern Illinois", NRCS, et al. (as amended), as a minimum standard.
10-9-5-505.10. A minimum of a one foot (1') temporary construction buffer from the limits of the waters of the United States or isolated waters of Lake
County or isolated waters of Barrington shall be required unless the adjacent wetland is considered impacted or enhanced. The one foot (1') temporary
construction buffer shall be marked by construction fencing (IDOT standard) and installed prior to the start of all other construction activities. All other
construction activities, including soil erosion and sediment control features, shall take place on the nonwetland side of the construction fencing.

approval of the enforcement officer, provided that the total buffer area required is achieved adjacent to the waters of the United States or isolated waters of
Lake County or isolated waters of Barrington being buffered. The consultation process of the IDNR or U.S. fish and wildlife service may override the ability
to average buffer areas upon approval of the enforcement officer.
10-9-5-505.12. Preservation of buffer areas shall be provided by deed or plat restrictions.
10-9-5-505.13. The buffer area of a development site may be subtracted from the water quality volume required. (Ord. 16-3877, 1-11-2016)

development site outflows based on the assumption the downstream tile will cease to function.
4. Drain tiles within the disturbed portions of the ownership parcel shall be replaced or intercepted and connected into the proposed stormwater
management system or a bypass. The system or bypass shall be of an equivalent size.
5. Drain tiles located within an ownership parcel may be removed or disabled provided that a maintainable outlet exists or is installed to prevent flood
damages to off site properties.
6. If the development stormwater management system depends on existing drain tiles for stormwater conveyance or water surface elevation control,
a maintainable outlet is required.
7. The locations for existing drain tiles within the ownership parcel shall be defined using the subsurface drainage inventory. Recorded deed or plat
restrictions shall be provided for all existing and replaced drain tiles within the ownership parcel which are part of the stormwater management
system. Drain tiles that service a single parcel of property may be excused from this requirement upon approval of the enforcement officer.

before excavation begins and must be maintained throughout the construction period.
G. New or relocated channels shall be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, shall be completed prior to diversion of water
into the new channel.
H. Streams and channels shall be expected to withstand all events up to the base flood without increased erosion. The use of armoring of banks using
bulkheads, riprap, and other materials shall be avoided. Armoring shall only be used where erosion cannot be prevented in any other way such as
use of vegetation or gradual slopes. Such armoring shall have minimal impact on other properties and the existing land configuration.
I. A minimum maintenance easement of twelve feet (12') from top of bank is required along one side of all channels draining twenty (20) or more acres.
All drainage easements shall be accessible to vehicular equipment; however, linear accessibility for vehicular equipment is not required.

upon installation and again upon removal of construction crossings.
5. The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after installation, unless an extension of time is granted by the
enforcement officer.
10-9-5-506.03. Overland Flow Paths: The following items are general performance standards for overland flow paths and do not excuse development
from meeting all other requirements of this chapter.
A. All areas of development must be provided with an overland flow path that will pass the base flood flow without damage to structures or property. If
the upstream drainage area is less than twenty (20) acres, the storm sewer pipe and inlet systems sized for the base flood can be constructed in lieu
of providing an overland flow path.
B. The flow rate for a base flood shall be used to establish overland flow path limits, and it shall include all on site and off site tributary areas in
accordance with section 10-9-5-501, "Runoff Calculations", of this chapter.

feet (2') above the design high water elevation within the emergency overflow structure.
10-9-5-507.03. Single pipe outlets shall have a minimum inside diameter of twelve inches (12"). If design release rates call for smaller outlet, a design that
minimizes the possibility of clogging shall be used. Minimum outlet restrictor size shall be four inches (4") in diameter provided there is adequate
downstream capacity. Detention volume and corresponding high water level required for a development shall be determined by using the appropriate
release rates specified in section 10-9-5-502, "Release Rates And Discharges", of this chapter, regardless of a minimum outlet restrictor size.
10-9-5-507.04. Stormwater infiltration, retention, and detention facilities required to meet a development's discharge requirements shall be designed to
bypass off site tributary flow from streams and channels unless approved by the enforcement officer.
10-9-5-507.05. Any development involving the construction, modification, or removal of a "dam" as defined in subsection 10-9-18A, "Appendix A -
Definitions", of this chapter per 17 Illinois administrative code part 3702 (rules for construction of dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or a

C. The maximum detention volume safety factor shall be 1.5.
10-9-5-508.02. No on stream detention shall be allowed with an off site to on site tributary drainage area ratio greater than ten to one (10:1) except for
development providing a watershed benefit.
10-9-5-508.03. On stream detention shall not be permissible if the tributary drainage area is greater than six hundred forty (640) acres except for detention
that provides a watershed benefit.
10-9-5-508.04. The release rate shall be 0.04 cubic feet per second per acre of the total tributary drainage area (on site and off site) at the elevation
created by impoundment of the on site 2-year storm volume plus the detention volume safety factor, and 0.15 cubic feet per second per acre of the total
tributary drainage area (on site and off site) at the elevation created by impoundment of the on site 100-year storm volume plus the detention volume
safety factor and the required compensatory storage. The release rate and on site detention volume shall be calculated using the 24-hour storm event.
This release rate calculation shall be used unless other site conditions warrant further analysis and modification from this standard or unless watershed
specific release rates have been adopted.
10-9-5-508.05. On stream detention shall provide water quality treatment. One of the following two (2) methods shall be used:

or
2. The estimated construction cost as approved by the SMC for noncertified communities or by the corporate authorities of the village if the village is
a certified community of the applicant's proposed and approved on site stormwater storage, including land costs.
D. A fund will be maintained by the village or the SMC for noncertified communities for each of the four (4) major Lake County watersheds for the
purpose of identifying and controlling all revenues and expenditures resulting from fee in lieu of on site stormwater storage approvals. All fee in lieu
of on site stormwater storage revenues received from each watershed shall be deposited in these funds for use within that watershed. A certified
community may opt to allow SMC to administer fee in lieu of revenues and expenditures through execution of an intergovernmental agreement
specifying that arrangement.
E. The following requirements must be met before a fee in lieu of on site stormwater storage will be approved:
1. The downstream stormwater management system has "adequate downstream stormwater capacity" (see subsection 10-9-18A, "Appendix A -
Definitions", of this chapter); and
2. The SMC for noncertified communities or the community elected board of officials in a certified community has an adopted fee in lieu of on site
stormwater storage program.
F. Fee in lieu of on site stormwater storage revenues may be used to plan, design, or construct an upgrade to existing or future stormwater
management systems if the upgrade is consistent with a basin plan, floodplain study, or stormwater system improvement that has been approved by
the SMC for noncertified communities or the community elected board of officials in a certified community.
10-9-5-509.03. The fee in lieu of on site stormwater storage option shall be authorized for all public road developments on existing alignments provided the
downstream drainage system has adequate stormwater capacity and that it will not result in negative impacts to the drainage system. (Ord. 16-3877, 1-11-

10-9-6: SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL REQUIREMENTS:
10-9-6-600: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 438/522
Soil erosion and sediment control related measures are required to be constructed and maintained for any land disturbance activity permitted under
section 10-9-3, "General Provisions", of this chapter. The following requirements shall be met:
10-9-6-600.01. Soil disturbance shall be conducted in such a manner as to minimize erosion. Areas of the development site that are not to be graded shall
be protected from construction traffic or other disturbance until final seeding is performed. Soil stabilization measures shall consider the time of year, site
conditions, and the use of temporary or permanent measures.
10-9-6-600.02. Properties and channels adjoining development sites shall be protected from erosion and sedimentation. At points where concentrated flow
leaves a development site, energy dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel as necessary to
provide a nonerosive velocity of flow from the structure to the watercourse so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and functions are
maintained and protected.
10-9-6-600.03. Sediment control measures shall be constructed prior to the commencement of hydrologic disturbance of upland areas.
10-9-6-600.04. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of active
hydrologic disturbance, or redisturbance, consistent with the following criteria or using an appropriate measure as approved by the enforcement officer:
A. Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching, sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
B. Disturbance to areas or embankments having slopes equal to or steeper than three horizontal to one vertical (3H:1V) shall be minimized; disturbed
slopes shall be stabilized with staked-in-place sod, appropriately specified mat or blanket, or other appropriate measure(s) in combination with
seeding.
C. Erosion control blanket shall be required on all interior detention basin side slopes between normal water level and high water level.
D. The seven (7) calendar day stabilization requirement may be precluded by snow cover or where land disturbing activities will resume within fourteen
(14) calendar days from when the active hydrologic disturbance ceased, provided that the disturbed portion of the development site has appropriate
soil erosion and sediment controls.
10-9-6-600.05. Land disturbance activities in streams shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance activities are unavoidable, the following
requirements shall be met:
A. Where stream construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of nonerosive material.
B. The time and area of disturbance of a stream shall be kept to a minimum. The stream, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within forty
eight (48) hours after channel disturbance is completed or interrupted.
10-9-6-600.06. Soil erosion and sediment control measures shall be appropriate with regard to the amount of tributary drainage area as follows:
A. Disturbed areas draining greater than five thousand (5,000) square feet but less than one acre shall, at a minimum, be protected by a filter barrier
(including filter fences, which at a minimum, meet the applicable sections of the "AASHTO Standard Specification 288-00", or equivalent control
measures) to control all off site runoff. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet (25'), in the direction of flow, may be used as
an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
B. Disturbed areas draining more than one but fewer than five (5) acres shall, at a minimum, be protected by a sediment trap or equivalent control
measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
C. Disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres shall, at a minimum, be protected by a sediment basin with a perforated filtered riser pipe or
equivalent control measure at a point downslope of the disturbed area.
D. Sediment basins shall have both a permanent pool (dead storage) and additional volume (live storage) with each volume equal to the runoff amount
of a 2-year, 24-hour event over the on site hydrologically disturbed tributary drainage area to the sediment basin. 2-year storm runoff volumes versus
site runoff curve numbers are shown in subsection 10-9-18K, "Appendix K - Detention Volume Versus Percent Impervious", of this chapter. The
available sediment volume below normal water level, in addition to the dead storage volume, shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load
generated from the site over the duration of the construction period. For construction periods exceeding one year, the 1-year sediment load and a
sediment removal schedule may be submitted.
If the detention basin for the proposed development condition of the site is used for sediment basin, the above volume requirements will be explicitly
met. Until the site is finally stabilized, the basin permanent pool of water shall meet the above volume requirements and have a filtered perforated
riser protecting the outflow pipe.

10-9-7: REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN AND FLOODWAY REQUIREMENTS:
10-9-7-700: LOCATION OF REGULATORY FLOODPLAIN, BASE FLOOD ELEVATION, AND REGULATORY FLOODWAY:
10-9-7-700.01. The regulatory floodplain is delineated within a development by projecting the base flood elevation (BFE) onto the site topography.
10-9-7-700.02. The BFE shall be as delineated by the 100-year flood profiles, as indicated on the floodplain studies noted in subsections A through D of
this section:
A. SMC floodplain studies, adopted by the SMC for regulatory use after receiving an independent technical review and a sixty (60) day public technical
review and comment period. Approved SMC floodplain studies, maps, and profiles shall be posted on the SMC website. SMC floodplain studies,
including maps and profiles, shall be effective where:
1. The elevations exceed the current effective flood insurance study (FIS) maps and profiles, provided that the study has been submitted to IDNR or
FEMA for approval; or
2. The base flood elevations had not previously been determined in the current effective FIS and are not within areas under the jurisdiction of the
IDNR/OWR.
B. Should no SMC approved regulatory floodplain profile exist for the site, the FEMA flood insurance study and profiles, as listed in subsection 10-9-
18C, "Appendix C - FEMA Flood Insurance Study Maps And Profiles", of this chapter.
C. In the case of FEMA delineated "AH zones" the elevation noted on the map shall be the BFE. In the case of FEMA delineated "AO zones" the BFE
shall be the depth number shown on the map added to the highest adjacent grade, or at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade if no
depth number is provided.
D. When no base flood elevation exists, the BFE shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using an appropriate model or technique as
approved by the SMC or IDNR/OWR. For riverine flood prone areas with greater than one hundred (100) acres of tributary drainage area, nonriverine
flood prone areas with greater than twenty (20) acres of tributary drainage area, and all mapped special flood hazard areas regardless of drainage
area, the BFE determination shall be submitted to SMC for approval prior to issuance of a watershed development permit. The BFE determination for
nonriverine depressional floodplains with less than twenty (20) acres of tributary drainage area shall be reviewed and approved by the enforcement
officer. BFE determinations shall be based on the critical duration event.
1. Where a channel has a tributary drainage area of six hundred forty (640) acres or more, the analyses in this subsection D shall be submitted to
SMC for approval by IDNR/OWR.
2. For a nonriverine regulatory floodplain, the historic flood of record (as determined by the enforcement officer according to this subsection D) plus
three feet (3') may be used for the BFE instead of performing a detailed hydrologic and hydraulic study.
10-9-7-700.03. The location of the regulatory floodway shall be as delineated on the maps referenced in subsection 10-9-18C, "Appendix C - FEMA Flood
Insurance Study Maps And Profiles", of this chapter. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the regulatory floodway boundary,
IDNR/OWR should be contacted.
10-9-7-700.04. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the application of these regulations to land that can be demonstrated by engineering survey to lie
within any regulatory floodplain. Conversely, any lands (except for those located in a regulatory floodway) that can be demonstrated by a topographic
survey certified by a registered professional engineer or registered land surveyor to lie beyond the regulatory floodplain, and show to the satisfaction of the
enforcement officer, to have been higher than the BFE as of the date of the first floodplain map denoting the site to be in a special flood hazard area and
as of the date of the current effective map, shall not be considered to be located in the special flood hazard area.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 441/522

mitigation criteria and those of sections 10-9-7-700, "Location Of Regulatory Floodplain, Base Flood Elevation, And Regulatory Floodway", 10-9-7-702,
"Regulatory Floodplain Performance Standards", 10-9-7-704, "Compensatory Storage Performance Standards", 10-9-7-705, "Public Health Protection
Standards", and 10-9-7-706, "Building Protection Requirements", of this chapter, and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations, and data
prepared by a registered professional engineer.
A. All effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the development of appropriate uses, other than bridge or culvert crossings or on stream
structures or dams, shall be replaced for all flood events up to and including the base flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance,
the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
1. Regulatory floodway conveyance,
K = (1.486/n) AR 2/3
where "n" is Manning's roughness coefficient, "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter.
2. The same Manning's n value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal,
state, or local unit of government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a
nonvegetative land cover.
B. Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance, in the design of excavations in the
regulatory floodway, between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions, and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on
adjoining properties. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used:
1. Water will expand no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
2. Water will contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
3. Water will not expand or contract faster than one foot (1') vertical for every ten feet (10') of the flooded stream's length.
4. All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
5. In the design of excavations in the regulatory floodway, erosion/scour protection shall be provided on land upstream and downstream of proposed
transition sections.
C. The development of all appropriate uses shall not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage, for all flood
events up to and including the base flood event. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion, and sedimentation will be
avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
D. In the case of on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water, an increase in upstream stage when compared to existing conditions
for all flood events up to and including the base flood event shall be contained within recorded easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not
required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing
up water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
E. General criteria for analysis of flood elevations:
1. The flood profiles, flows, and regulatory floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 10-9-700, "Location Of Regulatory
Floodplain, Base Flood Elevation, And Regulatory Floodway", of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base
conditions data to use.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 444/522
2. If the BFE at the site of the proposed development is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the
proposed development shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the base elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and
conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. Additional receiving stream elevations may be considered for design if appropriate
and approved by SMC or IDNR/OWR.
3. If the applicant is informed by IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream or upstream restrictive bridge or culvert is
scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed, or modified
within the next five (5) years, the proposed development shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing
conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert, or flood control project is built.
F. If the appropriate use will result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or a change in the BFE, the applicant shall submit to SMC the
information required to be issued a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from IDNR/OWR and FEMA. A public notice inviting public comment
on the proposed change in the BFE or location in the regulatory floodway will be issued by IDNR/OWR or its designee before a CLOMR is issued.
The application will not be considered complete until the CLOMR is received. No filling, grading, dredging, or excavating shall take place until a
conditional approval is issued by the enforcement officer. The construction or placement of structures within the currently effective floodway
boundary shall not take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by IDNR/OWR and FEMA, which revises the floodway boundary.
10-9-7-703.05. For those circumstances listed in subsections A through E of this section and located in a regulatory floodway, the following information
shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR or SMC:
A. Analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge, culvert crossings, and roadway approaches.
B. An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing or approach road is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating
the proposed flood profile.
C. Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage.

10-9-11-1102.01. If at any stage of the grading of any development site the enforcement officer determines that the nature of the site is such that further
work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the enforcement officer may
require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable additional protective measures be taken as is considered advisable to avoid
the likelihood of such peril. Additional protective measures may include, but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional
drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and recommendations of a licensed soils
engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made requirements for further work.
10-9-11-1102.02. Where the enforcement officer determines that storm damage may result or has resulted because the grading on any development site is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect
adjoining property or the public safety. On large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the enforcement officer may require that the

10-9-13-1302: CONDITIONS AND SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
10-9-13-1302.01. Upon consideration of the factors noted in section 10-9-13-1301, "Variance Criteria", of this chapter, and the intent of the chapter, the
enforcement officer may attach such conditions to the granting of a variance deemed necessary to further the purposes and objectives herein.
10-9-13-1302.02. Variances requested in connection with restoration of a historic site or building listed on the national register of historical places or
documented as worthy of preservation by the Illinois historic preservation agency may be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements
contained in this section 10-9-13.
10-9-13-1302.03. The enforcement officer shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of section 10-9-7-706, "Building
Protection Requirements", of this chapter, that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance
up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage, increase the risks to life and property, and
require that the applicant will acknowledge in a signed exception to title the assumption of the risks and liability and will pay upon approval of the variance
a recording fee above and beyond the usual permit review fee.
10-9-13-1302.04. In a regulatory floodplain without a regulatory floodway where the tributary drainage area is six hundred forty (640) acres or more, a
variance may not be granted that will result in a loss of the regulatory floodplain storage of greater than ten percent (10%) of the existing regulatory
floodplain storage on the site.
10-9-13-1302.05. Variances requested in connection with the redevelopment of previously developed sites, that will further the public policy goals of
downtown redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization, may be granted a variance provided the variance would not result in an increase in the
preredevelopment runoff rate or volume and there will exist adequate downstream stormwater capacity. No variance shall be granted pertaining to section
10-9-7, "Regulatory Floodplain And Floodway Requirements", of this chapter.
10-9-13-1302.06. Due to the unique nature of public road developments occurring in a narrow right of way instead of an expansive tract of land, variances
requested in connection with public road developments that will further the public policy of minimizing the condemnation of private or public property may
be granted using criteria more permissive than the requirements of section 10-9-13-1301, "Variance Criteria", of this chapter, to the minimum extent
necessary to achieve the minimal amount of condemnation. No variances shall be granted pertaining to subsection 10-9-7-701.02, "Development In The
Regulatory Floodplain Without Regulatory Floodway", of this chapter, and sections 10-9-7-703, "Regulatory Floodway Performance Standards", and 10-9-
7-707, "Bridge, Culvert Crossing, And Roadway Approach Performance Standards", of this chapter. (Ord. 16-3877, 1-11-2016)

E. Appendix E - Enforcement Officer Duties: This subsection E as a part of this duly adopted chapter, delineates requirements or duties required of and
accepted by a community and its designated enforcement officer. Certain requirements or duties specified by FEMA or IDNR/OWR are for the
purposes of that community obtaining or maintaining eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program and delegation of state permit
authority. These certain requirements or duties relate only to the intergovernmental relationship between a community and FEMA or IDNR/OWR, and
they do not and are not intended to create any third party beneficial rights in or for applicants, property owners, or others.
1. In certified communities, the appropriate development regulations officer shall be the enforcement officer for this chapter. In all other areas of Lake
County, the SMC chief engineer shall be this enforcement officer. One of the primary duties of the enforcement officer shall be to review all
watershed development applications and issue permits for those projects that are in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The enforcement
officer shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this chapter. If the enforcement officer is contracted by a certified community,
then the contract scope shall be comprehensive enough to cover all specified duties herein or the duties shall be shared with a coenforcement officer
who is an employee of the certified community.
2. The enforcement officer shall determine for each development if it is in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) using the criteria specified in section 10-
9-7-700, "Location Of Regulatory Floodplain, Base Flood Elevation, And Regulatory Floodway", of this chapter. If a site is in an SFHA, a
determination is required as to whether it is in a regulatory floodway, or a regulatory floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted, or
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 471/522
a flood prone area with a tributary drainage area equal to or greater than six hundred forty (640) acres, greater than one hundred (100) acres, or
greater than twenty (20) acres.
3. The enforcement officer shall ensure that an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is obtained or a letter stating that no dam safety permit is required if the
development includes a dam before the issuance of a watershed development permit. Reference subsection G, "Appendix G - IDNR/OWR Dam
Safety Permitting Guidelines", of this section.
4. Adopted basin plans and floodplain studies may be the basis for more specific regulations. These additional or more specific regulations will apply
only in the specific study area of the basin plan or floodplain study and supersede those of this chapter only upon amendment to the Lake County
watershed development ordinance and formal adoption of the basin plan or floodplain study by SMC.
5. To assure projects are built and maintained according to permitted plans, the enforcement officer shall determine applicable deed restrictions,
performance guarantees, as built drawings, and maintenance guarantees for projects that affect stormwater runoff characteristics, impact wetlands
or buffers, or impact floodplains. If such performance guarantees or other such adequate security as the enforcement officer may approve is
required, the amount shall be at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the estimated cost to complete construction of the stormwater management
system and soil erosion and sediment control measures required by the watershed development permit, which the estimated probable cost shall be
approved by the enforcement officer. The performance guarantee may be reduced upon verification of construction milestones or after approval of
the as built drawings and calculations. The performance guarantee shall be valid for a minimum of one year beyond the date of project completion or
two (2) years from the start of construction, whichever is greater. The performance guarantee shall not be reduced below ten percent (10%) of the
original value until project as built drawings are accepted. The performance guarantee may not be further reduced before the completion of a
minimum two (2) year maintenance period.
6. A registered professional engineer in the employ or under contract with SMC or certified community shall review any plans, calculations, or analyses
submitted by a registered professional engineer pursuant to the requirements of this chapter.
7. Proposed amendments to this chapter and appendices must be done in accordance with applicable state or federal law and approved by
IDNR/OWR and FEMA.
8. Prior to the issuance of a watershed development permit, and based on the reliance that the application requirements of sections 10-9-4-400, "Minor
Developments", 10-9-4-401, "Major Developments", 10-9-4-402, "Public Road Developments", 10-9-4-403, "IDNR/OWR Dam Safety Permit", and
10-9-7-701, "Application Requirements", of this chapter have been met, the enforcement officer shall further ensure that the applicant has obtained
and provided copies of any and all required federal, state, and local permits for development in the regulatory floodplain. Reference subsection H,
"Appendix H - Partial List Of Permits Required (When Applicable) For Development", of this section for a partial list of permits that may be applicable.
9. The enforcement officer shall "inspect" (as defined in subsection A, "Appendix A - Definitions", of this section) development projects before, during,
and upon completion of construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The
enforcement officer may require a preconstruction meeting as a condition of issuing a permit.
10. Enforcement officer duties:
a. IDNR/OWR has retained permit review and approval authority over the following:
(1) illinois department of natural resources projects, dams, or impoundment structures as defined in subsection A, "Appendix A - Definitions", of
this section and that meet the "permit required" criteria for dams in subsection G, "Appendix G - IDNR/OWR Dam Safety Permitting Guidelines",
of this section.
(2) All other state, federal, and SMC development located in the regulatory floodplain.
(3) Permit issuance for development within or over public waters.
b. For the following types of regulatory approvals or permit authority, SMC has jurisdiction within depressional flood prone areas with greater than
twenty (20) acres of tributary area and riverine flood prone areas with greater than one hundred (100) acres of tributary area. IDNR/OWR has
jurisdiction within regulatory floodways or floodplains with greater than six hundred forty (640) acres (1 square mile) of tributary area:
(1) Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist.
(2) Any changes in the base flood elevation.
(3) Changes to the regulatory floodway boundaries.
(4) Determination that the development is a public flood control project.
c. SMC has regulatory approval or permit authority for the following types of development:
(1) Noncertified community development.
(2) Public road development.
(3) Determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing proposed to be modified is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating
the proposed flood profile, per section 10-9-7-707, "Bridge, Culvert Crossing, And Roadway Approach Performance Standards", of this chapter.
(4) Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in subsection 10-9-7-703.04 of this chapter.
(5) Lake County forest preserve district development.
(6) Community and local unit of government development in the regulatory floodplain.
(7) Other development as specified within intergovernmental agreements with the SMC.
11. The enforcement officer shall submit the data required to SMC, IDNR/OWR, and the federal emergency management agency (FEMA) for proposed
revisions to the base flood elevation of a regulatory floodplain study or a relocation of a regulatory floodway boundary.
The enforcement officer shall submit reports as required for the national flood insurance program.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 472/522
12. The adopted Lake County comprehensive stormwater management plan states the SMC should "maintain a repository of stormwater management
data for the county". Toward that end, the enforcement officer shall:
a. Maintain records of every watershed development permit application, permit, variance, hydrologic and hydraulic data, and enforcement action and
shall allow periodic inspections of the records by SMC, FEMA, or IDNR/OWR personnel.
b. Maintain an elevation certificate and floodproofing certificate file, to certify the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or
nonresidential building or the elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, for buildings constructed in the regulatory
floodplain.
c. Maintain for public inspection and provide copies upon request of: base flood data and maps, variance documentation, conditional letters of map
revision, letters of map revision, letters of map amendment, elevation and floodproofing certificate, other watershed development permit related
materials, elevation and floodproofing record drawings for buildings requiring floodproofing or constructed subject to the elevation criteria
provisions of this chapter, and record drawings of the stormwater management system required by this chapter for each development.
d. Copy to the SMC, at agreed upon intervals, but no later than a five (5) year period, specified portions of the watershed development permit
records.
13. The enforcement officer shall notify adjacent upstream and downstream communities, the SMC, and IDNR/OWR in writing thirty (30) days prior to
the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of a channel in a regulatory floodplain.

M. Appendix M - SMC Approved Wetland Mitigation Banking Requirements:
1. Purpose: This subsection M includes the criteria for establishing, owning and operating wetland mitigation banks. It further sets out the criteria for
authorizing applicants (e.g., individuals, corporations, units of government) to withdraw credits from a mitigation bank to offset unavoidable wetland
impacts that would result from the applicant's proposed activity.
2. Goals: Mitigation banks are a form of regional mitigation, which encourage the development of large scale wetland complexes that can be
professionally managed and maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of the general public. The consolidation of multiple small mitigation projects
allows for economies of scale in planning, implementation, and maintenance, and can produce wetlands of greater value because of their size and a
high level of commitment to long term management. The expected benefits include water quality management, wildlife habitat restoration and
creation, flood control, conservation of biological diversity, education, recreation, and aesthetics. Further, this action will reduce administrative costs
and delays in issuing permits for proposed activities that qualify for use of a mitigation bank.
Mitigation banking is intended to be a means of creating or restoring wetlands and generating bank credits in advance of the filling of wetlands for
specific projects. As an interim measure, and as a way to encourage the initial development and implementation of banks, the sale of bank credits
and the issuance of permits prior to the generation of bank credits at the bank site shall be allowed under conditions described elsewhere in this
document.
3. Definitions:
CREATION: Conversion of a nonwetland site into a wetland site by excavation, diking and flooding, or conversion of a deep water site by filling.
CREDIT CERTIFICATION: A formal determination by the SMC that mitigation bank credits have been generated. Certified credits result from fully
meeting all certification standards (see subsection M15, "Credit Certification", of this section). Conditionally certified credits are those credits that are
based on reasonable progress toward becoming certified credits. Uncertified credits are those credits that are based on full approval of the bank
charter, and initial construction of the bank, including demonstration of wetland hydrology and planting. A maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the
total potential credits may be sold upon approval of bank charter alone. An additional twenty percent (20%) of the total credits may be sold upon the
demonstration of wetland hydrology. Upon completion of the approved planting plan, an additional twenty percent (20%) of the total credits may be
sold. Using this formula, seventy percent (70%) of the total credits available from the bank may be sold as uncertified credits.
DESIGNATED SERVICE AREA: The designated service area of an SMC approved mitigation bank is Lake County or that portion of the village of
Barrington within Cook County.
ENHANCEMENT: Altering the physical characteristics of an existing wetland such that it permanently improves one or more specific wetland
functions and values. Because impacts associated with individual projects that propose to use bank credits will, in virtually all cases, be permanent,
only enhancement that results in permanent improvement of a wetland's functions and values will generate credits.
GROWING SEASON: The period between May 1 and October 10. This growing season definition is for the purposes of this subsection M alone, and
is used to establish performance periods for determining compliance with revegetation standards. It does not establish the growing season for
purposes of wetland delineation.
LEDGER: Document to be used in the accounting of credits and debits. The ledger will be maintained by the bank sponsor and reviewed by the
SMC.
MANAGEMENT: Actions taken within mitigation bank wetlands to establish and maintain desired habitat conditions. Representative management
actions include water level manipulations, herbiciding, mechanical plant removal, and prescribed burning.
MITIGATION BANK: A system of accounting for wetland loss and compensation, which can include one or more wetland mitigation sites. The
minimum acreage requirements in this chapter shall apply to each site.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 479/522
MITIGATION BANK CHARTER: A written document which contains specifications pertaining to establishment, operation and maintenance of a
wetland mitigation bank, codification of the goals, objectives, procedures of the bank, and incorporating the relevant terms and conditions of this
chapter. Principal types of banking charters are a legally binding agreement or a watershed development permit.
MITIGATION BANK CREDITS: The unit of measure of bank credit will be acres by wetland type.
MITIGATION BANK SITE: The geographic location of created, restored, and enhanced wetlands, which serve as the physical resource used to
generate bank credits.
MONITORING: A specific program of data collection which documents the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the mitigation bank
wetlands, for the purpose of determining compliance with performance standards contained in the mitigation bank charter.
PHASED MITIGATION BANK: The construction of a mitigation bank in discrete steps, as authorized or agreed to in advance by the SMC. The bank
prospectus must clearly describe each phase of the bank, and list the order in which the phases would be constructed.
PROSPECTUS: A preliminary plan for a wetland mitigation bank prepared by a prospective sponsor and submitted for consideration to SMC.
RESTORATION: Reestablishing wetland conditions in areas that were wetland in historical times, but which have been modified such that they are
now considered nonwetland. Restoration converts previous wetland sites back to functional wetlands.
SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN: A plan for each bank site that identifies all actions that will be undertaken to generate bank credits. Representative
elements of the site development plan include plans for site grading, revegetation, erosion control, structures, management, and monitoring.
SPONSOR: The legally responsible individual or entity, proposing establishment of a wetland mitigation bank.
WETLAND MITIGATION: Replacement of wetlands, and wetlands functions and values, for the purposes of compensating for wetland impacts. The
replacement of the wetland functions and values is generally accomplished through wetland restoration, creation, and enhancement.
4. Reserved.
5. Considerations In Establishment And Use Of Mitigation Banks: Charters of mitigation banks, mitigation sites, and associated wetland credits shall be
subject to approval by the SMC. Every mitigation bank shall have as its primary purpose the creation, restoration, enhancement, and long term
protection and maintenance of wetland resources. All existing property rights remain in effect.
In all cases of a proposed bank, the SMC will issue a public notice describing the project. The public comment period for submittal of relevant
comments on the bank prospectus will be a minimum of thirty (30) days. The watershed development permit that is needed in order to construct,
restore, or enhance wetlands on the bank site will follow normal permit processing procedures.
Operation and maintenance procedures approved by the SMC shall be employed to maintain the wetland resources in the bank in as high a
qualitative state as is technically practicable. Management of the mitigation bank shall be based on a monitoring plan approved by the SMC.
Monitoring shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, monitoring of the water, soil, and plants comprising the wetland assets of the bank.
The bank sponsor shall strive to manage the assets to provide multiple wetland benefits such as water quality management, flood control, biological
conservation, and educational and recreational opportunities. In general, mitigation banks should be planned and designed such that little or no
management or maintenance other than prescribed burning is necessary once the plant communities are established.
6. General Guidelines: Using normal review procedures prescribed by this chapter, the SMC will conduct project evaluations and will determine the
level of mitigation required, and whether a project is eligible to use a mitigation bank.
a. Ideally, mitigation banks should be a way of restoring and creating wetlands in advance of development projects that result in wetland losses.
However, to promote the establishment of mitigation banks, this chapter provides for limited, incremental sales of uncertified credits, and for the
issuance of watershed development permits based on uncertified credits according to the guidelines found in subsection M16, "Mitigation Bank
Credit Sales", of this section. This provision is considered necessary to increase the economic viability of mitigation banks. Because the
development plan for any given bank site may require the sale of a minimum number of credits before wetlands may be restored or constructed, it
is recognized that a temporary deficit of wetlands may result. To address this possibility, the SMC will require a higher mitigation ratio for the use of
uncertified and conditionally certified credit, and for funds to be maintained in an appropriate financial security to ensure construction of the bank's
wetlands. This chapter also limits the number of credits that can be sold prior to construction, and prior to conditional certification. It also
establishes a maximum amount of time that may elapse before preconstruction credit sales are converted to conditionally certified or fully certified
credits.
b. Emphasis will be on the replacement of wetland acreage and type. Therefore, the preferred method of generating wetland bank credits will be the
restoration of former wetlands or the creation of new wetlands, which will result in a net gain in wetland acreage on the bank site. Permanent
wetland enhancement as a means of generating bank credits can be performed as specified in subsection M14, "Establishing Mitigation Bank
Credits", of this section. Appropriate functional value assessment methodologies and credit ratios will be determined for each site by the SMC.
c. Mitigation banks generally shall be held to a higher standard of performance than conventional wetland mitigation sites. These standards are
detailed in subsection M19, "Performance Standards", of this section.
d. Permit applications for wetland impacts to high quality aquatic resources generally will not be considered for mitigation banking, until the applicant
has shown compliance with the avoidance and minimization requirements of this chapter.
e. The mitigation bank, once established, must be dedicated to maintaining the wetland functions and values to the exclusion of other conflicting
uses, as determined by the SMC.
7. Site Selection Criteria: The bank site will be reviewed with respect to the following site selection criteria. Failure to meet any of these criteria may be,
depending on circumstances, grounds for rejection of a bank site. The site shall:
a. Be owned and/or under the full control of the bank.
b. Contain a majority of drained or hydrologically modified hydric soils, recognizing that restoration of former wetlands is a preferred form of
mitigation.
c. Have no high quality aquatic resources that would be adversely affected by the construction or restoration work.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 480/522
d. Contain adequate perimeter upland areas to buffer the wetlands from potentially incompatible land uses on adjoining parcels and meet the buffer
requirements of this chapter.
e. Be so situated that adequate hydrology can be ensured (e.g., be located on a floodplain or possess a high groundwater table).
f. Be proximate or adjacent to public land holdings so as to create contiguous, large scale habitat areas.
g. Be part of an adopted or accepted open space plan, watershed plan, conservancy district, protected riparian corridor, or other local or regional
conservation land use plan. This criterion has been established in order to help implement local and regional conservation plans, and to ensure
maximum consistency and compatibility with future surrounding land uses.
h. Contain no known hazardous waste, which must be confirmed by an environmental assessment conducted by a qualified person or firm.
i. Have a minimum size of ten (10) acres or five (5) acres if within the Lake Michigan watershed.
8. Bank Ownership: A mitigation bank may be either publicly or privately owned. The bank may be incorporated as for profit or not for profit. If the bank
is incorporated, it must be incorporated in the state of Illinois. Publicly owned refers to ownership of the bank site by any federal, state, regional, or
local unit of government.
All land, including associated uplands, which are part of the mitigation bank shall be protected in perpetuity from future development by an
appropriate deed or plat restriction. This deed or plat restriction must be recorded with the recorder of deeds office, attached to the abstract of title,
with a certified copy of the registration provided to the SMC prior to the SMC authorizing the bank. The mitigation bank charter should also identify
the entity responsible for the ownership and long term management of the site. In addition, the bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate
funds for the operation and maintenance of the bank during its operational life, as well as for long term management of the site. Bank sponsors are
strongly encouraged to establish agreements for long term management with public or private conservation organizations.
Transfer or sale of the mitigation bank may occur to a party willing and financially able to abide by the terms and conditions of the mitigation bank
charter entered into by the SMC and the bank owner. Any such transfer must be approved by the SMC.
9. Initial Planning: The individual or entity proposing to sponsor establishment of a mitigation bank will initially hold informal discussions with the SMC.
The purpose of these discussions will be to acquaint the sponsor with the legal, regulatory, and ecological background relevant to banking and to
provide procedural guidance to the prospective applicant.
During this discussion the prospective bank sponsor will be informed that a formal request for the establishment of a bank must be made to the SMC.
The formal request will include a prospectus and a watershed development permit application, if required. The bank sponsor and the SMC shall
develop an authorizing document for the bank that shall be signed by all parties. The authorizing document should outline the responsibilities of the
bank sponsor, and contain the necessary information outlined in this chapter governing the operation of the bank.
10. Prospectus Development: The purpose of the prospectus is to provide sufficient information to allow the SMC to determine if the general
considerations and site evaluation criteria outlined in this chapter are likely to be met if the proposed bank is established. It is understood that the
prospectus will become the basis of the mitigation bank charter. The prospectus should contain:
a. The bank location and size;
b. A delineation of any wetlands or other jurisdictional areas that may exist at the proposed bank location;
c. The type of real estate interest in bank property;
d. A legal description of the property;
e. The type of bank (i.e., single client, general use, market oriented, etc.);
f. The method of credit production (i.e., restoration, creation, enhancement), the number of proposed credits by each method, and the rationale for
crediting;
g. A statement as to compliance with this document;
h. A general site plan showing the location of all existing and proposed wetland and upland habitats, roads, trails, structures, utilities, and any other
existing or proposed site improvements;
i. An outline of management and maintenance responsibilities;
j. A preliminary construction plan and schedule of completion, preliminary planting plan, and preliminary administrative, management, monitoring,
and financial plans; and
k. A charter of incorporation for the mitigation bank, if appropriate.
11. Financial Assurances: The bank sponsor is responsible for securing sufficient funds or other financial assurances to cover contingency actions in
the event of bank default or failure. In addition, the bank sponsor is responsible for securing adequate funding to monitor and maintain the bank
throughout its operational life, and to make provision for long term management through financial assurances or through agreements with land
management organizations or agencies. Total funding requirements should reflect realistic cost estimates for monitoring, long term maintenance,
contingency and remedial actions. Financial assurances may be in the form of performance bonds, irrevocable letters of credit, irrevocable trusts,
escrow accounts, casualty insurance, or other approved sureties. Such assurances may be phased out or reduced once it has been demonstrated
that the bank is functionally mature and/or self-sustaining in accordance with the approved performance standards. The financial plan must
demonstrate that the bank and its wetlands can be maintained in perpetuity whether through continual ownership or by conveyance to a public or
private agency that will assume the responsibilities of the bank.
12. Mitigation Bank Application Process: The sponsor must submit a watershed development permit application and a prospectus for the initial
development of the bank. Upon receipt of these items the SMC shall begin a public interest review on the prospectus with input from government
agencies and the general public. The public will be notified of all proposed banks by a public notice issued by the SMC for a thirty (30) day comment
period. Copies of all comments received during the public notice comment period will be given to the bank sponsor. Full consideration will be given to
all comments received in evaluating the bank proposal. The bank sponsor and the SMC shall develop an authorizing document for the bank. The
authorizing document should outline the responsibilities of the bank sponsor, and contain the necessary information outlined in this chapter
governing the operation of the bank. Additionally, the details of the bank sponsor's responsibilities shall be noted in any watershed development
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 481/522
permit in which the permittee's mitigation responsibilities are met through the use of the mitigation bank.
SMC shall make a site inspection of the bank area. A written response to the banking prospectus indicating the prospective bank's feasibility would
then be prepared by the SMC based upon observations made during the site visit. An indication of feasibility in the letter should be interpreted as
general acceptability of conceptual bank plans and either probable issuance of a watershed development permit, or probable signatory approval of a
mitigation bank charter upon completion of detailed plans.
The formal request to the SMC for establishment of a bank shall include:
a. A watershed development permit application to conduct the proposed work that is necessary to establish the bank;
b. A copy of the previously described prospectus; and
c. A plan that details the goals, objectives, and success criteria for creating wetlands, including wetland types and their respective acreages.
13. Detailed Planning Stage: This is the final planning stage leading to issuance of a watershed development permit for authorization, implementation,
and operation of a bank. The preparation of detailed plans should be closely coordinated with the SMC and other local authorities as appropriate.
Each mitigation bank shall have a site development plan that must be approved by the SMC. This plan shall identify and incorporate the following, to
the extent practicable and appropriate:
a. Diverse aquatic and supporting landscapes (e.g., shallow open water, riparian wetlands, deep and shallow marshes, floodplain forests, wet
meadows and prairies, upland buffers, etc.), which are interrelated, one to the other, so as to maximize wetland functions and values;
b. Diverse wildlife habitats and associated edge conditions;
c. Associated upland buffer areas contiguous to the wetlands to protect the wetlands from potential adverse effects of adjacent land uses, specifying
the width and area of all such zones;
d. Wetland functions which will be created or enhanced by maximizing vegetative diversity and abundance, structuring specific wildlife habitats,
optimizing wetland hydrology, and providing public access;
e. Species native to the area;
f. The use of native soils on the site;
g. The means for establishing the appropriate hydrology; and
h. The mitigation bank shall be designed to be as self-sufficient as possible and minimize maintenance.
14. Establishing Mitigation Bank Credits: The units of wetland credit shall be acres of wetland. Mitigation bank credits shall be generated as wetlands
are created, restored, or enhanced on the bank site, resulting in an increase in wetland acreage and/or quality on the bank site. Banking credits may
be generated as follows: Full credit will be given for wetland creation from upland and for restoration of former wetlands. Partial credit (25 percent of
the enhanced wetland acreage) can be given for permanent enhancement (e.g., reestablishment of hydrology) of degraded wetlands. A maximum of
thirty percent (30%) of the total potential credits generated by the bank may consist of enhanced wetlands or enhanced uplands.
15. Credit Certification: Mitigation bank credits shall be certifiable by the SMC when the bank credits conform to the criteria outlined in subsection M19,
"Performance Standards", of this section. Credits may be certifiable at any time, but the standards for certification shall be met no later than five (5)
years from the date of planting unless otherwise specified in the bank charter and approved by the SMC. After the second full growing season
following creation or restoration of wetlands, the SMC may conditionally certify the credits of the bank based on reasonable progress toward
achieving the performance standards. Conditional certification shall be based on degree of conformance with the standards for conditional
certification in subsection M19, "Performance Standards", of this section, and on any interim corrective measures recommended by the SMC.
At the end of five (5) years, if any of the above conditions are not met, the authorized agent of the bank shall submit a plan to the SMC outlining
corrective measures to be taken based on the ecological conditions of the site. Management activities shall continue until the standards are met, as
verified by the SMC.
Certain types of enhancement of existing wetland can be an acceptable way of generating credits if the enhancement actions are scientifically sound
and result in a substantial, measurable, and permanent increase in the level of wetland function. The types of enhancement that will be acceptable
include the following:
a. Restoration of wetland hydrology at sites that have been significantly modified through tile drainage or ditch drainage.
b. Restoration of diverse native plant communities where the original plant community has been totally destroyed, and the site is currently farmed or
has revegetated with aggressive and/or exotic species such as reed canary grass, cattails, purple loosestrife, phragmites, buckthorn, or other
species. Restoration goals would include the removal of the exotic or aggressive species, and the introduction and establishment of a diverse
assemblage of native species appropriate for the site considering geographic location, soils, hydrology, and other factors. Selective removal of
exotic species in otherwise healthy native plant communities will normally not be considered eligible for credit.
c. Restoration of deep marsh habitat through shallow impoundment, where the purpose is to create hemimarsh conditions suitable for nesting by
target wetland bird species of concern. This approach is appropriate at sites that have been significantly altered through partial drainage, and
consist largely of dense monotypic stands of cattails or other aggressive species. It is not appropriate for sites that have existing biodiversity or
habitat values that would be adversely affected by the proposed actions or where the level of benefit would be minimal.
The prospectus must specifically state which aspects of wetland function would be increased as a result of the enhancement actions, the level to
which they would be increased, and the scientific basis for expecting the increase. It must also include a narrative description of how the
enhancement would be accomplished, a schedule of completion, explicit performance standards, and performance milestones for enhancement
actions to be carried out over an extended period of time.
Performance standards for enhancement work will be approved as part of the watershed development permit. Actions such as the restoration of
hydrology can be implemented in a very short time, and can be measured through immediate water level responses. Plant community restoration
is a lengthier process, requiring sustained effort over a period of time. In such cases, interim performance milestones may be established, and
credits resulting from such work would be included in the final thirty percent (30%) increment of credit released from the bank.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 482/522
Credit ratios will be determined based on specific circumstances for each bank. Restoration of a historic wetland area or creation of a wetland from
an upland area would receive a credit ratio of one hundred percent (100%). Actions that restore a very degraded wetland to a high degree of
function, such as restoring normal hydrology to a drained wetland, or restoring a high level of species diversity to a monotypic plant community,
shall receive credit at a maximum ratio of twenty five percent (25%) of the credit values awarded to restored or created wetlands.
All created, restored, or enhanced wetland areas on the mitigation bank site shall, at a minimum, meet the buffer width requirements of subsection
10-9-5-505.01 of this chapter. All existing high quality aquatic resources on the mitigation bank site shall, at a minimum, meet the buffer width
requirements of subsection 10-9-5-505.01 of this chapter.
The inclusion of upland and deep water environments within a wetland mitigation bank may be inadvertent (i.e., due to topographic reasons and
real estate considerations) or planned (i.e., to realize or enhance certain wetland functions). In the latter case, upland areas may be either naturally
occurring or be artificially created and, depending on their basic purpose, may occur along the periphery of the bank or be dispersed throughout.
Enhanced upland areas or enhanced wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements of this chapter for the mitigation bank shall be credited
at twenty five percent (25%) of the enhanced acreage completed. Created or restored wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements of this
chapter for the mitigation bank shall be credited at seventy five percent (75%) of the acreage created or restored.
Conditional certification will allow for a reduction of the posted financial security to a level sufficient to assure full certification. Corrective measures
will be approved by the SMC prior to implementation. These measures should ensure that the mitigation standard is met at the end of the five (5)
year management period from the day the planting is completed.
During construction of the mitigation wetlands, qualified personnel must make periodic inspections of the site to ensure that soil erosion control
measures are employed and functioning properly. Inspection reports shall be submitted to the SMC on a monthly basis.
16. Mitigation Bank Credit Sales: Upon authorization of the mitigation bank, through a watershed development permit, the sale of wetland credits and
the creation or restoration of wetlands and buffers may commence. The mitigation bank credits may be sold for mitigation purposes in accordance
with the following conditions:
a. Certified credits and conditionally certified credits may be sold provided that adequate funds, as approved by the SMC, are established through an
escrow account, performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial surety for the generation of certified credits and long term
maintenance of the bank site.
b. If an approved bank has only uncertified credits, then those uncertified credits may be sold for mitigation purposes, provided that adequate funds,
as approved by the SMC, are established through an escrow account, performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial surety for
the generation of credits and long term maintenance of the required bank site.
c. The SMC has sole authority to determine the number of credits available for withdrawal from the mitigation bank.
d. All mitigation bank credit sales shall require prior approval by the SMC to confirm credit availability and compliance with all other provisions of this
chapter.
In every event, the mitigation bank sponsor shall establish in a performance bond, escrow account, irrevocable letter of credit, or other financial
surety, adequate funds to ensure the construction, planting, and long term monitoring, management, and maintenance of the mitigation bank
wetlands and associated uplands. The amount of the financial surety shall be based upon the calculated per acre cost of completing the approved
plan, including grading and planting of the site. Cost estimates for the construction and/or planting and maintenance for all restored, created, or
enhanced wetlands in the bank must be presented. A proposed schedule of release of the financial surety following completion of specific tasks
associated with the establishment of the bank must also be submitted for approval. Construction estimates shall include an estimate of the cubic
yards of earth to be moved during the grading of the site, as well as an estimated cost per cubic yard for the earthwork.
The interest on all such escrow accounts may be used by the bank sponsor for monitoring, management, and maintenance purposes only. The
financial sureties must be maintained until all credits have been certified and sold or the SMC has determined the mitigation bank is selfsustaining.
The amount of the financial surety will be reviewed annually based on the results of the monitoring report.
For all mitigation banks, credit sales may commence upon approval of the bank's charter. A maximum of thirty percent (30%) of the total potential
credits may be sold prior to construction, based on approval of the bank's charter and the posting of adequate financial surety. Upon acceptance
by the SMC that appropriate wetland hydrology has been demonstrated throughout all proposed wetlands at the site, an additional twenty percent
(20%) of the total credits may be sold. Upon acceptance by the SMC that the site has been planted according to the approved plan, and after
wetland hydrology has been demonstrated, another twenty percent (20%) of the total credits may be sold. The final thirty percent (30%) of the total
credits may be sold upon full certification.
Incremental demonstration of wetland hydrology, and incremental planting of the site may also be awarded credit. For example, piezometer data
from a fifty (50) acre wetland restoration area shows that thirty seven (37) acres of the planned wetland meets the wetland hydrology criterion of
the 1987 "Federal Wetland Delineation Manual" (as amended, including applicable supplements).
These thirty seven (37) acres represent seventy four percent (74%) of the proposed wetland area. By applying this seventy four percent (74%)
factor to the allowable twenty percent (20%) increment of credits awarded for demonstrating wetland hydrology, the allowable increment of new
credits for the bank would equal 14.8 percent of the proposed wetland on the site (0.74 x .20 = 0.148, or 14.8%). The same method would be used
for calculating credits due to incremental planting. In the event that the bank sponsor sells more than the number of credits approved by the SMC,
the SMC reserves the right to deduct the amount of the oversale from the total potential credits available from the bank. These credits will not be
restored, even if future development of the bank results in the certification of additional credit sales.
No watershed development permits will be granted to applicants proposing to use a mitigation bank unless credits are available in the bank, as
specified in this chapter.
The initial physical and biological improvements at the bank site (including, but not limited to, grading, planting, and restoration of wetland
hydrology) must be completed no later than the end of the third full growing season following the sale of the first mitigation bank credit.
The bank sponsor shall keep a ledger of all available credits, whether purchased or unpurchased, and of all credits sold or otherwise debited
including individual sale prices. This ledger shall be made available to the SMC upon request. In addition, the bank sponsor must provide the SMC
an updated ledger containing a list of all transactions, including sale prices at a given bank to date at the conclusion of every credit sale.

17. Monitoring, Management, And Reporting: Monitoring shall occur for a period of five (5) years from the date of the completion of the approved
planting plan. Management shall proceed on a continuing basis from the completion of planting through the end of the monitoring period.
Management shall proceed as needed to reconcile current conditions with functional goals. Any required remedial measures will be based on
information contained in monitoring reports and/or from SMC site inspections.
The monitoring results of the mitigation bank shall be provided to the SMC on an annual basis during the monitoring period. Following this, no report
shall be required, but the SMC shall retain the right to inspect the mitigation bank as deemed appropriate. The SMC shall hold on file copies of any
reports. The SMC will establish an annual compliance monitoring schedule that assures that all mitigation bank sites are inspected for compliance
with the approved bank plan.
The mitigation bank sponsor shall be responsible for all monitoring, management, and reporting. However, the work may be done by bank
employees, subcontractors, or public or private organizations.
The operational life of a bank shall consist of the period during which the terms and conditions of the mitigation bank charter are in effect. With the
exception of arrangements for the long term management and protection in perpetuity of the wetlands and/or other aquatic resources and associated
uplands, the operational life of a mitigation bank terminates at the point when:
a. Wetland mitigation credits have been exhausted or banking activity is voluntarily terminated with written notice from the bank sponsor to the SMC;
or
b. The SMC has determined that the debited bank is functionally mature and/or self-sustaining to the degree specified in the mitigation bank charter
and associated documents, including the performance standards outlined in this chapter.
18. Loss Of Bank Charter: Should a bank not meet the terms of its charter, for whatever reason, the SMC shall inform the bank sponsor and shall
specify a reasonable period of time in which to comply. Should any modifications to the charter be required, recommended changes shall be
approved by the SMC. Continued nonperformance of the bank shall result in revocation of the charter and forfeiture of financial securities.
19. Performance Standards: The following performance standards are established to ensure that mitigation banks create wetlands, which compare
favorably with moderate to high quality natural wetlands with respect to diversity, abundance, and distribution of plant species, and also to ensure
that the created wetlands exhibit the hydrologic regimes of natural wetlands. These standards will be used to measure the performance of mitigation
banks unless otherwise stated in the mitigation bank charter. The bank sponsor may propose other standards if native plant restoration is not the
primary goal of the mitigation bank. For example, wildlife habitat enhancement goals may require the development of alternative standards based on
habitat structure such as the interspersion of open water and cattails, or the seasonal establishment of mud flats. Justification for alternative
standards must be provided in the bank prospectus. The SMC retains approval authority for any performance standards proposed which are different
from those contained in this chapter.
a. Species Composition: Species selected for the planting shall be native to Lake County (ref. Swink and Wilhelm, "Plants Of The Chicago Region",
4th edition, 1994), and shall be appropriate for the hydrologic zone to be planted. A minimum number of native perennial species proposed for
establishment must be present within each plant community to meet certification standards, as follows:
Marsh: minimum of fifteen (15) native perennial species
Mesic prairie (buffer): minimum of twenty five (25) native perennial species
Sedge meadow/wet prairie: minimum of thirty five (35) native perennial species
In addition, at least fifty percent (50%) of the required minimum number of species must occur at a ten percent (10%) frequency or greater.
b. Species Dominance: The following dominance standards are for wetland mitigation banking purposes only. Dominance shall be determined by
calculating importance values, with at least two (2) parameters, frequency and cover, used to calculate species importance. Cattails (Typha spp.),
reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and nonnative species shall cumulatively comprise not more than five percent (5%) of the total
dominance measure for each community for which credit is granted.
The native perennial species within each wetland plant community shall represent at least eighty percent (80%) of the total dominance measure.
c. Wetland Hydrology: Wetland hydrology must be independently demonstrated within each wetland for which credit is sought from data gathered
from piezometers placed throughout the bank site. Piezometer placement must be approved by the SMC prior to approval of the bank.
d. Conditional Certification: Credits shall be conditionally certified not sooner than the second full growing season after planting, based upon
achieving the following standards:
Seventy five percent (75%) of the minimum number of native perennial species required for full certification shall be present in each plant
community.
The total of native perennial species within each plant community shall represent at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total dominance measure.
N. Appendix N - WDO Mitigation Requirements And Guidelines For Isolated Waters Of Lake County And Isolated Waters Of Barrington Impacts: This
subsection N contains the minimum requirements and guidelines for preparation of a project mitigation document (PMD) related to the creation or
enhancement of wetlands on a development site, or on an off site property, to meet the mitigation provisions in section 10-9-10-1007, "Mitigation For
Isolated Waters Of Lake County And For Isolated Waters Of Barrington", of this chapter. These provisions do not apply for category IV (subsection 10-
9-10-1005.01A4 of this chapter) impacts to isolated waters of Lake County. The PMD shall provide, at a minimum, information needed by SMC or an
isolated wetland certified community (IWCC) to evaluate the appropriateness and enforceability of a proposed mitigation plan. Additional requirements
may apply for impacts to waters of the United States, as determined by the U.S. army corps of engineers. For the purposes of this subsection N, the
term mitigation site refers to the ownership parcel where the mitigation is to occur. Mitigation area refers to the location within the mitigation site where
the actual mitigation will occur.
Each PMD shall include specific information in a standard format as outlined in table 1 of this section and described in subsections N1 through N11 of
this section.

1. Mitigation Goals:
a. Discuss how the wetland mitigation shall duplicate or improve the hydrologic and biologic features of the impacted wetlands. Describe the specific
functions of the wetlands to be created or enhanced versus the functions of the wetlands to be impacted.
b. Describe the acreage and vegetative community type of wetlands and wetland buffers to be created or enhanced to meet the minimum mitigation
ratios required in subsection 10-9-10-1007.02 of this chapter. Mitigation acreage shall be credited on the following basis:
(1) One hundred percent (100%) for each acre of wetland created or restored. For the purposes of this subsection N, wetland creation includes
restoration of historic wetlands which have been filled, drained, or otherwise manipulated to the extent the areas no longer exhibit wetland
characteristics. Open water creation shall be credited at one hundred percent (100%) for in-kind mitigation (e.g., 1 acre of open water created for
1 acre of open water impacted). No mitigation credit shall be given for open water creation to compensate for nonopen water impacts.
(2) Twenty five percent (25%) for each acre of nonfarmed wetland enhanced after a minimum ratio of one to one (1:1) for wetland creation to
wetland impact is achieved.
(3) Enhancement of farmed wetlands meeting the size criterion in subsection 10-9-10-1007.03A of this chapter may be used for up to eighty
percent (80%) of the total mitigation requirement (e.g., if 2.0 acres of mitigation are required, up to 1.6 acres may be credited for farmed wetland
enhancement, as long as the size criterion above is met).
(4) Enhanced upland areas or enhanced wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements in section 10-9-5-505, "Buffer Areas", of this chapter
shall be credited at twenty five percent (25%) for each acre enhanced. Created or restored wetland edges used to meet the buffer requirements
of this chapter shall be credited at seventy five percent (75%) for each acre created or restored. All high quality aquatic resources existing on the
mitigation site shall, at a minimum, meet the buffer requirements for high quality aquatic resources; all other existing enhanced, created or
restored wetland areas shall, at a minimum, meet the non-high quality aquatic resource buffer requirements of this chapter.
2. Mitigation Site Information:
a. Site Location: Identify the mitigation site on a general location map (USGS quadrangle map preferred), plat of survey, and major watershed map
(e.g., Fox River watershed).

hundred feet (1" = 100') showing the existing land use(s) and pertinent features, such as buildings, roads, utility lines, drain tiles, culverts,
landscaping, lot lines, etc. Include on the plan or provide a narrative of any adjacent land uses that could conflict with the mitigation proposal and
any zoning restrictions. Discuss potential adverse impacts to the mitigation site, including stormwater runoff from adjacent properties or nearby
development in the watershed. Include a copy of the current zoning map and comprehensive land plan showing proposed land use(s), roads, and
trail systems.
d. Ownership: Identify the current owner(s) of the mitigation site property. If the owner is different from the permittee, provide the SMC or IWCC with
a copy of an executed agreement between the owner(s) and permittee that grants permission by the owner(s) for the permittee to use the property
for mitigation and specifies the responsibilities of each party for establishment of the mitigation site. Once mitigation is in place, the permittee shall
notify the SMC or IWCC of any change in ownership. The new owner(s) shall provide written assurance to the issuer of the watershed
development permit of the transfer of the permit and intent to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit, specifically the mitigation plan.
e. Significant Biological Resources: The permittee shall consult with the Illinois department of natural resources (IDNR) and the U.S. fish and wildlife
service (USFWS) regarding the possible presence of threatened or endangered species or critical habitat on the mitigation site. The SMC or IWCC
shall not approve the mitigation area until documentation is provided confirming the proposed mitigation area is in compliance with the IDNR's
endangered species consultation program1 and the Illinois natural areas preservation act2 and the USFWS' consultation program under the
federal endangered species act.
3. Mitigation Design:

and proposed grades with a minimum of one foot (1') contour lines. Identify elevation and location of reference bench marks. Include cross
sections for the mitigation wetlands with normal water level (NWL) and high water level (HWL) depicted, if applicable.
b. Hydrology: Identify the source(s) of water for the mitigation wetlands, both surface and subsurface. Describe any water control structures to be
used and identify these structures on the grading plan, with invert elevations. Control structures with adjustable inverts are recommended to
facilitate management of desired water levels in the mitigation wetlands. Describe the expected hydrologic regime of the mitigation wetlands.
Provide hydrologic modeling results in both summary table and hydrograph form for the 2-year and 100-year, 24-hour storm events, at a minimum,
to support the expected hydrologic regime of the mitigation wetlands. Verify that the mitigation design will not adversely impact the hydrology of
existing on site or nearby wetlands.
Discuss factors influencing the quality of stormwater runoff from on site and off site sources (e.g., roads, lawns, parking lots, etc.) and incorporate
best management practices (BMPs) into the design to treat runoff before it discharges into the wetlands. Identify the BMPs on the grading plan.
Stormwater detention basins shall not be used for creation of wetlands to meet the wetland mitigation requirements in section 10-9-10-1007,
"Mitigation For Isolated Waters Of Lake County And For Isolated Waters Of Barrington", of this chapter.
c. Soils: A minimum of twelve inches (12") of suitable rooting medium shall be provided on the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffer areas. Use low
ground pressure equipment to minimize soil compaction. Include information about whether topsoil will be imported from off site.
If the mitigation site contains a drained hydric soil, include the SCS soil map unit description and describe the drainage system (e.g., drain tile,
ditches, channels, etc.). The drainage system shall be shown on the grading plan. Verify the hydric soil map unit by digging a thirty inch (30") deep
soil pit in a representative location of the map unit and write a detailed profile description of the soil, including horizons, soil colors using Munsell
color charts, and soil texture and structure. Examine the soil profile for the presence of redoximorphic features such as iron/manganese
accumulations, oxidized rhizospheres, mottles, and depleted zones. Record the type, relative abundance, location, and color of these features.
Record other evidence of soil wetness such as the accumulation of partially decomposed organic matter at the soil surface.
d. Planting Plan: Submit a plan at a minimum scale of one inch equals one hundred feet (1" = 100') depicting the location and acreage of each
wetland and wetland buffer community type to be established. This plan shall also be used as the base map to show the locations of the
vegetation monitoring transects and hydrology sampling points discussed in this subsection N. Provide the list of plants to be established in
community by common and scientific name, along with the seeding or planting rate for each species. Seed and plant stock source(s) shall
originate from within one hundred fifty (150) miles of the mitigation site to maintain local genotypes.
4. Deed Or Plat Restriction: All mitigation wetlands, as well as other preserved wetlands or waters and wetland buffers on the mitigation site, shall be
protected in perpetuity by a deed or plat restriction. The permittee shall provide the SMC or IWCC with a draft copy of the proposed deed or plat
restriction document and associated exhibit(s) showing the restricted areas for approval. Contact the SMC for example wetland and wetland buffer
restrictive language.
5. Construction Schedule: Provide a schedule with anticipated start date and duration for each phase of the mitigation site construction, including
installation of soil erosion and sediment control measures, earthwork, and planting.
6. Financial Assurance: The permittee shall provide the SMC or IWCC with a financial surety for one hundred ten percent (110%) of the total estimated
cost for construction, monitoring, and management of the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers. The amount of the financial surety shall be based
upon the wetland consultant's detailed cost estimate for completing the approved mitigation plan, including earthwork, planting, and monitoring and
management for a minimum of five (5) full growing seasons after planting is completed. The cost estimate shall be provided to the SMC or IWCC for
approval prior to obtaining the financial surety. The financial surety may be in the form of a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, irrevocable
trust, escrow account, casualty insurance, or other approved surety.
The financial surety shall be held by the SMC or IWCC until the mitigation site meets the performance standards in subsection N8, "Performance
Standards", of this section. Such surety may be phased out or reduced by the SMC or IWCC once it has been demonstrated that the mitigation site
is functionally mature and/or self-sustaining in accordance with the performance standards in subsection N8, "Performance Standards", of this
section.
7. As Built Plans:
a. Upon the completion of earthwork, but prior to planting, the permittee shall provide an as built topographic map to the SMC or IWCC for approval.
The as built map shall depict the constructed grades at a minimum of two foot (2') contour intervals, along with spot elevations, and the invert
elevations of all water control structures. The bench mark(s) used to establish the grades shall also be indicated on the plan. If the constructed
grades and invert elevations are not in conformance with the approved grading and utility plan, the permittee shall be responsible for regrading or
reinstalling the water control structures at the designed elevations to comply with the approved plan. If the as built plan and site inspection are
determined to be in conformance with the approved design, the SMC or IWCC shall issue a written approval of the as built plan and planting
activities may commence.
b. Upon the completion of planting activities, the permittee shall provide the SMC or IWCC with lists of the species actually planted in the mitigation
wetlands and wetland buffers, including the common and scientific name of each species, the quantity of each species planted (e.g., weight of
seeds/acre, number of plugged plants/acre), the source of the seeds/plants, the planting method(s) used, and the date(s) seeding or planting
occurred.
8. Performance Standards: Performance standards are predetermined goals for guiding and measuring mitigation success.
a. Performance Period: The performance period shall consist of a minimum five (5) years at which time the vegetation performance standards are
met, unless the vegetation performance standards can be met earlier for two (2) consecutive growing seasons, at which time the performance
period shall be considered complete. Conversely, the performance period may be required to be longer than five (5) years in order to meet the
vegetation performance standards if they have not been met after the standard five (5) year time frame.
b. Wetland Vegetation Performance Standards: The performance standards below apply to emergent, wet prairie and sedge meadow communities. If
other community types are proposed (e.g., aquatic, forest, etc.), the permittee shall submit proposed performance standards for each community
to the SMC or IWCC for approval.
(1) Floristic Quality: By the end of the performance period, a native mean coefficient of conservatism value (native mean C value) of greater than
or equal to 3.5 and a native floristic quality index value (FQI) of greater than or equal to 20 shall be achieved for each wetland community. Native
plant species coefficients of conservatism and the methods for calculating the native mean C value and FQI are included in Floyd Swink and
Gerould Wilhelm, "Plants Of The Chicago Region" (Indianapolis: Indiana Academy Of Science, 4th edition, 1994).

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 486/522
(2) Mean Wetness Coefficient: By the end of the performance period, the mean wetness coefficient (mean W) shall be less than or equal to zero in
each wetland community. Wetness coefficients are listed below, based on the national wetland category of each plant species designated in
Reed, Porter B., "National List Of Plant Species That Occur In Wetlands: North Central (Region 3)", U.S. fish wildlife service, Rep. 88 (26.3,
1988). The mean W for each wetland community is calculated by the following equation: Sum of wetness coefficients for all species/number of
species.
WETNESS COEFFICIENTS
National Wetland Category Wetness Coefficient
Obligate (OBL) -5
Facultative wetland + (FACW+) -4
Facultative wetland (FACW) -3

Facultative upland - (FACU-) 2
Facultative upland (FACU) 3
Facultative upland + (FACU+) 4
Upland (UPL) 5
(3) Vegetative Cover: By the end of the performance period, no area greater than one hundred (100) square feet within the created or enhanced
wetlands shall be devoid of vegetation, as measured by percent area coverage. Areas not meeting this standard shall be replanted.

or sedge meadow communities shall be nonnative or weedy species, including, but not limited to, the following species: Typha spp., Phragmites
australis, Poa compressa, Poa pratensis, Lythrum salicaria, Salix interior, Echinochloa crusgalli, or Phalaris arundinacea. Dominance shall be
based on the relative importance value (RIV) of each species, which is calculated by the following equation:
RIVs = [RFs + RCs]/2 x 100, where:
RIVs is the relative importance value of the individual species in the community,
RFs is the frequency of the individual species occurring in all quadrats/the total frequency of all species (adventive and native) occurring in all
quadrats, and
RCs is the coverage of the individual species occurring in all quadrats/the total coverage of all species (adventive and native) occurring in all
quadrats.
c. Wetland Buffer Vegetation Performance Standards: The performance standards below apply to the prairie community to achieve mitigation credit.
If other community types are proposed for the wetland buffers (e.g., forest, savanna, etc.), the permittee shall submit proposed performance
standards for each community to the SMC or IWCC for approval.
(1) Floristic Quality: By the end of the performance period, a native mean coefficient of conservatism value (native mean C value) of greater than
or equal to 2.5 and a native floristic quality index value (FQI) of greater than or equal to 15 shall be achieved for the buffer.
(2) Vegetative Cover: By the end of the performance period, no area greater than one hundred (100) square feet within the created or enhanced
mesic prairie buffers shall be devoid of vegetation, as measured by percent area coverage. Areas not meeting this standard shall be replanted.
(3) Invasive Species Dominance: By the end of the performance period, none of the three (3) dominant plant species in the mesic prairie buffer
community shall be nonnative or weedy species, including, but not limited to, the following species: Cirsium arvense, Melilotus spp., Alliaria
petiolata, Poa compressa, Poa pratensis, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, or Rhamnus cathartica and R. frangula. Dominance shall be based on the
relative importance value (RIV) of each species, which is calculated using the equation in subsection N8b(4) of this section.
9. Monitoring And Management:
a. Monitoring:
(1) Monitoring Plan: The PMD shall contain a proposed five (5) year monitoring plan. Such plan shall include, at a minimum, a description of the
sampling methodologies to be followed for evaluating hydrology in the mitigation wetlands and assessing vegetation in the mitigation wetlands
and buffers, the frequency of sampling, and the report(s) to be generated.
(2) Vegetation Monitoring: A sufficient number of straight line sampling transects shall be established in the mitigation wetlands and wetland
buffers to achieve a representative amount of plant frequency and coverage data. The beginning and end points of each transect shall be
monumented in the field with a metal stake. The location of each transect and the number of proposed quadrats per transect shall be accurately
identified on the planting plan (subsection N3d of this section), which shall be included in the annual monitoring reports. Each transect shall
consist of a series of sample quadrats either 0.25 or 1.0 square meter in size. Vegetation sampling shall be conducted by, or under the
supervision of, a certified wetland specialist twice during the growing season with at least one month between sampling dates (e.g., May/June

of the transect at the time of sampling,
(B) Calculate the native mean C value, FQI, and mean wetness coefficient for each quadrat,
(C) Calculate native mean C value, and native FQI and mean wetness coefficient for each transect,
(D) Calculate the RIVn of total native species by the following equation:
RIVn = [RFn + RCn]/2 x 100, where:
RIVn is the relative importance value of the total native species in the community,
RFn is the total frequency of the native species occurring in all quadrats/the total frequency of all species (adventive and native) occurring in all
quadrats, and
RCn is the total coverage of the native species occurring in all quadrats/the total coverage of all species (adventive and native) occurring in all
quadrats.
(3) Hydrology Monitoring: A sufficient number of representative sample points shall be established in each mitigation wetland to assess the
hydrologic conditions. The sample points shall be monumented in the field with a metal stake. The location of each sample point shall be
accurately identified on the planting plan (subsection N3d of this section), which shall be included in the annual monitoring reports. At a
minimum, hydrology monitoring shall be conducted on a biweekly basis during the first growing season and on a monthly basis during each
succeeding growing season of the monitoring period. Hydrology sampling shall include the following, at a minimum:

management practices to be employed each year to meet the performance standards in subsection N8, "Performance Standards", of this
section, and a schedule of all proposed management practices (i.e., a calendar indicating month and year of activity). In addition, the plan shall
identify the entity to assume responsibility for long term management of the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers after the performance
period and the dedicated source of funding for long term management. At completion of the performance period, the SMC or IWCC shall require
a written agreement between the permittee and the entity identified for long term management.
(2) Management Practices: Describe the methods and equipment to be used for each proposed management practice (e.g., prescribed burning,
control of invasive plant species by herbicide application or hand removal, mow management, etc.). List all permits or certifications/licenses
required for the proposed management practices (e.g., IEPA open burn permit, local fire department permits, IDOA herbicide applicators license,
etc.). Personnel who perform the management activities shall have appropriate licenses and qualifications.
10. Reports: At a minimum, an annual report prepared by, or under the supervision of, a certified wetland specialist summarizing the results of the
previous year's monitoring data shall be submitted to the SMC or IWCC by January 31 of the following year. The annual reports shall contain, at a
minimum:

f. Recommendations for proposed management practices to be employed during the following year(s), based on the monitoring results to date; and
g. The proposed schedule for management practices in the following year(s).
11. Compliance And Completion:
a. Responsible Parties: The permittee shall be responsible for establishment of the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers and all associated
monitoring and management activities for the performance period. The permittee shall take corrective measures as necessary to meet the
performance standards in subsection N8, "Performance Standards", of this section, within the performance period.
After the performance period, the entity identified for long term management shall assume long term management for the mitigation wetlands and
wetland buffers. The permittee's responsibility for the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers shall be released in writing by the SMC or IWCC.
b. Notification: After the performance period, the permittee shall provide written notification to the SMC or IWCC, along with following information: 1)
a scaled plan (minimum 1 inch = 100 feet) showing the delineated boundaries and actual acreages of the mitigation wetlands and wetland buffers;
and 2) a summary of how the performance standards have been met for each wetland and buffer. Upon notification, the SMC or IWCC shall review
the submitted information and perform a site inspection to evaluate the success of the mitigation site. If the mitigation goals and performance
standards have been met, the SMC or IWCC shall notify the permittee in writing that the permittee's responsibility for the mitigation site is
released. A copy of the written release shall be provided to the entity designated for long term management of the mitigation site.
If the SMC or IWCC determine that the mitigation goals or performance standards have not been met based on the information submitted and site
inspection, the SMC or IWCC shall notify the permittee in writing of the specific shortfalls. The permittee shall be granted a specified time limit to
respond to the identified shortfalls. Failure to fully respond to the identified shortfalls within the specified time limit may result in SMC or IWCC use

1. Easements shall be provided for public utility services. They shall be a minimum of fifteen feet (15') wide for any single underground public utility and
a minimum of twenty feet (20') wide for two (2) underground public utilities and be established where practicable at the rear of each lot and along
such other lot lines as to provide continuity of alignment from block to block. Additional easement width may be required to accommodate unique
circumstances including, but not limited to, village utilities, multiple utilities, large utilities and/or extra deep utilities.
2. All utility distribution facilities shall be installed underground to the greatest extent possible within easements and/or within dedicated public ways.
Any aboveground boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to the public. In addition, the village may require landscape
screening and/or special access provisions. The installation of such facilities shall be made in compliance with applicable orders, rules, and
regulations, pursuant to the Illinois public utilities act and other applicable provisions of this code.
C. Drainage Easements: When a development is traversed by an established stream, established drainageway, or channel, there shall be provided a
stormwater easement or drainage right of way conforming substantially with the same course of said stream, drainageway or channel. The location,
width, alignment, and improvement of such easement shall be subject to the approval of the corporate authorities provided that such easement shall be
not less than twenty feet (20') in width. Where swale drainage is used in lieu of storm sewers, as may be permitted herein, the easement shall be of
sufficient width to allow future construction of a storm sewer main adequate to carry the ultimate runoff, including, but not limited to, runoff from any
adjacent public way, and/or of the watershed in accordance with the Barrington watershed development ordinance.
D. Combined Easements: Village, public utility, and/or drainage easements may be combined into a single, nonexclusive easement. The location, width,
alignment, and improvement of such easement shall be subject to the approval of the corporate authorities provided that such easement shall be not
less than twenty feet (20') in width.
E. Easement Language: All easements shall be as per the language as specified in appendix D on file with the village, except as otherwise approved by
the corporate authorities of the village, or by their designee. (Ord. 14-3798, 11-10-2014)
11-3-24: EXPECTATIONS IN PLANNED DEVELOPMENT:
Whenever a development is developed under the planned development provisions of the zoning ordinance, the corporate authorities may, at its sole
discretion, approve certain variation(s) or exception(s) from the requirements of this chapter relative to the arrangement of the street(s) and lots within the
proposed development, but at the same time protect the health, welfare, safety, and convenience of the potential future residents of the development as
well as the character of surrounding properties and the general welfare of the community. (Ord. 14-3798, 11-10-2014)
11-3-25: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES, PARK, FIRE/RESCUE, AND LIBRARY LANDS, OR CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN LIEU
THEREOF:
A. Legislative Intent: As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned development, each subdivider or developer shall
be required to dedicate land for library, park, recreational, fire/rescue and/or school purposes to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents
of the development, or shall be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 510/522
village with the concurrence of the affected district or districts, which concurrence shall be obtained in writing. However, the corporate authorities of the
village shall make the final determination in this regard. Land dedication sites may be made to the village or to the applicable district at the discretion of
the corporate authorities of the village. The dedications and cash contributions required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the criteria and
formulas herein.
B. Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedications:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned development shall bear directly on
the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: a)
estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the b) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such
school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to c) the appropriate number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the
estimated increase in number of students for each such school classification.
2. School Classifications And Size Of School Site: These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and literature on
the subject, including, but not limited to, information provided by the state superintendent of education and the unique characteristics of the village,
including its general rural character and open spaces, and the desire of the residents to maintain this character and open space in future school
sites. These requirements for acreage shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu
of land dedication herein unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall
be made in accordance with subsection Q of this section to the plan commission. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in
accordance with subsection Q of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:

3. Location: The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites.
School sites shall be located in the village in accordance with plans heretofore or hereafter adopted by the school district. If the school district has not
planned a school site within the village or the proposed subdivision or planned development, or in the neighborhood in which such subdivision or
planned development is located, the school site shall be so located as to be readily accessible to the greatest number of children projected for such
neighborhood.
C. Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreational Land Dedications:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 511/522
1. Suitability: The land for park and recreational dedications shall be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. Land set aside by developers for
parks, recreation and conservation purposes shall not be what has been "left over" after residential, commercial and industrial development.
2. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the amount of land required for dedication
for park and recreational purposes. The total requirement shall be ten (10) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population and may be
allocated by the corporate authorities of the village at its discretion based upon the following criteria:
Type Of
Recreation Area Minimum Size Park Acreage Per 1,000 Persons
Play lot 8,000 square feet < 1
Neighborhood park 3 acres 2 acres
Villagewide park for active sports 10 acres 4 acres
Villagewide community park 15 acres 4 acres
These requirements for acreage are based upon a review of available data studies and literature on the subject, including, but not limited to, the
National Recreation And Park Association's "Recreation, Park And Open Space Standards And Guidelines, 1990". These requirements shall be
presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless timely
objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular development shall be made in accordance with
subsection Q of this section herein to the plan commission. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance with subsection Q
of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
3. Location: The park and recreation plans as adopted by the village's comprehensive plan shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central
location that will serve equally the entire development or a location that is adjacent to existing park and recreational land is most desirable. In large
developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances.
D. Fire/Rescue Capital Facilities Contributions And Site Dedication:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The development of new subdivisions and planned developments increases the demands upon the existing
fire/rescue protection service provided by the village in a proportionate and ascertainable manner and create the need for additional fire/rescue,
firehouse and training sites. Studies reveal the need to develop additional fire/rescue protection services. Therefore, as a condition of approval of a
final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned development, each developer or subdivider shall be required to dedicate land for fire/rescue
facilities to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or shall be required to make a cash contribution in lieu of
actual land dedication.
The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the amount of land required for a fire/rescue site dedication. The corporate
authorities of the village have determined that the total requirement shall be three (3) acres of land per ten thousand (10,000) of ultimate population.
This requirement is based upon a review of available data as well as the fire/rescue districts' own internal examination of fire/rescue utilization and
needs.
This contribution and/or dedication is based upon a review of available data, studies and literature, including, but not limited to, the requirements of
surrounding communities. They shall be presumed to be correct and accurate and shall be used in calculating cash contributions herein unless
timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to this subsection D shall be made in accordance with subsection Q of this section. Failure to timely
object to these requirements in strict accordance with subsection Q of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
The fire/rescue capital facilities contribution shall be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the corporate authorities of the
village and shall be used for the purpose of providing additional facilities for municipal purposes. The village may contract with other units of local
government for the provision of fire/rescue services. Funds obtained pursuant to this subsection D may be transferred to those entities for the
purpose of assisting in the provision of additional facilities which will benefit the village.
2. Location: The location of any new fire/rescue facility and/or training site shall be determined by corporate authorities of the village.
E. Criteria For Requiring Library Site Dedication:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly on the amount of land required for
dedication. New development and increased population create greater demands for adequate and efficient library services to meet the educational,
cultural and recreational needs of the citizenry. They create the need for additional library facilities. The corporate authorities of the village have
determined that the total requirement shall be 2.5 acres of land per ten thousand (10,000) of ultimate population.
These requirements are based upon a review of available data, studies and literature on the subject, as well as the library district's own internal
examination of library utilization and needs. They shall be presumed as the appropriate acreage requirements and shall be used in calculating any
cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided herein. Objections to these acreage requirements for any particular
development shall be made in accordance with subsection Q of this section. Failure to timely object to these acreage requirements in accordance
with subsection Q of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
2. Location: The location of any new library facility shall be determined by the library after consultation with the village.
F. Criteria For Requiring A Cash Contribution In Lieu Of Dedication Of School, Park, Library And Fire/Rescue Sites:
When the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational
purposes or school, fire/rescue or library sites or is in conflict with the approved comprehensive school plan, the corporate authorities of the village,
with the concurrence of the affected district, shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land dedication.
The cash contribution in lieu of dedication of school sites shall be held in trust by the benefiting school district, or its designee, and shall be used solely
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 512/522
for the acquisition of land for school sites to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the expansion
of any existing school site that already serves such needs, but not for the construction of school buildings or additions thereto unless agreed to
otherwise by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the benefiting park district, or its designee, and shall be
used solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as classified above, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development or for the expansion of other existing local park and recreation lands that already serve such needs or for
any other lawful park purpose or for any park purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
The cash contribution in lieu of a library site dedication shall be held in trust by the benefiting library district or its designee, and shall be used for the
acquisition of library land as required herein, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or
development or for the expansion of existing or proposed library facilities that already serve or will serve such needs or for any other lawful purpose
agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
The cash contribution in lieu of fire/rescue sites shall be held in trust by the Barrington fire department or other public body as designated by the
corporate authorities of the village and shall be used for the acquisition of land for fire/rescue facilities or training sites to serve the immediate and
future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the expansion of any other existing fire station or training site that already serves
such needs or for any other lawful fire/rescue purpose agreed to by the subdivider or developer at the time of platting.
If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation or fire/rescue land dedication or dedication of library and/or school sites is not
expended for the purposes set forth herein within thirteen (13) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded by the entity holding the contribution
to the record owner of the subdivided land at the time of the refund. If there is more than one record owner of the subdivided land or of the land that
comprises the planned development, as applicable, such record owners shall share in the refund pro rata based on the cash contributions originally
paid by each property.
1. Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the acres of land in the area that otherwise
would have been dedicated as park and recreation, library, fire rescue and school sites. The fair market value, on a per acre basis, shall assume,
unless determined otherwise pursuant to this subsection F1, that the land is zoned in a one-family dwelling residential zoning district subdivided with
appropriate frontage on a dedicated street or road, has all appropriate utilities available, is improved as set forth in subsections K and L of this
section, and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development. Based upon a study of comparable real estate transactions, it
has been determined that the present "fair market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the village is, as of the effective date of this
section as follows:
a. One hundred ninety six thousand dollars ($196,000.00) per acre for purposes of locating an elementary or junior high school.
b. Three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) per acre for purposes of adding on to the existing high school.
c. One hundred ninety six thousand dollars ($196,000.00) per acre for purposes of locating a park. (It should be noted that land suitable for park and
recreational purposes may have a lesser value depending upon location, buildability, and whether the site is used as an active or passive park
site.)
d. Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) per acre for purposes of locating a fire station. (It should be noted that fire stations must be
strategically located to maximize response time and have access to major arterial roads, and this fair market value reflects these considerations.)
e. Three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) per acre for purposes of locating and/or adding on to the existing library. (It should be noted
that an addition to the existing library would entail purchase of property adjoining the existing library. A second library must be strategically located
to accommodate the maximum number of patrons, and in the tradition of the existing library, be on a major thoroughfare.)
These figures shall be adjusted by the corporate authorities of the village from time to time with appropriate study and documentation. The "fair
market value" as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land dedication herein unless timely objected to as provided in
subsection Q of this section. Objections to the fair market value as defined above shall be made in accordance with subsection Q of this section to
the plan commission. Failure to timely object to the "fair market value" as defined above in accordance with subsection Q of this section shall
thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
2. Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Contribution: There will be situations in subdivisions or planned developments when a combination of land
dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: a) only a portion of the land to be developed
is proposed as the location for a library, park, fire/rescue or school site (that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the library, park,
fire/rescue or school location shall be dedicated as a site as stated above, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional
land that would have been required to be dedicated); or b) a major part of the local library, park, fire/rescue or school site has already been acquired
by the particular district or village and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site (the remaining portion shall
be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof for the rest of the required land shall be required).
G. Consumer Price Index: The fair market value identified in subsection F of this section shall be subject to a "CPI adjustment" which shall be calculated
on January 1, 2004, and on January 1 in each year thereafter. Annually, the fixed charge shall be adjusted to an amount equal to the fixed charge
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the "all items" consumer price index for urban consumers (1982-84 = 100) for Chicago, Illinois,
published by the United States department of labor's bureau of labor statistics ("CPI") for the month of December preceding the year of adjustment and
the denominator of which is the CPI for the month of December preceding the month of adjustment. If any index is calculated from a base different from
the base period 1982-84 = 100, such index shall be converted to a base period of 1982-84 = 100 by use of a conversion factor supplied by said bureau
of labor statistics. If the CPI is discontinued or replaced, such other governmental cost of living index or computation which replaces the CPI shall be
used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the CPI had not been discontinued or replaced.
H. Density Formula: The "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit", prepared by Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal
Consultants, Inc., Naperville, Illinois, and as updated from time to time by the consulting firm contained in exhibit C on file with the village, constitutes
projections of anticipated population density and is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction
and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is
filed thereto by the subdivider or developer pursuant to subsection Q of this section.
A bedroom as used in this section shall include any room which may be used for bedroom purposes, such as a den, study, loft or extra room located on
any floor in a dwelling unit which may be convertible into a sleeping area and is not clearly identified for some other specific purpose such as a kitchen
(1 per unit), dining room (1 per unit), living room (1 per unit), bathroom(s) and family room (1 per unit).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 513/522
The most recent version of the "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit" shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land
dedication herein unless objected to as provided in subsection Q of this section. Objections to the "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per
Dwelling Unit" shall be made in accordance with subsection Q of this section. Failure to object to the "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per
Dwelling Unit" in accordance with subsection Q of this section shall thereafter waive any right to raise an objection at a later time.
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the "Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit" listed above, he shall
submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned development, and in
that event final determination of the density formula shall be made in accordance with this subsection.
I. Reservation Of Additional Land: When the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or
library or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned development than the developer is required to dedicate pursuant to this section, the land
needed beyond the developer's dedication shall be set aside and reserved by the developer for subsequent purchase by the village (at a price
determined at the time of reservation) or other public body designated by the corporate authorities of the village, provided that such acquisition is made
within five (5) years from the date of approval of the final plat.
J. Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where appropriate, a public open space or a school site that is to be dedicated should, if possible, be
combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas and/or school sites without undue hardship on a
particular developer.
K. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose.
Wetlands and floodplains may be accepted for village ownership and maintenance, but shall not serve as a credit toward the required park site
dedication. Stormwater detention areas shall not be accepted for village ownership and maintenance, and the portion of a detention area designed to
function primarily as a component of the stormwater control system shall not serve as a credit toward the required park site dedication. A park site shall
be not less than one acre in area. The corporate authorities of the village reserves the right, however, in its sole discretion, to accept in whole or in part,
certain areas such as, but not limited to, tree massings, prairie remnants, high quality or unique wetlands, or other natural features as all or part of the
required park site dedication in furtherance of open space preservation that may be unique to a given parcel or development. Wetlands, floodplains,
detention areas, retention areas and areas of steep slope shall not be accepted as school, park, fire/rescue or library sites and shall not serve as a
credit toward the required school, park, fire/rescue or library site cash contribution in lieu of land dedication.
In addition, the following site conditions and preparation standards shall be met:
1. Slope:
a. Should not vary greatly in appearance from existing and adjacent slopes;
b. Optimum slopes range from two percent (2%) minimum to five percent (5%) maximum. No less than two percent (2%) slope is acceptable under
any circumstances;
c. Maximum allowable slope is ten percent (10%), except under special conditions where greater slopes are desirable to enhance the use of the site;
and
d. On site drainage patterns shall be designated and constructed to:
(1) Ensure flow toward swales; and
(2) Ensure drainage away from active areas.
2. Grading:
a. Rough grading shall be completed at time of rough grading of adjacent contiguous area;
b. Grading shall comply with village approved plans;
c. Subgrade shall be graded and compacted so it will parallel finished grade;
d. Subgrade material shall be loosened and fine graded to a depth of two to four inches (2 - 4"). All stones over four inches (4") in size, sticks, debris,
rubbish and other foreign substances shall be removed; and
e. Finished grades shall be uniform in slope between points for which elevations have been established.
3. Soils:
a. Soils shall not differ from those naturally occurring;
b. Soils shall not offer any restriction to the ultimate use of the property;
c. Topsoil shall be spread evenly and lightly compacted to a minimum depth of six inches (6") over the entire site;
d. Topsoil must be good, friable soils with good tillage and shall be without any admixture of subsoil, clay, gravel, stones, debris, refuse, sand or other
subsurface elements;
e. Topsoil shall not be placed in a muddy or frozen condition;
f. Topsoil shall contain no toxic substances which may be harmful to plant growth; and
g. Topsoil shall be spread no later than the placement of topsoil on the first lot adjacent to the site.
4. Seeding:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 514/522
a. All proposed library, park and recreational and school sites shall be seeded and an acceptable stand of grass or vegetation established prior to
dedication of the area to the village;
b. Village approved ground covers and grasses shall be used for all park and recreational areas suitable for the nature of the activity planned to
occur thereon;
c. Seeding shall be completed during the fall or spring planting times, depending upon the recommended seed planting specifications;
d. Seeding shall be on moderately dry soil on a seed bed which will easily accept and nurture germination of seeds;
e. Seeding shall be watered sufficiently so that the vegetation becomes reasonably established; and
f. The developer shall be responsible for making necessary reparations to the site caused by erosion or other damage. Reparations shall be
completed prior to acceptance of the site.
L. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electricity, natural gas, telephone and cable television, and streets
(including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter, where applicable), as applicable to the location of the site, and shall otherwise comply with the
requirements of the village ordinances and codes. The landscaping normally included within the definition of "improved" sites under said ordinances
and codes may be deleted due to the delay time between dedication of any such school site and the construction of school facilities thereon, except for
ground cover as required in subsection K of this section. The site shall have direct access to a fully improved street across at least twenty percent
(20%) of the distance of its perimeter. School and park sites should ideally be accessible by a bicycle/pedestrian trail, and any such access route onto
the property shall be at least twenty five feet (25') wide. Such access routes should normally be dedications and not easements, depending on which
entity of government is to be responsible for said routes. Any vehicular access route leading to or on the site shall be of sufficient size and good
geometry to properly accommodate vehicles that will access and traverse the site, including, but not limited to, good principles of traffic circulation,
accommodation of one-way and/or two-way drives for school buses, separation of bus traffic from passenger automobile traffic, bus drop off areas
separate from publicly dedicated streets, guest and employee parking areas, and the like. Such off street access routes, drives, drop offs and parking
areas will not be dedicated rights of way and shall be the responsibility of the owner of the site to maintain.
M. Environmental Risk Audit: Prior to the conveyance of any land to the village, library district, park district, fire protection district (where applicable), or
school district, the intended grantee shall be furnished with an environmental risk audit prepared by an environmental professional meeting the
minimum requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii), certified to and acceptable to the grantee, assuring the grantee that there
are no hazardous substance(s) (as defined hereinafter) on, under, to or from the land. Said environmental audit shall be what is commonly referred to
as a phase I environmental audit, which shall meet the minimum requirements for a preacquisition audit as set forth in 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii)(v).
In the event the phase I environmental audit does not conclude there is no presence or likely presence of a release or substantial threat of a release of
hazardous substance(s) or pesticide on, under, to or from the land, the grantee shall furnish a phase II environmental audit as set forth in 415 Illinois
Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii)(vi), including a soil toxicity analysis and recommendation from said environmental professional, meeting the
minimum requirements of 415 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/22.2(j)(6)(E)(iii), which concludes that there is no presence or likely presence of a release or
substantial threat of a release of hazardous substance(s) on, under, to or from the land, and certifying that, in the judgment of said environmental
professional, there is no reasonable probability that the land contains any hazardous substance(s) in violation of any federal or state environmental
standards.
In the event said phase II environmental audit and/or soil toxicity analysis discloses the presence or likely presence of a release or a substantial threat
of a release of any hazardous substance(s) at, on, under, to or from the land to be conveyed, the grantor shall first cause all such hazardous
substance(s) to be removed at its sole cost and expense in accordance with all federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations and
furnish the intended grantee with a "no further remediation letter" from the governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the cleanup prior to
conveyance of any of the land to the intended grantee.
Prior to the conveyance of the land, the subdivider or developer, as the case may be, and the owner of the land to be conveyed, shall execute and
deliver to the intended grantee an environmental indemnification agreement, which form has been approved by the village attorney, agreeing to defend,
indemnify and hold the village, its corporate authorities, officers, officials, employees, agents, successors and assigns, and the school district, as the
case may be, and its respective officers, officials, employees, agents, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all liability, claims,
damages, causes of action and expenses arising out of the presence of any hazardous substance(s) in, under or upon said land to be conveyed prior
to the date of conveyance.
Hazardous substance(s) includes, without limitation:
1. Those substances included in the definitions of hazardous substances, extremely hazardous substances, hazardous materials, toxic substances,
toxic chemicals, toxic wastes, hazardous chemicals, hazardous wastes, solid waste and pesticides in CERLA, SARA, RCRA, HSWA, TSCA, OSHA,
FWPCE, Illinois pesticides act1, Illinois responsible property transfer act2 and the Illinois hazardous materials transportation act3, 49 USC section
1801 et seq., as amended, and as they may be amended in the future, and in the regulations promulgated pursuant to said laws.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=576 517/522
b. Based upon the needs assessment, the school district, fire/rescue district or library district shall provide the village an acquisition plan for lands
and capital facilities. This acquisition plan shall:
(1) Project for a planning period of at least five (5) years, the need for lands and capital facilities within the district or village;
(2) Set forth a schedule for the acquisition of such lands and facilities to meet the projected need (which schedule may be conditioned upon the
availability of financing);
(3) Indicate the size and general location of the needed lands and facilities;
(4) Identify the estimated or incurred costs of acquiring such needed lands and facilities;
(5) Set forth the anticipated funding sources for the acquisition of such needed lands and facilities;
(6) Determine the feasibility of acquiring the needed land and facilities based upon the district's current financial condition;

without limitation, cash in lieu of land dedication required by this section pursuant to the plan).
(8) The impact on property taxes in the village assuming the plan is implemented.
c. If the village deems it necessary, it may require an updated needs assessment and plan for acquisition of land and capital facilities from the district
annually. The failure to require said assessment update shall not invalidate the requirements of this subsection.
V. Time Of Payment: All land dedications and cash contributions imposed by this section shall be due and payable upon final plat approval. However, the
village may agree that the payment of the cash contributions may be made at the time of building permit issuance in consideration of which the
subdivider or developer shall execute an agreement, which is exhibit B on file with the village agreeing that the cash contributions payable will be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements herein and further agreeing that the cash contributions may be expended for the purposes described in
exhibit B on file with the village. Such agreement to delay the payment of impact fees shall be recorded as an encumbrance on the title of the property
and shall be included in the subdivision covenants for said property. In calculating the fee at the time of platting, the village will assume the maximum
density permitted under the zoning classification approved pursuant to the table attached as exhibit C on file with the village. For example, if the
subdivision in question is zoned single-family, the village will assume for purposes of calculating fees payable, pursuant to this section, that all houses
will have four (4) or more bedrooms. The benefiting district will then hold sufficient funds pending issuance of the building permit. The village will direct
the benefiting district to refund any overpayments resulting from the fact that houses with less than four (4) bedrooms are constructed. Refunds shall
be made at time of issuance of the building permit.
For any lot which received final plat approval prior to the enactment of this chapter, and which remains vacant at the time this section is enacted, then
all dedications and fees imposed by this section shall be due and payable at the time a building permit is issued.
The village may agree that payment of fees be made at the time of building permit issuance in consideration of which the subdivider or developer shall
execute the agreement, which is exhibit B on file with the village, agreeing that the fees payable will be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of
this section and further agreeing that the fees may be expended for the purposes described in said exhibit B on file with the village. In the event the
village agrees to delay the payment of the fees required under this section to the time of building permit issuance, the village shall notify the benefiting
district, the cash contributions owed shall be based upon this section or as provided in such future amendments hereto, which are in effect at the time
the building permit is issued.
W. Miscellaneous: In calculating any cash contributions in lieu of land dedication payable at time of issuance of building permit as provided in subsection V
of this section, the village shall use the fair market value as set forth in subsection F of this section or any amendment thereto and in effect at the time
of the contribution and building permit issuance.
The village recognizes the fact that developments may differ in their impact upon a community. Consequently, the village reserves the right to negotiate
dedications that are different from those contained in this section when annexing property to the village pursuant to an annexation agreement.
Previously approved final plats of subdivision shall be subject to all fees and dedications required by this section. The required fees shall be paid to the
benefiting district and required dedications conveyed to the village by the applicant prior to the issuance of a building permit. (Ord. 14-3798, 11-10-
2014)

11-3-28: LETTERS OF CREDIT OR CASH DEPOSITS; MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE:
No final plat or final plan shall be approved unless and until there has been posted with the village an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a responsible
financial institution approved by the village, in such amount as hereinafter described, and in such form as approved by the village attorney, to assure that
adequate funds will be available to the village to complete and maintain all required public improvements, including off site improvements, if the developer
shall fail to complete and/or maintain the said improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications and schedule approved by the village
manager, or his designee. The term "required public improvements", as used herein, shall mean those described in this chapter.
A. Principal Amount Of Letter Of Credit: The principal amount of said letter of credit shall be in an amount equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the current estimate of the costs of construction, installation, completion, and maintenance prior to acceptance of the required public improvements
prepared by the developer's engineer and approved by the village manager, or his designee.

letter of credit for the purpose of completion and/or maintenance of such required public improvements in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, but in no instance shall the village be liable for any damage thereby incurred nor shall such action by the village constitute acceptance of such
required public improvements.
D. Maintenance Guarantee: Prior to the village's acceptance of the required public improvements in any subdivision or other development, the developer
shall also provide to the village a letter of credit in the amount of five percent (5%) of the estimated final construction costs of the required public

defective materials within the limits of said public improvements. Said maintenance guarantee shall remain in effect for a period of one year, or such
longer period of time as deemed necessary by the village, and shall be for use by the village for the purpose of making any repairs to or replacement of
said public improvements as deemed by the village to be necessary for public safety and/or to make any repairs which the developer may have
neglected to make for seventy two (72) hours after notification thereof by the village. The developer shall be required to maintain all required public
improvements in the subdivision or other development until the village's acceptance thereof and all maintenance guarantees of the developer have
been released and the developer has performed all required maintenance for and/or replacement of the required public improvements. After
acceptance thereof by the village, maintenance of said public improvements by the developer shall not include removal of snow on streets and other
public ways which shall be the village's responsibility to undertake upon acceptance thereof.
E. Cash Deposit: In lieu of any of the aforesaid letters of credit, the developer may make a cash deposit with the village in the amount(s) as set forth in this
section, which cash deposit may be used by the village as a performance or maintenance guarantee for any of the purposes set forth in this section.
F. Exception: Letters of credit, cash deposits or maintenance guarantee requirements shall not apply to individual single-family lots that do not require
replatting or resubdivision of any kind except as otherwise provided in section 1-14-1 of this code. (Ord. 14-3798, 11-10-2014)

streets and roadways providing access to the development shall be completed after occupancy of ninety percent (90%) of the development or as approved
by the village engineer or his designee. (Ord. 14-3798, 11-10-2014)

construction has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications previously approved by the village, the corporate authorities will formally
accept the required public improvements which are to be dedicated to the village. Prior to such acceptance, however, the engineer representing the
developer shall prepare and submit to the village two (2) complete sets of as built drawings of all installed improvements on which also are shown or
indicated any changes in the original construction drawings that were made during the construction period, which as built drawings shall comply with

1. After the effective date of this Ordinance, all subdivision of land, buildings,

1.4 TRANSITION RULES
In determining the applicability of this Ordinance with respect to the previously applicable zoning
regulations, the following rules shall apply.
A. Existing Unlawful Uses and Structures
A structure or use not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance is
hereby deemed lawful as of the effective date of this Ordinance provided that it conforms
with all of the requirements of this Ordinance. However, if such structure or use does not
conform with all of the requirements of this Ordinance, such structure or use remains
unlawful hereunder.
B. Existing Permitted Uses
When a lot is used for a purpose that was classified as a permitted use prior to the
effective date of this Ordinance, and such use is classified as a “special use” by this
Ordinance, such use is hereby deemed a lawful special use for the purpose of this
Ordinance. Any alteration or expansion of such use shall conform to the requirements for
special uses in Chapter 3 of this Ordinance.
C. Principal Uses Rendered Nonconforming
When a lot is used for a purpose which was a lawful use before the effective date of this
Ordinance and this Ordinance, or any amendment thereto, no longer classifies such use as
either a permitted use or special use in the zoning district in which it is located, such use
is hereby deemed a legal nonconforming use and shall be controlled by the provisions of
Chapter 10, Nonconformity.
D. Principal Buildings, Structures and Lots Rendered Nonconforming
Where any lawful principal building, structure or lot existing on the effective date of this
Ordinance does not meet all standards set forth in this Ordinance, or any amendment
thereto, such building, structure or lot is hereby deemed nonconforming and shall be
controlled by the provisions of Chapter 10, Nonconformity.
Chapter 1, Page – 4
E. Accessory Uses, Structures, and Buildings Rendered Nonconforming
When any lawful accessory building, structure or use existing on the effective date of this

modified and resubmitted for approval. If the Zoning Official decides to
deny the application, a letter of denial shall be issued.
g. Referral to Architectural Review Commission. The Zoning Official may
refer any application to the Architectural Review Commission due to the
complexity of the application, the significance of proposed change to a

direction to assist in the development of a plan which would be consistent with the
requirements and purpose of this Ordinance.
F. Preliminary Committee of the Whole Review
Upon completion of the pre-application conference, the Zoning Official may, in his or her
discretion, require preliminary presentation of the proposed development at a meeting of
the Committee of the Whole of the Village Board. At the meeting, the Committee of the
Whole shall review conceptual drawings, sketches and other information concerning the
proposed development, depicting buildings, structures, public and private improvements,
and landscaping of the proposed development. The Committee of the Whole may provide
such advice, counsel and suggestions and recommendations as it may deem necessary to
guide the applicant in the preparation of plans which would comply with the requirements
and purposes of this Ordinance and the general policies of the Village. It shall be
understood that the Committee of the Whole shall act in an advisory capacity only, and
shall not participate in the development of the basic concept, plans or drawings.
G. Preliminary Architectural Review Commission Consideration
Any applicant or prospective applicant seeking an Architectural Review Certificate of
Approval shall have concept sketches and drawings reviewed under preliminary
consideration by the Architectural Review Commission. Such preliminary consideration
shall be provided at a meeting of the Architectural Review Commission. At the meeting,
the Architectural Review Commission shall review preliminary exterior drawings,
sketches, landscape and site plans, and materials for the proposed project before a formal
application is filed. The commission shall provide such advice, counsel, suggestions and
recommendations as it may deem necessary to guide the applicant in the preparation of
Chapter 3 – Page 16
plans which would comply with the requirements and purposes of this Ordinance. In the
case of an application for either a Special Use or Planned Development, the Architectural
Review Commission shall transmit its preliminary recommendations to the Zoning Board
of Appeals or Plan Commission. It shall be understood that the Architectural Review
Commission shall act in an advisory capacity only, with regard to preliminary plans, and
shall provide consultation only on projects for which preliminary drawings and materials
are furnished by said prospective applicant, and shall not participate in the development of
the basic concept, plans or drawings. The Zoning Official may waive the requirement for
preliminary consideration if, in his or her opinion, such consideration is not necessary, due
to the nature of the work being proposed.
For projects which require consideration by the Plan Commission or the Zoning Board of
Appeals, preliminary review by the Architectural Review Commission shall occur prior to
the Plan Commission or Zoning Board of Appeals hearing and then formal consideration
thereof by the Architectural Review Commission shall occur after the Plan Commission or
Zoning Board of Appeals hearing on the proposal has been completed and prior to
consideration by the Board of Trustees.
H. Action of Architectural Review Commission
At the meeting of the Architectural Review Commission, the commission shall discuss the
application and its conformance to the requirements of this Ordinance. The commission
shall also hear testimony from the applicant, adjacent property owners and the public. All
testimony given at such meeting shall be under oath. Upon hearing all testimony, the
commission shall make specific findings for each applicable provision of the Design
Standards in the district regulations as well as the standards and guidelines within the
Appearance Code. In making its decision, the commission may recommend the: a) denial;
b) granting; or c) granting with modifications or conditions, of the application for
Architectural Review Certificate of Approval. In the event of a Special Use or Planned
Development, the Architectural Review Commission shall transmit its recommendations
to the President and Board of Trustees at the conclusion of the Zoning Board of Appeals
or Plan Commission public hearings.
I. Failure of Architectural Review Commission to Act
Should the Architectural Review Commission fail to take formal final action on a complete
application prior to the initial consideration of the project by the President and Board of
Trustees, the applicant may petition directly to the Village President and Board of Trustees
for approval. Such petition shall be made in writing and shall be filed with the Zoning
Official. The President and Board of Trustees shall then consider and decide on such a
petition within a reasonable time period after a completed petition to the Village President
and Board of Trustees has been filed with the Zoning Official.
J. Approval by the Village Board of Trustees
The President and Board of Trustees shall review the minutes of the Architectural Review
Commission meeting, which shall be filed with the Village Board of Trustees no more than
forty-five (45) days after the Architectural Review Commission meeting. However, in the
event of a Special Use or Planned Development, the minutes of the Architectural Review
Commission shall be filed after the conclusion of the Zoning Board of Appeals or Plan
Commission Public Hearing. The Village Board of Trustees shall make a final decision on
the application within a reasonable time period after receipt by such Board of Trustees of
the Architectural Review Commission's recommendation. For petitions made directly to
Chapter 3 – Page 17
the Village Board of Trustees due to inaction by the Architectural Review Commission,
the Village Board shall make a final decision on said application within a reasonable time
period after the filing of the petition.
K. Emergency Measures
The Architectural Review process is not required when, in the opinion of the Zoning
Official, there is an actual or immediate danger of collapse or failure of a building or
structure, or any part thereof, which would endanger life or physically damage adjoining
property. The Zoning Official may also waive the Architectural Review process when, in
his or her opinion, the proposed work is of such limited scope and in sufficient conformance
with the applicable zoning district design guidelines so as not to require review.
L. Amendments
Amendments to an Architectural Review Certificate of Approval require an application
and approval as if for a new application. The Zoning Official may waive such requirement
when, in his or her opinion, the proposed amendment is of such limited scope and in
sufficient conformance with the Certificate of Approval, so as not to require a new
application.
M. Enforcement
The Zoning Official shall be responsible for inspecting construction activity to determine
that no substantial deviations from the approved plans have occurred.
1. It shall be the duty of the applicant, or his successors and assigns, to comply with
the requirements of the Architectural Review Certificate of Approval and to obtain
such inspections as may be necessary in order to assure compliance with such
certificate. The Zoning Official shall notify the applicant of any violations. If the
said violations are not corrected within ten (10) days, the Zoning Official may issue
a stop work order and such work shall be immediately stopped until the violation
is corrected. Any such stop work order shall be given orally, then confirmed in
writing and sent to the applicant for the building permit. Any work done after the
issuance of a stop work order shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and
subject to the penalties established herein.
2. Before any use may be made of improvements constructed under the provisions of
the Appearance Code, a final inspection of the premises must be obtained from the
Zoning Official, or his designee, and a certificate of occupancy for those buildings
or structures requiring certificates of occupancy shall not be issued unless such an
inspection had been made and completed and the work found to be in substantial
compliance with plans approved by the Architectural Review Commission and
under which the certificate was issued, except as provided in Subsection 3.13(L)
of this Section.
3. If it should become impossible to complete all work required before occupancy
due to extraordinary weather, labor strike or any other circumstance beyond
control of the certificate holder, the Zoning Official may, but shall not be obligated
to, temporarily approve such use and/or occupancy with a written agreement by
the applicant to guarantee completion of the work still required by the certificate
as soon as the circumstances causing such impossibility have been abated, as long
as there are no life safety concerns.
Chapter 3 – Page 18
4. In the event the person, firm or corporation to whom the Architectural Review
Certificate of Approval has been granted fails to complete the above-stated work,
a final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for those structures, which
require certificates of occupancy.
N. Limitations on Certificates of Approval
1. An Architectural Review Certificate of Approval shall automatically become null
and void unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun
within in one (1) year after the issuance of the Certificate of Approval and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion. However, the Village Board of
Trustees may extend the one (1) year period to a mutually agreed upon time.
2. An Architectural Review Certificate of Approval applies only to the property
represented in the application and is not transferable to other properties.
O. Effect of Approval
The approval of an Architectural Review Certificate of Approval by the Village Board of
Trustees shall not authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or
moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and
processing of applications for such permits or approvals as may be required by the
regulations of the Village including, but not limited to, a zoning certificate and a building
permit.

“marijuana,” “cannabis,” or any other word, phrase or symbol commonly
understood to refer to marijuana or cannabis.
g. All operations of a Medical Cannabis Cultivation Center must be fully
enclosed within a locked building.
8. Medical Cannabis Dispensing Organization
a. Medical Cannabis Dispensing Organizations located within the Village
shall be and are required to be established, operated, and maintained in full
compliance with the “Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot
Program Act” (hereinafter, “the Compassionate Use Act”) and all other
applicable Village ordinances and Illinois statutes.
b. Medical Cannabis Dispensing Organizations shall not be located within
such specified distance from pre-existing public or private pre-schools,

G. Supplementary Safeguards and Conditions
The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the Village Board of Trustees may
provide, such conditions and restrictions upon the construction, location and operation of
a Special Use as may be deemed necessary to promote the general objective of this
Ordinance and to minimize any injury to the value of property in the neighborhood. Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the Special Use permit and
shall be recorded by the property owner as a supplement to the deed for the property in the
County Recorder’s Office. Failure to maintain such conditions or restrictions as may have
been imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of such Special Use permit, pursuant
to Section 3.20 (Violations and Penalties).
H. No Presumption of Approval
The listing of Special Uses within each zoning district does not constitute an assurance or
presumption that such Special Uses will be approved. Rather, each proposed Special Use
shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to its compliance with the standards
and conditions set forth in this Section 3.15, and with the standards for the district in which
it is located, in order to determine whether approval of the Special Use is appropriate at the
particular location and in the particular manner proposed.
Chapter 3 – Page 24
I. Limitation on Special Uses
1. A Special Use permit shall automatically become null and void unless a building
permit is issued and construction is actually begun within in one (1) year of
issuance and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. However, the Village
Board of Trustees may extend the one (1) year period to a mutually agreed upon
time.
2. A Special Use permit authorizes the conduct of the Special Use only on the
property described in the application and is not transferable to other properties.
3. A Special Use permit shall automatically become null and void if the use
authorized by said permit is abandoned or discontinued for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months, regardless of any evidence of intent not to abandon and/or to
resume such use, or if the Owner or Petitioner files a written declaration with the
Village indicating that such Special Use has permanently ceased to operate on the
Property.
J. Effect of Approval
The approval of a Special Use permit application by the Village Board of Trustees shall
not authorize the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing and processing of
applications for such permits or approvals as may be required by the regulations of the
Village including, but not limited to, a Zoning Certificate and a building permit.
3.16 VARIATIONS
A. Establishment and Purpose
The Variation process is hereby established to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by
which relief may be granted from unforeseen applications of this Ordinance that create
practical difficulties or particular hardships. When such difficulties or hardships are more
appropriate for remedy, if at all, pursuant to other provisions of this Chapter, the variation
procedure is necessarily inappropriate.
B. Authority
In accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this Section 3.16, the Village
Board of Trustees, following the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, shall
have the authority to grant variations from the provisions of this Ordinance, but only in
accordance with each of the standards enumerated in Subsection 3.16(F).
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Variations
An application for a Variation may be filed by the property owner, agent of the property
owner, or the contract purchaser of the subject property, with the consent of the property
owner.
D. Application
Applications for a Variation shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section
3.7 (Applications and Hearing).
Chapter 3 – Page 25
E. Procedures
1. Action by Zoning Official. Upon receipt of a properly completed application, the
Zoning Official shall review the application and forward a staff report to the
Zoning Board of Appeals for review.
2. Action by Zoning Board of Appeals.
a. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application
in accordance with the requirements of Section 3.7 (Application and
Hearings). Notice for the public hearing shall be performed in the manner
prescribed by Section 3.7(C).
b. Within forty-five (45) days of the close of the public hearing, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall forward its recommendation of either approval,
approval with modifications, or disapproval in writing to the President and
Board of Trustees.
3. Action by Village Board of Trustees.
a. The President and Board of Trustees shall consider the application for a
variation within a reasonable period of time after its receipt from the
Zoning Board of Appeals of its recommendation relative to such
application and shall either approve, approve with modifications, or
disapprove of the application.
b. If the application is approved or approved with modifications, the Village
Board of Trustees shall approve a zoning variation ordinance, listing any
specific conditions specified by the Village Board of Trustees. If the
application is disapproved, the Village Board of Trustees shall instruct the
Zoning Official to provide the applicant with written notification of the
Board’s decision.
F. Findings of Fact for Variations
A Variation from the terms of this Ordinance shall not be granted unless the reviewing
authority makes specific written findings of fact directly based on the standards and
conditions imposed by this Section and any conditions imposed by the reviewing authority.
1. Practical Difficulty. No Variation shall be granted unless the applicant shall
establish that carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this Ordinance would
create a particular hardship or a practical difficulty.
2. Unique Physical Condition. The subject property is exceptional as compared to
other properties subject to the same provision by reason of a unique physical
condition, including presence of an existing use, structure, or sign, whether
conforming or nonconforming, irregular or substandard shape or size, exceptional
topographical features, or other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to, and
inherent in, the subject property that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to
the owner and that relate to or arise out of the property rather than the personal
situation of the current owner of the property.
3. Not Self-Created. The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the result of any
action or inaction of the owner and existed at the time of the enactment of the
Chapter 3 – Page 26
provisions from which a variance is sought or was created by natural forces or was
the result of governmental action, other than the adoption of this Ordinance.
4. Denied Substantial Rights. The carrying out of the strict letter of the provision from
which a variance is sought would deprive the owner of the subject property of
substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other properties subject to the
same provision.
5. Not Merely Special Privilege. The alleged hardship or difficulty is neither merely
the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special privilege or additional
right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same
provision, nor merely the inability of the owner to make more money from the use
of the subject property.
6. Ordinance and Plan Purposes. The Variation would not result in a use or
development of the subject property that would not be in harmony with the general
and specific purposes for which this Ordinance, and the provision from which a
Variation is sought, was enacted or the general purpose and intent of the
Comprehensive Plan.
7. No Other Remedy. There is no means other than the requested Variation by which
the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient
to permit a reasonable use of the subject property.
8. Minimum Required. The requested Variation is the minimum measure of relief
necessary to alleviate the alleged hardship or difficulty presented by the strict
application of this Ordinance.
G. Variation Less than Requested
The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend, and the Village Board of Trustees may
grant, Variations less than, or different from, that requested when the record supports the
applicant’s right to some relief but not to the entire relief requested.
H. Conditions on Variations
The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the Village Board of Trustees may
impose such specific conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives
of this Ordinance upon any lot benefited by a Variation as may be necessary or appropriate
to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the
vicinity of the subject lot or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be
expressly set forth in the ordinance or order granting the Variation. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Ordinance and shall constitute grounds
for revocation of the Variation.
I. Effect of Grant of Variation
The grant of a Variation shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor
the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications
for any permits and approvals that may be required by this Ordinance or other ordinances
of the Village.
Chapter 3 – Page 27
J. Limitations on Variations
1. An approved Variation shall automatically expire unless a building permit is issued
and construction has actually begun within one (1) year of issuance. However, the
Village Board of Trustees may extend the one (1) year period to a mutually agreed
upon time.
2. A Variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or
development for which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease to
be of any force or effect if such construction or development is beyond the scope
so authorized.
3.17 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
Applications for Planned Developments shall be reviewed in accordance with Chapter 11 of this
Ordinance.
3.18 APPEALS
A. Establishment and Purpose

Chapter 3 – Page 29
E. Standards
Board of Trustees approval of any amendment, whether text or map, is a matter of
legislative discretion that is not controlled by any one standard. However, in making its
decision, the Board of Trustees shall consider the following factors:

objectives and policies of the Village's Comprehensive Plan (text and map
amendments).

character in the surrounding area (map amendments).
3. The extent to which the proposed amendment adversely impacts adjacent
properties (map amendments).
4. The potential effect of the proposed amendment on the character of future
development if applied generally to other uses in the zoning district or within the
Village as a whole (text amendments).
5. The extent to which the proposed amendment creates nonconformities (text
amendments).
6. The adequacy of public facilities and services to serve the subject property
including, but not limited to, streets, utilities, parks, and police and fire service
(map amendments).
7. The extent to which the proposed amendment is consistent with the overall
structure and organization of this Ordinance (text amendment).
8. The extent to which the proposed text and/or map amendment, if found to be
consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Village’s Comprehensive
Plan, will also further the Village’s specific goal of maintaining and/or increasing
the retail sales tax base of the Village.
F. Parties Entitled to Seek Amendments
Parties entitled to apply for amendments shall be limited to the property owner, agent of
the property owner, or the contract purchaser of the subject property, acting with the
consent of the property owner, or the Village, or other unit of local government.

c. Whenever possible, the highest point of any roof-mounted antenna, including
mounting structure, shall not be higher than the highest point of the roof upon
which the antenna is to be mounted. If it is necessary, due to building design or
other factors, for the antenna to exceed the highest point of the roof structure, the
highest point of the antenna shall not exceed the highest point of the roof by
more than ten (10) feet. The antenna shall be screened from view on all sides, in
a manner consistent with the architectural style of the building.
d. No antenna shall be installed which produces a flat-plane load of greater than two
thousand one hundred (2,100) pounds of resistance in an eighty (80) mile per
hour wind.
e. No antenna shall be attached to or supported by a chimney which creates more
than seventy (70) pounds of resistance to winds having a velocity of eighty (80)
miles per hour except as provided in this Section.

mounting and foundation structure will withstand torque loading on the
antenna in one hundred (100) mile per hour winds.
b. The installation of an antenna will be such as to minimize its overall visibility
from neighboring properties and public ways during all seasons of the year. In
order to minimize the visibility of ground-mounted antennas, the Architectural
Review Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals and Village Board may require that
a natural screen or fence be erected. The natural screen shall be a minimum of
four (4) feet tall, with the plantings spaced two (2) to three (3) feet apart. If a
fence is required, it shall also be a minimum of four (4) tall. However, any
required screening shall not interfere with the antenna’s ability to send and/or
receive signals.
c. No antenna shall be installed which produces a flat-plane load of greater than two
thousand one hundred (2,100) pounds of resistance in an eighty (80) mile per
hour wind.

4.9 SITE LIGHTING
A. Intent
Exterior lighting is regulated to eliminate spill-over and glare on adjacent properties, motor
vehicle operators, and pedestrians within the light source’s proximity. Safety considerations are
the basis for these regulations, especially with respect to motor vehicles. In addition, the
regulations are developed to protect against both nuisance and hazard aspects of glare or excess
light.
B. Applicability
This Section shall apply to all uses except the following:
1. Public street lighting shall conform to standards set by the State Department of
Transportation, Lake and Cook County Departments of Transportation, and the Village of
Barrington Public Works Department.
2. Residential uses are permitted to use low-intensity {forty (40) watts or less per bulb}
incandescent or fluorescent lighting mounted on the buildings or as landscape or entrance
accents. Any high-intensity {more than forty (40) watts per bulb} incandescent,
fluorescent, mercury vapor, metal halide or high pressure sodium lighting shall be
prohibited on residential property unless a lighting plan is submitted and approved, per
Subsection C. below.
3. Holiday lighting under five (5) watts per bulb.
4. Residential lighting that has a light level of one-half (1/2) foot-candle or less at the
property line.
C. Exterior Lighting Plan
Any time exterior lighting is installed or substantially modified, and whenever a site undergoes
site plan review, a lighting plan shall be required. The exterior lighting plan shall consist of the
following information:
1. Photometric plan which shows proposed intensity of illumination in foot-candle values
distributed across the entire site in a grid-like fashion. This grid shall be overlaid on the
site plan.
2. Proposed lighting fixture details which show the height, design, method of shielding and
proposed candlepower of the light source.
D. Lighting Standards Applying to All Light Sources
The following standards are required of all exterior lighting:
1. All cut-off light fixtures shall be designed with a hood that shields the light source and is
directed downwards at all times.
2. No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted, other than holiday lighting exempted
under Section 4.9(B)(3).
3. Flood lights are not permitted in front yards.
4. Lighting levels shall be measured in foot-candles with a direct-reading, portable light
meter. Readings shall be taken at heights between six (6) feet above the ground and six
(6) inches above the ground, at a position facing the light source. Readings shall be taken
only after the meter has been exposed long enough to provide a constant reading.
Measurements shall be made after dark with the light sources in question in operation,
and then turned off. The difference between the two (2) readings shall be compared to
Chapter 4 (Part I) - Page 22
the maximum permitted illumination. This procedure eliminates the effects of moonlight
and other ambient light.
5. The Zoning Official may require cut-off shielding beyond the amount necessary to meet
property line foot candle maximum limits, in order to reduce point source nuisances.
E. Standards for Building Mounted Lights
Building mounted lights shall be cut-off. The light sources shall be hooded and directed
downward at all times. Non-shielded light sources shall only be permitted for security purposes,
provided that illumination at the nearest property line(s) does not exceed the maximum permitted
under 4.9(F)(1)(a) and 4.9(F)(1)(b) below.
F. Standards for Pole Lights
The maximum permitted light pole height is dependent upon the amount of cut-off provided in
order to minimize glare onto adjacent properties and the public right-of-way.
1. When the light source has no cut-off:
a. Maximum permitted illumination as measured at property lines abutting
residential districts shall be one-quarter (0.25) footcandle.
b. Maximum permitted illumination as measured at property lines abutting
nonresidential districts or the public right-of-way shall be one-half (0.50)
footcandle.
c. Maximum permitted pole height shall be ten (10) feet. (See Figure 4.9-A).
Figure 4.9-A No Cut-Off Light Source
2. When the light source has total cut-off of an angle greater than, or equal to, ninety (90)
degrees:
a. Maximum permitted illumination as measured at property lines abutting
residential districts shall be one-half (0.50) footcandles.
b. Maximum permitted illumination as measured at property lines abutting
nonresidential districts or the public right-of-way shall be one (1) footcandle.
c. Maximum permitted pole height shall be fifteen (15) feet. (See Figure 4.9-B)
Chapter 4 (Part I) - Page 23
Figure 4.9-B 90 Degree Light Source
3. When a light source has a total cut-off of an angle less than ninety (90) degrees and the
light source is completely shielded from the direct view of an observer at a point five (5)
feet above the ground, at the point where the cut-off angle intersects the ground:
a. Maximum permitted illumination as measured at property lines abutting
residential and nonresidential districts or the public right-of-way shall be one (1)
footcandle.
b. Maximum permitted pole height shall be twenty (20) feet. (See Figure 4.9-C)
Figure 4.9-C Light Source with Less than 90 Degree Cut-Off
4.10 DEMOLITION
A. Intent

Chapter 4 (Part II) - Page 7
B. Access
Each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway in such a
width and design as set forth below to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to
such parking space. The full width of an alley, but no portion of a street, may be used in
computing such aisle or access area. All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley.
1. Except at Single-Family residences, parking facilities shall be designed so that vehicle
ingress and egress is by forward motion of the vehicle.
2. Where entry/exit is not controlled, provide a minimum of one entry lane and one exit
lane for every five-hundred (500) parking spaces.
3. Where entry is controlled by gates and/or parking access/revenue control procedures,
adequate queuing space (as documented by a queuing analysis prepared by a qualified
traffic engineer or parking consultant) shall be provided so that vehicles will not
queue for entry into the parking facility into any public right of way, nor across any
public or private pedestrian sidewalk or designated path of travel.
4. Adequate sight distances for recognition of pedestrians on sidewalks or designated
pedestrian paths and for recognition of traffic conditions on street shall be provided
for vehicles entering or exiting the facilities.
5. “Stacked”, “buddy” or “tandem” parking spaces are not acceptable to satisfy off-street
parking space requirements; and all such required off-street parking spaces shall be
immediately accessible from a drive aisle except for (1) attended valet parking; or (2)
ground-level vehicle storage areas for approved Automobile Sales facilities.
6. Ramps and Access Roadways.
Straight non-parking roadways, lanes and ramps shall be eleven (11) feet zero (0)
inches wide, with an additional two (2) feet of clearance on both sides to walls or
obstructions (such as light or sign poles, landscaping, etc). Parking control equipment
lanes shall have a minimum clear width of nine (9) feet six (6) inches. Curved
segments of non-parking roadways, lanes and ramps shall have a minimum radius of
the inside curb of fifteen (15) feet and a width of thirteen (13) feet six (6) inches for a
single lane or the inside lane of a two lane roadway, and a minimum width of eleven
(11) feet zero (0) inches for the outside lane, plus two (2) feet of additional clearance
to walls or obstructions on both sides.
7. Circulation.
Vehicular/pedestrian conflicts shall be minimized by providing driving aisles in the
preferred direction of pedestrian flow from parking area to destination; where this
orientation is not feasible, designated crosswalks shall be provided across driving
aisles, rather than encouraging pedestrians to walk between parked vehicles.
C. Location
Off-street parking spaces may be provided on surface lots, underground, under a building, or
in parking structures. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent the parking of vehicles
on driveways, which may cross through a required front yard in those districts.
Chapter 4 (Part II) - Page 8
D. Surfacing and Striping
All off-street parking areas, including around the perimeter and interior landscaped islands,
and access driveways shall be fully improved with a hard surface pavement as required by the
Village Building Code. Striping of the surface to define each parking space shall be provided
and visible at all times, except for single- and two-family residences.
E. Slope
No area of any parking lot or structure, other than a parking lot or structure accessory to a
single-family or two-family dwelling, excluding access ramps, shall have a slope in excess of
six (6) percent.
A minimum slope of one (1) percent, with two (2) percent preferred, shall be provided for
drainage to grate inlets, catch basins or curb inlets. Drainage shall be in compliance with
Village of Barrington stormwater management regulations.
Ramps or slopes in parking areas shall not exceed six (6) percent, with five (5) percent
preferred. Parking control equipment lanes shall not be placed on any slope exceeding three
(3) percent. Ramps or slopes in non-parking areas, but not providing access thereto, shall not
exceed fourteen (14) percent slope, with ten (10) percent slope preferred. Where the slope of
a ramp serving passenger vehicle parking areas exceeds ten (10) percent, transition slopes
shall be provided at both ends, at one-half the main slope and with a minimum length of
twelve (12) feet. For ramps serving Commercial Vehicles, including but not limited to buses
and single-unit or semi-trailer trucks, the slope shall not exceed six (6) percent. Where an exit
ramp terminates at or near a property line, a public or private walk or a designated pedestrian
pathway, an additional transition space of twenty (20) feet at a maximum slope of three (3)
percent shall be provided to allow driver and pedestrian recognition.
F. Landscaping
Except for single- and two-family residences, for all parking areas, regardless of size, a four
(4) foot landscaped divider strip shall be placed between all public sidewalks and parking
areas. Additional landscape requirements for off-street parking and off-street loading areas
are provided in Chapter 4, Part III (Landscape and Tree Preservation Regulations). Metal
parking barriers are prohibited.
G. Illumination
All off-street parking lots or parking structures shall be illuminated, except for single- and
two-family residences and existing multi-family developments without illumination. The
level of illumination at any point in the parking lot or structure shall not be less than one (1)
foot-candle measured at the pavement. All lighting used shall be shielded or otherwise
optically controlled so as to provide non-glare illumination in a manner that does not create a
nuisance on adjacent property. All lighting shall be compliant with the regulations as
provided in Section 4.9 (Site Lighting).
H. Use
No motor vehicle repair work shall be permitted in conjunction with or upon open parking
facilities, except that emergency repairs and on-site oil change services are exempt.

long-term lease. If secured by a long-term lease, the use of a parcel for accessory parking shall be bound
by covenants that run with the land, recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Cook or Lake
Counties.
4.10-7 COLLECTIVE / SHARED PARKING
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the collective provision of off-street parking facilities
for two (2) or more uses, subject to the following conditions:
A. A Zoning Certificate for such collective/shared parking use shall be issued pursuant to
Chapter 3 of this Ordinance.
B. The total of such off-street parking spaces, supplied collectively, shall not be less than the
sum of the requirements for the uses separately, except as follows:
1. The total required number of off-street spaces is permitted to be determined by
written administrative decision by the Zoning Official subject to approval by the
Board of Trustees.
2. Where the total required number of off-street spaces is determined by written
administrative decision of the Zoning Official, and approved by the Board of
Trustees, the determination shall apply only to the uses as proposed at the time of
administrative review.
3. Where the total required number of off-street spaces is determined by written
administrative decision, such determination shall no longer apply should a change
of use or an increase in the intensity of use occur.
Chapter 4 (Part II) - Page 1 0
C. All other applicable requirements of this Chapter are met.

2. These regulations may be subject to such further restrictions by other applicable regulations
of the Zoning Ordinance or applicable provisions of the Barrington Village Code.

the beneficial use of the premises upon which such sign may be found, within thirty (30) calendar
days after written notification from the Zoning Official. Upon failure to comply with such notice,
the Zoning Official is authorized to remove and dispose of such sign at the expense of the permit
holder or the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of the premises.
1. Conforming sign: If a structure is vacant for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or longer,
any conforming sign(s) related to its use shall be covered.
2. Nonconforming sign: If a structure is vacant for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or
longer, any nonconforming sign(s) related to its use shall be removed.
D. Removal of Illegal Nonconforming Signs
Any sign that is in violation of these Sign Regulations and is erected after its effective date is
hereby classified as an “illegal nonconforming sign”. Such signs may include signs modified or
enlarged after initially erected, signs not erected in compliance with the permit or the display of
nonconforming signs that do not require a permit. Whenever the Zoning Official determines that an
illegal nonconforming sign exists, he shall notify the person displaying such sign by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. Such person shall, within ten (10) calendar days, either
remove the sign or initiate such action as is necessary to cause the sign to comply with these Sign

period shall be suspended during the time any application for a permit, or any appeal from the
notice, or any application for a variation is pending.
E. Penalty for Display of Nonconforming Signs
Any person who displays a sign subject to amortization after the end of the applicable period set
forth in the amortization schedule, and any person who displays a nonconforming sign after the end
of the applicable period following the receipt of a notice of nonconformity, shall be subject to a
penalty as established in Section 3.20 of the Zoning Ordinance.
F. Maintenance; Damage to Nonconforming Signs
Normal maintenance of signs, including necessary non-structural and non-electrical repairs and
incidental alterations which do not extend or intensify the non-conforming features of the sign, is
permitted during any amortization period or the period in which permit applications are pending.
However, no structural alterations, enlargement or extensions nor any electrical modifications shall
be made to a sign unless the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconforming features of the
sign. If a sign is damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of thirty (30) percent of its
Chapter 4 (Part IV), Page - 31
replacement value, the sign may not be rebuilt or used thereafter unless it conforms to all of the
provisions of these Sign Regulations.
G. Change of Use or Name of Occupant to Nonconforming Signs

Signs: Appendix A - Munsell Color System
The Munsell System
The Munsell color-order system is a precise way of specifying colors and showing the relationships among
colors. The Munsell color-order system is applicable to all possible colors. Every color has three attributes:
hue, value and chroma. The Munsell system establishes numerical scales with visually uniform steps for each
of these attributes. The Munsell Book of Color displays a collection of colored chips arranged according to
these scales. Each chip is identified numerically using these scales. The color of any surface can be identified
by comparing it to the chips, under proper illumination and viewing conditions. The color is then identified by
its hue, value and chroma. These attributes are given the symbols H, V, and C and are written in a form “H
V/C”, which is called the Munsell notation.
Hue
Hue is that attribute of a color by which we distinguish red from green, blue from yellow, etc. There is a natural
order of hues: red, yellow, green, blue, purple. One can mix paints of adjacent colors and obtain a continuous
variation from one color to the other. The series of hues from red to purple returns to its starting point, so it can
be arranged in a circle.
Munsell called red, yellow, green, blue and purple “principal hues” and placed them at equal intervals around
the “color circle”. He inserted five “intermediate hues”: Yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue,
and red-purple, making ten hues in all. For simplicity, the Munsell Color System uses the initials as symbols to
designate the ten hue sectors: R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P and RP.
The Munsell color system arbitrarily divides the hue circle into 100 steps, of equal visual change in hue, with
the zero point at the beginning of the red sector. Hue may be identified by a number from 0 to 100. However,
the meaning is more obvious when the hue is identified by the hue sector and a step, based on a scale of ten,
within that sector. For example, the hue in the middle of the red sector is called “five red”, and is written “5R”.
(The zero step is not used, so there is a 10R hue, but no 0 YR.)
Value
Value indicates the lightness of a color. The scale of value ranges from 0 for pure black to 10 for pure white.
Black, white, and the grays between them are called “neutral colors”. They have no hue. The colors that do
have hue are called “chromatic colors”. The value scale applies to both neutral and chromatic colors.
Chroma
Chroma is the degree of departure of a color from the neutral color of the same value. Colors of low chroma are
sometimes called “weak”, while those of high chroma are said to be “highly saturated”, “strong”, or “vivid”. If
you started with a gray paint and vivid yellow paint of the same value, and gradually added the yellow to the
gray, until the yellow color was obtained, you would develop a series of gradually changing colors that increase
in chroma.
The Munsell scaling of chroma is intended to be visually uniform, and is nearly so. The units are arbitrary. The
scale starts at zero, for neutral colors, but there is no arbitrary end to the scale. The chroma scale for normal
reflecting materials extends beyond 20 in some cases. Fluorescent materials may have chromas as high as 30.
More Information
A copy of the Munsell Book of Color is available for reference viewing at the Development Services
Department, at the Barrington Village Hall. To obtain more information on the Munsell system, or to order
materials, see the web sites “The Munsell System of Color Notation”, “Munsell Color Chart” or “Munsell
Specialty Color Charts”.`

In the R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6 and R-7 Districts, when lots comprising forty (40) percent or more of the
frontage between two (2) intersecting streets are developed, the average of such front yards may be
used to establish the minimum front yard setback for the entire frontage. The minimum front yard
setback may be established at the average front yard setback as described above or the minimum
front yard setback for the applicable Zoning District contained herein, whichever is less. It shall be
the responsibility of the property owner to provide accurate documentation in the form of a stamped
survey documenting the front yard setback for all applicable lots as described above. This section
does not apply to properties subject to a planned development ordinance or plat of subdivision that
establishes the applicable lot setbacks.
B. Special Setback Requirement Along Certain Streets
1. Northwest Highway Setback: Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Chapter 6, all

Highway, provided that parking shall be set back not less than eight (8) feet from the rightof-
way.
2. Barrington Road (South of Cornell Avenue) Setback: Notwithstanding the other provisions
of this Chapter 6, all property zoned residential shall maintain a one hundred (100) foot
setback along Barrington Road.
C. Floor Area Ratio Requirement
All single-family and two-family buildings, and their accessory structures, shall conform to the
following requirements. No building shall be erected, constructed, or altered on any lot if, as a result
of such erection, construction or alteration, the gross floor area of such building exceeds the
maximum permitted gross floor area for that lot as determined by the applicable computation set
forth below:
Chapter 6, Page - 2
1. The maximum gross floor area for any lot of less than or equal to ten thousand (10,000)
square feet shall be computed as follows:
.5 x lot size in square feet
2. The maximum gross floor area for any lot of more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet,
but less than or equal to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet, shall be computed as follows:
5000 + (.3 x total square feet of lot in excess of 10,000)
3. The maximum gross floor area for any lot of more than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet
shall be computed as follows:
8000 + (.1 x total square feet of lot size in excess of 20,000)
4. Any portion of a deck which is not covered and unenclosed shall not be included in the gross
floor area, provided they are not located above the first story level.
5. Basements shall not be included in the gross floor area, provided the height to the underside
of the ceiling joist is four (4) feet or less above grade. The gross floor area for basements
having a height to the underside of the ceiling joists of greater than four (4) feet above grade
at the highest point shall be computed on a prorated basis as follows:
a. Greater than 4 feet above grade to 7 feet above grade: 0.25 x basement floor area
b. Greater than 7 feet above grade: 0.50 x basement floor area
6. Attic space, whether finished or unfinished, shall not be included in the gross floor area,
provided such attic space is located wholly between the ceiling joists of the top story and the
roof rafters without the presence of knee walls or dormers. Attic space not meeting this
requirement shall be computed as follows:
a. Attic space with a knee wall less than 4 feet in height: 0.50 x attic floor area
b. Attic space with a knee wall 4 feet or greater in height: 1.00 x attic floor area
c. Dormers, whether functional or decorative: 1.00 x dormer floor area
7. Detached accessory structures shall not be included in the gross floor area
D. Daylight Plane Height Restrictions
In addition to the height restrictions set forth in this Chapter 6, all buildings and/or accessory
structures erected, constructed or altered on any lot in a residential district (including but not limited
to the B-R District) shall be subject to, and shall comply with, the daylight plane height restrictions
set forth as follows:
1. Daylight Plane Height Restrictions. Except as provided in Section 6.1(D)(2) below, no
portion of a building and/or accessory structure on a lot shall intercept either of the planes
that begin at points fourteen (14) feet directly above the interior side lot lines and run at
forty-five (45) degree angles toward the interior of the lot until they reach the maximum
height permitted on the lot as provided in this Zoning Ordinance. Measurement of the
fourteen (14) foot vertical portion of the daylight plane shall commence at the average preconstruction
grade level that exists along the portion of the side yard property line adjacent
to the primary side wall of the proposed building and/or accessory structure. If a retaining
wall or other abrupt change in grade exists along the side yard property line, the preconstruction
grade for calculation of the daylight plane shall be the lowest of the grades
Chapter 6, Page - 3
existing on either side of the existing abrupt change. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the

I. Design Standards
Because Barrington is predominantly a single-family community, two-, three- and four-family
development could, in the absence of careful regulation, cause negative impacts on surrounding
neighborhoods. Proper design of such development can eliminate the potential for some of these
impacts. Therefore, the following design standards shall be applied to two-, three- and four-family
new construction and exterior alterations and additions.
All buildings shall be constructed, remodeled or added onto in a manner consistent with traditional
single-family houses in the central part of Barrington. Conformance with the following specific
design standards is required.
Chapter 6, Page - 15
1. Architectural Style. Rigid conformance to specific architectural styles is not required.
However, the exterior design of buildings shall emphasize traditional architectural themes.
"Modern" or "International" styles are not permitted.
2. Exterior Materials General. In order to adapt to changing technology, the development of
new materials, and so as not to limit the designer, additional materials other than those
specified in this Section may be permitted, if recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board. If materials other than those listed below
are proposed for use, such material shall be reviewed and recommended by the Architectural
Review Commission at a preliminary meeting as specified in Section 3.13 of this Ordinance.
Permission to use alternate materials recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board is valid only for the specific project
reviewed. Prior approval and use of a material for another project within the R-7 Residential
District does not grant permission to future projects. The right to use alternate materials
shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in the context of each individual project.
3. Exterior Wall Materials. The materials used on exterior elevations (excluding doors,
windows and roofing materials) shall be limited to:
a. Clay brick (unglazed).
b. Stone (natural).
c. Wood, cementitious or other similar composite siding material.
d. Stucco (cementitious material only, no E.I.F.S. [Exterior Insulation Finish
Systems]).
4. Door & Window Design. All doors and windows shall be residential in character. All doors
and windows with divisions on new construction projects shall utilize simulated divided lites
with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural style of the structure. Replacement
windows in existing buildings should match the existing windows as closely as possible. If
all windows are being replaced in an existing building and divisions are proposed, then
simulated divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural style of the
structure shall be utilized. This section shall not apply to existing single-family residences
within the R-7 District outside of the Historic Overlay District.
5. Door & Window Materials. No restrictions are placed on door and window materials.
6. Exterior Trim.
a. Trim is required for all doors and windows.
b. Trim materials shall be limited to wood, stone, cast stone, molded fiberglass or
molded high density polymer or other similar cementitious or composite material.
c. On masonry buildings, cut stone or pre-cast sills are required for windows; cut stone,
pre-cast, or brick lintels are required for doors and windows. Other trim is not
required.
7. Accent Features. Decorative accent features on exterior walls which are subordinate and
incidental to the design of the façade shall be limited to wood, stone, cast stone, molded
fiberglass or molded high density polymer or other similar cementitious or composite
material.
8. Mixed Materials. Materials may be mixed, provided the placement of materials reflects
traditional use of such materials, as exemplified below:
Chapter 6, Page - 16
a. A wood porch or balcony may be used in combination with stone or brick walls.
b. An extended brick or stone foundation wall may be used in combination with wood
walls.
c. A front façade of finished brick or stone may be used in combination with common
brick on side and rear walls.
d. A one-story room of wood may project from the main two-story portion of the
building made of brick or stone.
e. A fireplace or columns of one material may be combined with walls of another
material.
9. Glazed Surface.
a. At least twenty (20) percent of the front elevation shall be glazed surface; ten (10)
percent of all other elevations shall be glazed surface.
b. Glass shall be clear and non-tinted; no mirrored glass is permitted.
10. Roof Design. A hip, gable or other sloping roof is required. Flat or mansard roofs are not
permitted.
11. Roof Materials. Only shingle roofs of asphalt, fiberglass, wood or slate are permitted.
12. Landscaping. See Chapter 4, Part III for general regulations governing landscaping.
13. Required Plans. Every application for a building permit shall be accompanied by
architectural plans, a site plan and a landscape plan of sufficient detail to show conformance
with these Design Standards. Color schemes and material selection shall be included.
14. Interpretation of Design Standards. A building permit for new construction, an addition or
exterior remodeling in this R-7 District shall not be issued unless a Certificate of Approval
has been issued, in accordance with Section 3.13 of this Ordinance. The Architectural
Review Commission and/or the Village Board may approve the use of alternate materials if
such materials are determined by the Village to be appropriate for the style of building.

I. Design Standards
Because Barrington is predominantly a single-family community, multiple-family and single-family
attached development could, in the absence of careful regulation, cause negative impacts on
surrounding neighborhoods. Proper design of such development can eliminate the potential for some
of these impacts. Therefore, the following design standards shall be applied to multiple-family and
attached single-family development.
All buildings shall be constructed, remodeled or added onto in a manner consistent with traditional
single-family houses in the central part of Barrington. Conformance with the following specific
design standards is required.
1. Architectural Style. Rigid conformance to specific architectural styles is not required.
However, the exterior design of buildings shall emphasize traditional architectural themes.
"Modern" or "International" styles are not permitted.
2. Exterior Materials General. In order to adapt to changing technology, the development of
new materials, and so as not to limit the designer, additional materials other than those
specified in this Section may be permitted, if recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board. If materials other than those listed below
are proposed for use, such material shall be reviewed and recommended by the Architectural
Review Commission at a Preliminary Meeting as specified in Section 3.13 of this Ordinance.
Permission to use alternate materials recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board is valid only for the specific project
reviewed. Prior approval and use of a material for another project within the R-8 General
Residential District does not grant permission to future projects. The right to use alternate
materials shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in the context of each individual project.
3. Exterior Wall Materials. The materials used on exterior elevations (excluding doors,
windows and roofing materials) shall be limited to:
a. Clay brick (unglazed).
b. Stone (natural).
c. Wood, cementitious or other similar composite siding material.
d. Stucco (cementitious material only, no E.I.F.S. [Exterior Insulation Finish
Systems]).
4. Door and Window Design. All doors and windows shall be residential in character. All
doors and windows with divisions on new construction projects shall utilize simulated
divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural style of the structure.
Replacement windows in existing buildings should match the existing windows as closely
as possible. If all windows are being replaced in an existing building and divisions are
Chapter 6, Page - 21
proposed, then simulated divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural
style of the structure shall be utilized. This section shall not apply to existing single-family
residences within the R-8 District outside of the Historic Overlay District.
5. Door and Window Materials. No restrictions are placed on door or window materials.
6. Exterior Trim.
a. Trim is required for all doors and windows.
b. Trim materials shall be limited to wood, stone, cast stone, molded fiberglass or
molded high density polymer or other similar cementitious or composite material.
c. On masonry buildings, cut stone or pre-cast sills are required for windows; cut stone,
pre-cast, or brick lintels are required for doors and windows. Other trim is not
required.
7. Accent Features. Decorative accent features on exterior walls which are subordinate and
incidental to the design of the façade shall be limited to wood, stone, cast stone, molded
fiberglass or molded high density polymer or other similar cementitious or composite
material.
8. Mixed Materials. Materials may be mixed, provided the placement of materials reflects
traditional use of such materials, as exemplified below:
a. A wood porch or balcony may be used in combination with stone or brick walls.
b. An extended brick or stone foundation wall may be used in combination with wood
walls.
c. A front façade of finished brick or stone may be used in combination with common
brick on side and rear walls.
d. A one-story room of wood may project from the main two-story portion of the
building made of brick or stone.
e. A fireplace or columns of one material may be combined with walls of another
material.
9. Glazed Surface.
a. At least twenty (20) percent of the front elevation shall be glazed surface; ten (10)
percent of all other elevations shall be glazed surface.
b. Glass shall be clear and non-tinted; no mirrored glass is permitted.
10. Roof Design. A hip, gable or other sloping roof is required; flat or mansard roofs are not
permitted.
11. Roof Materials. Only shingle roofs of asphalt, fiberglass, wood or slate are permitted.
12. Landscaping. See Chapter 4, Part III for general regulations governing landscaping.
13. Required Plans. Every application for a building permit shall be accompanied by
architectural plans, a site plan and a landscape plan of sufficient detail to show conformance
with these Design Standards. Color schemes and material selection shall be included.
14. Interpretation of Design Standards. A building permit for new construction, an addition or
exterior remodeling in this R-8 District shall not be issued unless a Certificate of Approval
has been issued, in accordance with Section 3.13 of this Ordinance. The Architectural
Chapter 6, Page - 22
Review Commission and/or the Village Board may approve the use of alternate materials if
such materials are determined by the Village to be appropriate for the style of building.
J. Accessory Buildings, Structures and Uses
To maintain the residential character of the R-8 General Residential District, it is necessary to
coordinate accessory uses and structures with the residential architecture of the existing houses
within the district.
1. See Chapter 4, Part I for general regulations governing fencing, antennas and other accessory
buildings, structures and uses. In addition to the general regulations, the following shall
apply:
All accessory structures shall compliment and coordinate with the principal structure on the

2. Refuse Containers.
a. Location. Refuse containers shall be located only in the rear of the building. No
refuse containers shall be located between a building and a corner side or front lot
line.
b. Screening. All dumpsters shall be fully enclosed by walls not less than the height
of the dumpster, provided with gates to contain trash, and provided with a densely
planted evergreen hedge immediately adjacent to the walls. The materials used for
the walls shall complement the architecture of the building, and shall be constructed
of wood, brick or stone.
c. Typical residential trash containers are preferred. In the event that a dumpster is
necessary, shared dumpsters with adjacent properties are encouraged. Non-shared
dumpsters shall be limited to a maximum size of three (3) yards.
3. Ground-Based Mechanical Equipment.
a. All ground-based mechanical equipment including, but not limited to, heating,
ventilating, and air-conditioning units (HVAC), shall be located only in the rear of

from a residential district.
3. See Table 7.10-C. All other buildings.
K. Building Size Regulations
To promote small-scale, pedestrian friendly commercial development, it is necessary to
limit the size of buildings, as established below.
Chapter 7, Page - 14
1. Small Buildings. Buildings not in excess of fifty (50) feet in width and ten
thousand (10,000) square feet in ground coverage shall be permitted, provided they
meet all the other regulations of this District and this Ordinance.
2. Large Buildings. Buildings in excess of fifty (50) feet in width or ten thousand
(10,000) square feet in ground coverage shall be permitted only if they conform to
the following:
a. Each ground floor tenant shall have frontage and a store front door on a
public street, parking area or an access corridor.
b. Façades of large buildings shall be visually broken into bays of no more
than fifty (50) feet in width. Visual breaks in the façade shall be
accomplished by alterations in the plane of the façade, height of the
façade, changes in materials, color, texture, or pattern, and/or the addition
of columns or pilasters.
c. Buildings in excess of seventy-five (75) feet of street frontage width shall
provide a minimum of one (1) rear pedestrian access corridor, which shall
have a minimum width of eight (8) feet.
L. Minimum Building Width
Promoting pedestrian activity requires maintaining a continuous building line and/or
activity area, such as outdoor dining, along the street. Front access drives disrupt the
continuous building line and have a detrimental effect on the pedestrian orientation of the
Village Center. To ensure building line continuity, the width of buildings shall not be less
than eighty (80) percent of the lot width. Buildings on lots less than sixty (60) feet wide
shall have parking access from the rear whenever possible. When such access is not
possible, front access drives shall be limited to twelve (12) feet in width when, in the
determination of the Zoning Official, such access drives do not cause a safety hazard.
M. Demolition
The demolition of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places shall
require Planned Development approval. The Planned Development shall include a
redevelopment plan for the reuse of the subject property.
N. Design Standards
The following design standards, together with the other regulations of this District and of
this Ordinance, are intended to promote a small-scale, pedestrian-friendly character
throughout the B-4 Village Center District. These standards are intended to encourage
creative, tasteful, and scale-appropriate design. The standards have been developed not to
limit the designer, but to avoid that which is gaudy, ordinary or of an inappropriate scale.
The B-4 Village Center District is the center of the community. In order to create and
maintain a sense of place and a cohesive atmosphere within the Village Center, it is
required that all design relate to the context of the Village Center. Architectural design and
scale which do not fit into the context of the Village Center shall not be permitted. The
following regulations shall apply to all new construction, additions and exterior remodeling
in the B-4 Village Center District.
1. Architectural Style. Rigid conformance to specific architectural styles is not
required. However, the exterior design of buildings shall emphasize traditional
Chapter 7, Page - 15
architectural themes consistent with older buildings in the B-4 Village Center
District.
2. Exterior Materials General. In order to adapt to changing technology, the
development of new materials, and so as not to limit the designer, additional
materials other than those specified in this Section may be permitted, if
recommended by the Architectural Review Commission and approved by the
Village Board. If materials other than those listed below are proposed for use, such
material shall be reviewed and recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission at a Preliminary Meeting as specified in Chapter 3 of this Ordinance.
Permission to use alternate materials recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board is valid only for the specific
project reviewed. Prior approval and use of a material for another project within
the B-4 Village Center District does not grant permission to future projects. The
right to use alternate materials shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in the
context of each individual project.
3. Exterior Wall Materials. The materials used on exterior elevations (excluding
doors, windows and roofing materials) shall be limited to:
a. Clay brick (unglazed).
b. Stone (natural).
c. Wood, cementitious or other similar composite siding material.
d. Stucco (cementitious material only, no E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation Finish
Systems)).
4. Door & Window Design. In order to promote and maintain the small town,
historic character of the Village Center, glazed metal curtain wall systems are
discouraged. The majority of glazed surface on façade(s) shall be double hung,
casement, or fixed picture windows, within discernable wall elements. Sliding or
jalousie windows shall not be permitted. All doors and windows with divisions on
new construction projects shall utilize simulated divided lites with an appropriate
pattern to match the architectural style of the structure. Replacement windows in
existing buildings should match the existing windows as closely as possible. If all
windows are being replaced in an existing building and divisions are proposed,
then simulated divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural
style of the structure shall be utilized. This section shall not apply to existing
single-family residences with the B-4 District outside of the Historic Overlay
District.
5. Door & Window Materials. No restrictions are placed on door or window
materials.
6. Exterior Trim.
a. Trim is required for all doors and windows.
b. Trim materials shall be limited to wood, stone, cast stone, molded
fiberglass, molded high density polymer or other similar cementitious or
composite material.
c. On masonry buildings, cut stone or pre-cast sills are required for windows;
cut stone, pre-cast, or brick lintels are required for doors and windows.
Other masonry trim is not required.
Chapter 7, Page - 16

2. See Table 7.10-B. All buildings on lots immediately adjacent to or across the
street from a residential district.
3. See Table 7.10-C. All other buildings.
I. Building Size Regulations
To promote small-scale, pedestrian friendly commercial development, it is necessary to
limit the size of buildings, as established below.
1. Small Buildings. Buildings not in excess of fifty (50) feet in width and ten
thousand (10,000) square feet in ground coverage shall be permitted, provided they
meet all the other regulations of this District and this Ordinance.
2. Large Buildings. Buildings in excess of fifty (50) feet in width or ten thousand
(10,000) square feet in ground coverage shall be permitted only if they conform to
the following:
a. Each ground floor tenant shall have frontage and a store front door on a
public street, parking area or an access corridor.
b. Façades of large buildings shall be visually broken into bays of no more
than fifty (50) feet in width. Visual breaks in the façade shall be
accomplished by alterations in the plane of the façade, height of the
façade, changes in materials, color, texture, or pattern, and/or the addition
of columns or pilasters.
c. Buildings in excess of seventy-five (75) feet of street frontage width shall
provide a minimum of one (1) rear pedestrian access corridor, which shall
have a minimum width of eight (8) feet.
J. Minimum Building Width
Promoting pedestrian activity requires maintaining a continuous building line and/or
activity area, such as outdoor dining, along the street. Front access drives disrupt the
continuous building line and have a detrimental effect on the pedestrian orientation of the
Village Center. To ensure building line continuity, the width of buildings shall not be less
than eighty (80) percent of the lot width. Buildings on lots less than sixty (60) feet wide
shall have parking access from the rear whenever possible. When such access is not
possible, front access drives shall be limited to twelve (12) feet in width when, in the
determination of the Zoning Official, such access drives do not cause a safety hazard.
K. Demolition
The demolition of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places shall
Chapter 7, Page - 24
require Planned Development approval. The Planned Development shall include a
redevelopment plan for the reuse of the subject property.
L. Design Standards
The following design standards, together with the other regulations of this District and of
this Ordinance, are intended to promote a small-scale, pedestrian-friendly character
throughout the B-5 Village Center East District. These standards are intended to
encourage creative, tasteful, and scale-appropriate design. The standards have been
developed not to limit the designer, but to avoid that which is gaudy, ordinary or of an
inappropriate scale. The B-5 Village Center East District is the center of the community.
In order to create and maintain a sense of place and a cohesive atmosphere within the
Village Center, it is required that all design relate to the context of the Village Center.
Architectural design and scale which do not fit into the context of the Village Center shall
not be permitted. The following regulations shall apply to all new construction, additions
and exterior remodeling in the B-5 Village Center East District.
1. Architectural Style. Rigid conformance to specific architectural styles is not
required. However, the exterior design of buildings shall emphasize traditional
architectural themes consistent with older buildings in the B-5 Village Center East
District.
2. Exterior Materials General. In order to adapt to changing technology, the
development of new materials, and so as not to limit the designer, additional
materials other than those specified in this Section may be permitted, if
recommended by the Architectural Review Commission and approved by the
Village Board. If materials other than those listed below are proposed for use,
such material shall be reviewed and recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission at a Preliminary Meeting as specified in Chapter 3 of this Ordinance.
Permission to use alternate materials recommended by the Architectural Review
Commission and approved by the Village Board is valid only for the specific
project reviewed. Prior approval and use of a material for another project within
the B-5 Village Center East District does not grant permission to future projects.
The right to use alternate materials shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in
the context of each individual project.
3. Exterior Wall Materials. The materials used on exterior elevations (excluding
doors, windows and roofing materials) shall be limited to:
a. Clay brick (unglazed).

historic character of the Village Center, glazed metal curtain wall systems are
discouraged. The majority of glazed surface on façade(s) shall be double hung,
casement, or fixed picture windows, within discernable wall elements. Sliding or
jalousie windows shall not be permitted. All doors and windows with divisions on
new construction projects shall utilize simulated divided lites with an appropriate
pattern to match the architectural style of the structure. Replacement windows in
Chapter 7, Page - 25
existing buildings should match the existing windows as closely as possible. If all
windows are being replaced in an existing building and divisions are proposed,
then simulated divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural
style of the structure shall be utilized. This section shall not apply to existing
single-family residences within the B-5 District outside of the Historic Overlay
District.
5. Door & Window Materials. No restrictions are placed on door or window
materials.

the building made of brick or stone.
e. A fireplace or columns of one material may be combined with walls of
another material.
9. Exterior Colors. All colors produced from completely natural materials and
unglazed brick shall be permitted. Colors produced through paint or other material
coatings shall be restricted.
a. Exterior Wall Colors. Excessively bright or dark colors shall be avoided,
and accordingly, the following restrictions shall apply:

O. Off-Street Parking
To maintain the inviting, pedestrian-friendly character of the B-5 Village Center East
District, it is important to coordinate parking areas with the architectural and overall design
themes of the buildings and principal uses within the District. It is the intent that off-street
parking within the District be accessed from the rear of the lot wherever possible. Shared
parking access is strongly encouraged.

shall comply with B-5 Village Center East District design guidelines and
standards, as specified in this Chapter.
c. Any building located within the B-5 Village Center East District which is
totally or partially destroyed by fire, casualty, loss or an act of God, may
be reconstructed to its original size without providing for more parking
spaces than existed prior to such destruction, provided that all other
applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are met. Furthermore,
any building within the B-5 Village Center East District may thereafter be
subject to a change of use or occupancy which is otherwise in accordance
with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, notwithstanding
the requirements for off-street parking as contained in this Zoning
Ordinance, provided, however, that the use or occupancy established by
such change is a permitted use or an approved special use within the B-5
Village Center East District.
2. Off-street parking structures shall conform to the following:
a. The exterior walls of the structure shall be designed and constructed so as to
shield all parked vehicles from view from any adjacent property or street.
b. Every parking structure shall be designed and constructed so that the exterior
facing of the structure is architecturally compatible with the existing character
of the buildings it is intended to serve or, in the case of a principal use parking
structure, with the design guidelines of the Village Center as specified in this
Chapter.
c. Parking structure design shall replicate the regular window pattern and other
architectural elements of adjacent buildings. Exterior walls of accessory
parking structures shall be finished with a material having a common
architectural character with the principal building.

shall be reviewed and recommended by the Architectural Review Commission at a Preliminary Meeting as
specified in Section 3.13 of this Ordinance.
Permission to use alternate materials recommended by the Architectural Review Commission
and approved by the Village Board is valid only for the specific project reviewed. Prior
approval, and use of a material for another project within the B-R Mixed Business-Residential
Overlay District, does not grant permission to future projects. The right to use alternate
materials shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, in the context of each individual project.

and windows with divisions on new construction projects shall utilize simulated divided lites
with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural style of the structure. Replacement
windows in existing buildings should match the existing windows as closely as possible. If all
windows are being replaced in an existing building and divisions are proposed, then simulated
divided lites with an appropriate pattern to match the architectural style of the structure shall
be utilized. This section shall not apply to existing single-family residences within the B-R
District outside of the Historic Overlay District.
5. Door and Window Materials. No restrictions are placed on door or window materials.

plan and a landscape plan of sufficient detail to show conformance with these design standards. Color
schemes and material selection shall be included.
14. Interpretation of Design Standards. A building permit for new construction, an addition or
exterior remodeling in this B-R District shall not be issued unless a Certificate of Approval has
been issued, in accordance with Section 3.13 of this Ordinance. The Architectural Review

Overlay District, the majority of the individual parcels within a proposed district shall meet the standard
of contributing structures or sites, based on the following criteria:
Chapter 9, Page - 13
1. Significance in local, regional, state or national history, architecture, engineering or culture,
associated with at least one (1) of the following:
a. They are associated with events of the lives of persons that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or

d. They have yielded, or are likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
2. Physical integrity of the property in terms of architectural design, setting, materials,
workmanship, character and association as defined by the National Park Service for the
National Register of Historic Places.
3. The Age of the Structure or Site. Contributing structures or sites shall predate 1950 or shall
have achieved exceptional historical or cultural importance or significance.
4. Structures or sites, which do not meet these criteria, constitute non-contributing properties.
5. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance to the contrary, any detached garage(s)
and other detached accessory structure(s) or detached accessory building(s) located within the
H Historic District shall be considered non-contributing.

3. Filing an application for alternative uses if available or feasible, such as conditional uses,
special exceptions, etc.
4. Obtaining written statements from licensed building contractors or architects detailing
the actual costs to rehabilitate the property.
M. Final Decision for Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition Following One (1) Year
Deferral
Upon the completion of the one (1) year period, and if the applicant provides evidence of a bona fide
preservation effort, the Architectural Review Commission shall make a final decision for the Certificate
of Appropriateness for Demolition pursuant to Subsection (F)(4). The Architectural Review
Commission shall approve the Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition with modifications or
deny the Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition for the reuse plans for reuse for new

Upon approval of a Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition of a contributing structure, the
Architectural Review Commission shall require the applicant to provide archival quality photographs,
plans or elevation drawings, as available, necessary to record the structure(s) being demolished.
O. Review of Post-Demolition Plan for New Construction or Landscape Plan and Security
Requirements for Approved Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition
Prior to approval of any Certificate of Appropriateness for Demolition, the Architectural Review
Commission shall review the post-demolition plans to assure that the plans comply with the standards
of Subsection (J) of this Section. The Petitioner shall provide a post-demolition landscape plan and a
Chapter 9, Page - 22
security in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit shall be required to ensure the completion of the
landscape plan approved by the Architectural Review Commission. The design standards and
guidelines for the landscape plan are provided in Chapter 4, Part III.
1. The security shall be issued in a form approved by the Village Attorney. The bond shall be in an
amount determined by the Zoning Official and shall be sufficient to cover the estimated cost, to
restore the grade as required by Chapter 8, Article IV of the Village of Barrington Code and revegetate
and landscape as per the approved plan.
2. The security shall require installation of landscaping within six (6) months, unless the owner has
obtained a building permit and commenced construction of a building or structure on the site.

shall notify the Zoning Official of the decision.
Q. Certificate of Economic Hardship
An Application for a Certificate of Economic Hardship. The determination of economic hardship shall
require the applicant to provide evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the application of the standards

subject property and that demolition of the structure is the only recourse.
1. Application. Any applicant, following a final decision of the Architectural Review Commission
or the Village Board of Trustees, denying a certificate of appropriateness, may, within thirty
(30) days of the denial, make application for a Certificate of Economic Hardship on a form

(5) business days. The Certificate of Economic Hardship for demolition may be subject
to conditions for subsequent construction including compliance with the standards

Appropriateness. The Certificate of Economic Hardship shall be valid for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days from issuance by the Architectural Review

of the Architectural Review Commission shall be final and may be appealed to the
circuit court.
d. If a motion to accept the application for appeal is made and adopted at the meeting of

CHAPTER 10
NONCONFORMITY
10.1 Purpose
10.2 Nonconforming Uses of Land, Buildings or Structures
10.3 Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
10.4 Nonconforming Signs and Landscaping
10.1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish regulations and limitations on the continued existence of
uses, buildings or structures established prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance which do
not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. Many such nonconformities may continue,
but the provisions of this Chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in such
nonconformities and to bring about their eventual elimination, where appropriate, in order to preserve
the integrity of the zoning districts and the regulations established by this Zoning Ordinance.
10.2 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES
A. Authority to Continue
Any lawfully existing nonconforming use (see definition in Chapter 2) of part or all of a
building or structure, or any lawfully existing nonconforming use of land not involving a
building or structure, or involving a building or structure that is accessory to such use of land,
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this
Chapter.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of
nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing may be performed on
any building or structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a nonconforming use. The
repair and/or replacement of an existing nonconforming driveway and/or nonconforming
driveway material shall be permitted provided the existing driveway configuration is not
altered or expanded and the extents of the existing nonconformity are documented by the
Zoning Official’s approval of a driveway permit and related plans.
No structural alterations shall be performed on any building or structure containing a
nonconforming use, except in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law.
2. When the alteration will result in eliminating the nonconforming use.
3. A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses may be altered in
any way to improve livability, provided no structural alteration shall be made which
would increase the number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
C. Expansion
A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in intensity.
Such prohibited activity shall include, but not be limited to:
Chapter 10, Page - 2
1. Expansion of any building or structure devoted entirely to a nonconforming use.
2. Expansion of such use to any building or structure other than that occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or any
amendment hereto which causes such use to become nonconforming.
3. Expansion of such use within a building or structure to any portion of the floor
area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment hereto which causes such use to
become nonconforming.
4. Operation of such nonconforming use in such a manner as to conflict with, or to
further conflict with, any performance standards established for the district in
which such use is located.
D. Relocation
No building or structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a nonconforming use shall be
relocated (whether in whole, or in part) to any other location on the same or any other lot,
unless the entire building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the
regulations of the zoning district in which such building or structure and use are located after
being so relocated. No nonconforming use of land shall be relocated (whether in whole, or in
part) to any other location on the same, or any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter
conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which such use of land is located after
being so relocated.
E. Change in Use
A nonconforming use of land, or of a building or structure, shall not be changed to any use
other than a use permitted in the zoning district in which such land, building or structure is
located. When such nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall only be
used thereafter for a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located. For the
purpose of this Chapter, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and the permitted use shall have commenced
and continued for a period of seven (7) consecutive days.
F. Abandonment or Discontinuance
When a nonconforming use of part or all of land, or a building or structure, is abandoned or
discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months (regardless of any reservation of
an intent not to abandon and to resume such use), such use shall not thereafter be reestablished
or resumed. However, existing structures located in a single-family residential
zoning district that are divided into two-family dwelling units, three- and four-family
dwelling units or other multiple family dwelling units shall be permitted to remain provided
the existing nonconformity is not expanded. Any subsequent use of such land, building or
structure shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land, building
or structure is located.
G. Damage and/or Destruction
In the event that any building or structure that is devoted in whole, or in part, to a
nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means outside of one’s control, to the
extent of fifty (50) percent or more of the fair market value of such building or structure
immediately prior to such event, such building or structure shall not be restored unless such
Chapter 10, Page - 3
building or structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulation of the
zoning district in which such building or structure and use are located. When such building
or structure is damaged and/or destroyed to the extent of less than fifty (50) percent of the fair
market value of such building or structure immediately prior to such damage and/or
destruction, such building or structure may be reconstructed and/or repaired and then used for
the same purposes as it was before the damage and/or destruction, provided that such repair
or reconstruction is completed within twelve (12) months of the occurrence of the damage
and/or destruction.
H. Amortization
The nonconforming uses listed below may continue for a period of time, as proscribed below,
from the date of formal notification by the Village of Barrington of the initiation of the
amortization period. Upon conclusion of the amortization period, every such nonconforming
use duly notified shall cease to operate on the premises and all equipment and material
specific to the operation of the nonconforming use shall be completely removed from the
premises. From thence forward, any use of the premises shall conform to all the requirements
of this Ordinance.
1. Nonconforming Uses to be Terminated Within Five (5) Years of Notification. For
any nonconforming building or structure having a current assessed valuation of not in
excess of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars , the termination of such nonconforming
building, structure, and/or use shall occur not later than five (5) years from the date
the notification of such amortization requirement is sent by the Village by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the property owner.
2. Nonconforming Uses to be Terminated Within Two (2) Years of Notification. For

10.3 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES
A. Authority to Continue
Any existing nonconforming building (see definition in Chapter 2) or structure that is devoted
to a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which such building or structure is located
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this
Chapter.
B. Enlargement, Repair and Alterations
1. Any existing nonconforming building or structure may be enlarged, maintained,
repaired or altered but only if such enlargement, maintenance, repair or alteration
shall not create either an additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the
existing nonconformity of all, or any part, of such building or structure, and only if
such addition or alteration complies with all other applicable provisions of the
Zoning District in which the subject property is located.
2. If an existing structure was legally constructed under a previously approved Zoning
Ordinance with a side yard, front yard or rear yard which is less than is now required,
an addition to such structure which constitutes an extension of the existing side, front
or rear wall in, within, and/or inside of the same plane as the existing side, front or
rear wall, whether in, within, and/or inside of a horizontal and/or vertical extension of
the plane, shall be permitted, but only if such such additional or alteration complies
with all other provisions of the applicable Zoning District in which the subject
property is located.
a. This Section 10.3-B.2 is intended to allow an addition or alteration to an
existing building or structure to be constructed in the same plane as the
existing building or structure.
b. The intentional destruction or demolition of a nonconforming building or
structure to allow all or part of a nonconforming building or structure to be
rebuilt with nonconforming setbacks is prohibited.
c. The preservation of just a small or nominal portion of a nonconforming
building or structure, as determined by the Zoning Official, shall not allow
the use of any nonconforming setbacks of a pre-existing building or structure
to be utilized for the building or construction of a building or structure, rather
than the currently applicable setbacks of the Zoning District for such a
building or structure.
d. The preservation of only one or more foundation wall(s) and/or the wall
framing of one or more wall(s) in combination with demolition of a
substantial portion of the interior of a building or structure shall not qualify
for the provisions of this Section 10.3-B.2 and would require a zoning
variance to retain and/or extend the original building or structure setbacks.
e. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.3-B to the contrary, expansion
in, within, and/or inside of the same plane as the existing side, front or rear
wall, whether horizontal and/or vertical, of an existing building or structure,
may extend up to an additional one foot (1’) beyond the already existing
encroachment but only if the side, front or rear plane of the structure is not
exactly parallel to the side, front or rear property line or if new siding
material is greater in depth than the existing materials.
Chapter 10, Page - 5
f. A new or existing deck or porch may be extended in the same plane as the
existing nonconforming wall. A new or existing front porch may be repaired
or extended in the same horizontal plane as the existing front porch, but not
beyond such horizontal plane, provided such extension complies with all
other applicable provisions of the Zoning District in which the subject
property is located.

market value of such building or structure immediately prior to such event, such building or
structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to all regulation of the zoning
district in which such building or structure is located. When such building or structure is
damaged and/or destroyed to the extent of less than (50) fifty percent of the fair market value
of such building or structure immediately prior to such damage and/or destruction, such
building or structure may be reconstructed and/or repaired, provided that such reconstruction
and/or repair is completed within twelve (12) months of the occurrence of the damage and/or

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
11.1 PURPOSE
11.2 INTENT
11.3 PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK PLANNED DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL
11.4 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED
11.5 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
11.6 PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS FROM DISTRICT REGULATIONS
11.7 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURE
11.8 SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
11.1 PURPOSE
Planned Development regulations allow for development of innovative and environmentally sensitive
design by allowing a degree of flexibility in the strict application of the zoning district regulations. A
Planned Development is a Special Use, which may be granted by the Village Board should it determine
that the Planned Development is in the best interest of the Village, is substantially consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan and its defined Neighborhoods, and would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to
this Ordinance.
The Plan Commission and Village Board may require any condition or design consideration that will
promote proper development or benefit the community. In exchange for the flexibility permitted under
this Chapter, the Planned Development should provide amenities not otherwise required by this
Ordinance and establish facilities and open space greater than the minimum required by this Ordinance.
It is not intended that the Village Board automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density
premiums in the case of each Planned Development. The Plan Commission shall recommend and the
Village Board shall grant only such premiums or latitudes that are consistent with sound land use
planning, Village growth policy, accrue benefits to the Village, and which are consistent with the
character of the Village of Barrington.
As a condition of approval, each Planned Development shall be compatible with the character and
objectives of the underlying zoning district or districts within which it is located, and each Planned
Development shall be consistent with the official planning policies of the Village of Barrington. As
specified in this Ordinance, Planned Developments shall be Special Uses.
11.2 INTENT
The intent of the Planned Development option is to:
A. Afford greater choice in the types of development available to the public by allowing
a development that would not be possible under the strict application of the other
requirements of this Ordinance.
B. Allow for a more creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
that results in better development, design, and the construction of amenities and
protection of environmentally sensitive areas.
Chapter 11, Page - 2
C. Promote the preservation of, and where appropriate, public access to open space and
provide more usable and suitably located recreation areas and facilities.
D. Encourage a pattern of development to preserve natural resources and vistas,
topographic and geographic features, and architectural and historic landmarks.
E. Permit an efficient use of land resulting in more economic networks of utilities, streets,
schools, public grounds, and buildings, and other facilities; and
F. To encourage the use of land which promotes the public health, safety, and welfare.
11.3 PARTIES ENTITLED TO SEEK PLANNED DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL
An application for a Special Use permit to allow a Planned Development may be filed by the owner of,
or by any person having a substantial contractual interest in, the subject property, or by a unit of local
government, even when the unit of local government does not own or have a substantial contractual
interest in the subject property, provided that the unit of local government is a petitioner or a copetitioner
for the subject property. The Village Board may also designate areas within the Village
through the application of the P-D Planned Development Overlay District where development
proposals would be subject to review as Planned Developments.
11.4 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT REQUIRED
A. Any development or redevelopment of property requiring three (3) or more exceptions
from the Zoning Ordinance shall require Planned Development approval.
B. The demolition of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places shall
require Planned Development approval in the B-4, B-5 and B-R Districts. The Planned
Development shall include a redevelopment plan for the reuse of the subject property.
11.5 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES
The following guidelines will be used by the Architectural Review Commission, Plan Commission and
the Village Board to evaluate the suitability of proposed Planned Developments. These guidelines
represent sound planning principles which should be incorporated into Planned Developments.
However, it is not intended that each and every one of these guidelines be rigidly conformed to,
provided that just cause for any departure from these guidelines is demonstrated.
A. The Planned Development shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance, as stated in Chapter 1.
B. The Planned Development shall be compatible with the character of the underlying
zoning district and Neighborhood in which it is located.
C. The Planned Development should be consistent with the official planning policies and
the Village Comprehensive Plan.
D. The Planned Development should preserve the value of the surrounding residential
area.
Chapter 11, Page - 3
E. Significant physical, topographical, environmentally sensitive or historical features of
the site of the Planned Development, which are of importance to the community,
should be preserved.
F. The entire property proposed for Planned Development treatment shall be in single
ownership or under such unified control, or the petition shall include a unit of local
government as a petitioner or as a co-petitioner, so as to ensure that the entire property
will ultimately be developed as a unified whole. All owners of the subject property
shall be included as joint applicants on all applications and all approvals shall bind all
owners, except that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a unit of local
government may petition for property which it does not own provided the unit of local
government is a co-petitioner. Parties entitled to apply for a Special Use permit shall
be limited to the property owner, agent of the property owner, or the contract purchaser
of subject property, acting with the consent of the property owner, or the Village, or
another unit of local government. The violation of any owner as to any lot shall be
deemed a violation as to all owners and all lots.
G. In business districts, the Planned Development shall be consistent with the Village’s
specific goal of maintaining and/or increasing the retail sales tax base of the Village.
Conversion of an existing use or uses which generate retail sales tax to a Planned
Development use or uses which do not generate retail sales tax has an adverse effect
on the retail sales tax base of the Village. Where a Planned Development which does
not generate retail sales tax is proposed on a site currently or most recently occupied
by a retail sales tax generating use or uses, substantial evidence shall be provided that
the benefits to the community provided by the proposed use are greater than the
benefits provided by a use or uses which generate retail sales tax on the site. A first
floor Planned Development use or uses which do not generate retail sales tax proposed
within the B-1 or B-4 zoning districts as part of larger retail developments shall
constitute no more than 20% of the first floor area unless substantial evidence is
provided that the use of more than 20% of the first floor area as a use or uses which do
not generate retail sales tax is instrumental in allowing the larger retail development to
go forward or otherwise enhances in some substantial manner the retail sales tax base
of the Village.
11.6 PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS FROM THE ZONING ORDINANCE
Exceptions from Zoning Ordinance regulations shall solely be for the purpose of promoting better
development that will be beneficial to the residents or occupants of the Planned Development, as well
as those of surrounding properties. To achieve the intended benefits of the Planned Development,
exceptions from the regulations of the underlying district may be authorized as follows.
A. Exceptions from Use Regulations, Bulk Intensity, Landscaping, Parking, Signage
and Architectural Design Guidelines
1. Proposed exceptions shall enhance the quality of the Planned Development and shall
be compatible with the primary uses of the property.
2. Proposed exceptions shall not be of a nature, nor located so as to create a detrimental
influence on the surrounding properties.
3. Proposed exceptions shall not cover more than forty (40) percent of the site area or
more than forty (40) percent of the total floor area, whichever is less. However, in a
Chapter 11, Page - 4
residential Planned Development, no more than ten (10) percent of the site area or total
floor area, whichever is less, shall be devoted to business use, and provided that such
business use is integral to the nature of the Planned Development
4. In residential Planned Developments, the maximum number of dwelling units
permitted shall not exceed more than twenty-five (25) percent that is permitted in the
underlying district.
5. In a residential Planned Development, common open space shall not be less than sixty
(60) percent of the net site area, except in the B-4 Village Center District or B-5 Village
Center East District. In all other Planned Developments, common open space shall not
be less than fifty (50) percent of the net site area, except in the B-4 Village Center
District or B-5 Village Center East District, or unless otherwise indicated in the
Village’s Comprehensive Plan or Development Regulations. Common open space
may include amenities such as public or private golf courses, public plazas, passive
parks, open space not within a lot, and natural site features such as lakes, ponds, and
wetlands. All such areas whether privately owned, owned by a property owners
association, protected by an open space easement, or to be dedicated to the Village,
shall be considered in calculating the total amount of common open space.
6. All planned developments in the B-4 Village Center District or B-5 Village Center East
District shall include an open space or public gathering space element appropriate to
the use and scale of the project.
7. Along the periphery of such Planned Developments, yards shall be provided as
required by the regulations of the underlying zoning district.
8. The Village Board may, as a part of the Planned Development approval, grant, impose,
modify and/or waive any conditions and/or requirements listed in Section 11.6-A of
this Chapter.
.
B. Exceptions from Standards in Other Village Ordinances.
The Village Board may, as part of the Planned Development approval, grant exceptions from
the standards and requirements of other Village ordinances, including but not limited to the
Development Regulations, the Building Code, or the Watershed Development Ordinance.

such proposed final plan. If such final plan is disapproved, then within a reasonable
time thereafter, the Village shall furnish to the developer a written statement setting
forth the reason for disapproval and specifying with particularity the aspects in which
the proposed plan fails to comply with the applicable ordinances of the Village. Within
a reasonable period of time after it has received both such recommendations, the
Village Board shall either (1) approve the final plan, with or without modifications
and conditions which modifications shall be accepted in writing by the applicant as
condition(s) of such approval or, (2) reject the final plan and refer the final plan back

streetscape, and to provide for adequate planting, safe pedestrian
movement, and parking areas.
ii. Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning
restrictions is encouraged to provide an interesting relationship between
buildings.
iii. Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building wall
extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means so as to largely
screen parking areas from view from public ways.
iv. Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning
district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its
site and existing (or allowed) adjoining buildings.
v. Newly installed utility services, and service revisions necessitated by
exterior alteration, shall be underground.
b. RELATIONSHIP OF BUILDINGS AND SITE TO ADJOINING AREA

SECTION 3: Section V “DESIGN STANDARDS” of the Subdivision Regulations of the
Official Comprehensive Plan of the Village of Barrington is hereby amended by adding thereto,
after the end of subsection “G.”, a new subsection “H.” as follows:
“H. Tree Preservation. It shall be the stated public policy of the Village of
Barrington to preserve and maintain, to the greatest extent possible, existing trees and
significant vegetation within the Village.
To achieve this goal, all proposed developments that are greater than or equal to one-half
(1/2) acre in size shall be required to provide for the preservation of Key Trees, Significant
Trees, and Significant Vegetation as identified during the preparation of the required
environmental studies and site development plans. All Key Trees, Significant Trees and
Significant Vegetation must be clearly identified within the required inventory and shown
on all subdivision engineering and site development plans. All Key Trees, seventy (70)
percent of the Significant Trees, and sixty (60) percent of the Significant Vegetation shall
be preserved.
If special circumstances of an individual site dictate, the applicant may request a review
from the Village Manager or his or her designee. Based on this review, the Village
Manager or his or her designee may grant relief from the preservation requirements for
Key Trees, Significant Trees and Significant Vegetation, up to but not exceeding the (10)
percent. Any Key Trees, Significant Trees or Significant Vegetation shall be replaced at
the following ratio:
Key Tree: Two inches of replacement for every one inch of removal. The
minimum size for replacement trees shall be six (6) inches in caliper.
Significant Tree: Two inches of replacement for every one inch of removal. The
minimum size for replacement trees shall be four (4) inches in caliper.
Significant Vegetation: Two inches of replacement for every one inch of removal.
Woody Plant Material: The minimum size for replacement woody plant material shall be one
and one-half (1 ½) inches in caliper.
Significant Vegetation: Two plants for every one plant removed. The minimum size
Herbaceous Plant for replacement herbaceous plant material shall be
material equivalent to the plant removed.
All replacement plantings shall be guaranteed for a period of three (3) years. A
replacement plan shall be submitted to the Village Manager or his or her designee for
review and approval prior to the granting of the requested relief.
Any violation of this Section shall be subject to the penalty set forth in this Subdivision
Regulation.
The minimum requirements for tree preservation shall be a tree inventory and location
survey for all trees on the property that are twelve inches (12") D.B.H. and larger and a
type map of trees and significant vegetation less than twelve inches (12") D.B.H. The
project design must show that the project addresses the objectives set forth in the definition
Appendices, Page - 43
of Tree Preservation in Section IV “Definitions” of these Subdivision Regulations and
preserves Significant Trees as defined in the said Section IV.”
In lieu of installing replacement tree(s), the owner or his designee may compensate the
Village with a cash payment at the required replacement value. The replacement value
shall be calculated using the following method:
a. The Village shall obtain three (3) prices from area landscapers,
for the purchase and planting of the required replacement trees,
b. The Village shall take the average of those three (3) prices to calculate
the replacement value,
c. The Village shall invoice the property owner or his designee for the
calculated replacement value,
d. The funds collected shall be placed in the current Village Tree Planting
budget and used solely for the purpose of purchasing and planting new
trees within the Village, included in our arterial & tree replacement
planting.
