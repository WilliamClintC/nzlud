PREFACE 
    The Town of Youngtown Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Lloyce Robinson, town clerk/treasurer, and David Ledyard, town attorney attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supp. No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 17-11 , passed December 21, 2017.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the town as accessible as possible to town officials, town employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, Town Manager, can be added between 2.04, Town Council, and Chapter 2.08, Town Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supp. No 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supp. No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supp. No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense punishable as hereinabove described. 
B.  After having been found responsible for committing three or more civil infractions of the same code provision in any twenty-four-month period, whether by admission, by payment of the fine, by default or by judgment after hearing, a person is a habitual offender and may be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor.

If the denial, nonrenewal, suspension or revocation of a license or permit results from a conviction, the applicant, licensee, or permittee shall be given an opportunity upon appeal to explain the circumstances of the conviction or demonstrate why such conviction does not render the applicant, licensee, or permittee unfit for a license or permit.

C.  Recording a Violation. The notice to abate shall run with the land. The town, at its sole option, may record a notice to abate with the county recorder and thereby cause compliance by an entity thereafter acquiring such property. The non-filing of any notice to abate shall in no way affect the validity of such notice as to entities so notified.

2.  An appeal must be filed within fifteen (15) calendar days of the service of the notice to abate or assessment and must be filed with the town clerk's office.

The verified statement and account shall be an assessment upon the property from which the town corrected or abated the violations and shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as other town assessments are collected. Such assessment shall be recorded in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder and from the date of its recording shall be a lien on the property. Such lien shall be subject to and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under the provisions of this chapter shall be made upon judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. The town may institute an action to enforce the lien in the superior court of the county at any time after the recording of the assessment, but failure to enforce the lien by such action shall not affect its validity. The recorded assessment shall be prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited therein and of the regularity of all proceedings prior to the recording thereof. 
b.  A prior assessment pursuant to this chapter shall not be a bar to a subsequent assessment, and any numbers of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same action.

4.  Where a facility is used by more than one permittee, each permittee is fully responsible for ensuring that all requirements are satisfied. 
5.  Facilities shall be installed, constructed, and maintained so that no additional costs are imposed upon the town and so that the facility does not interfere with other uses or users of the public rights-of-way or town utility easement. This subsection shall not serve to limit the requirement of any other provision of this code or any license, permit, or franchise issued by the town. 
6.  A permit to work in the public right-of-way which requires excavation of a paved right-of-way shall comply with this subsection, in addition to other requirements of this section. A permittee shall be required to be a participant in the regional one-call utility locating system (blue stake). Permittee shall use paint that dissolves within three weeks. In the event permittee's utility markings paint remains visible after three weeks, permittee shall remove such markings without causing damage to the pavement.

2.  As used in this subsection: 
a.  A paved right-of-way is considered "new" when it is first constructed, when it is reconstructed or when it is renovated. 
b.  A right-of-way is considered "reconstructed" when all lanes are completely rebuilt by removing all the pavement and aggregate base course material, re-compacting the sub-base and restoring the base material and then completely re-paving for a distance approved by the town engineer. 
c.  A right-of-way is considered "renovated" when there is a major rehabilitation, including a mill and overlay or other similar improvement work that physically modifies the surface of the right-of-way prior to applying a new surface or other similar work as determined by the town engineer. 
d.  The date of construction, reconstruction or renovation shall be the date such work was accepted by the town. 
3.  An application to work in the public right-of-way which includes excavation in a new paved right-of-way shall not be granted until at least two years after completion and acceptance of the construction, reconstruction or renovation of the paved right-of-way unless one of the following applies: 
a.  Emergency which endangers life or property. 
b.  Interruption of essential utility or communications service. 
c.  Work that is mandated by town, county, state or federal legislation. 
d.  Service for buildings where no other feasible means of providing service exists. 
4.  Pavement Restoration. 
a.  If an excavation is permitted pursuant to paragraphs 3.a-d. above, the permittee shall restore the paved right-of-way by mill and overlay/inlay, for a minimum of curbline to centerline impacted by the excavation(s). For arterial streets, this shall require extending the restoration a minimum length of two feet both directions from the area of the excavation(s) (beyond the end of the trench), and for collector streets this shall mean extending the restoration a minimum length of one foot both directions from the area of the excavation(s) (beyond the end of the trench), all as more specifically directed by the town engineer or public works manager. All renovations shall comply with the town's standard details and specifications. The permittee may elect to fully reconstruct the paved right-of-way in accordance with specifications provided by the town engineer in lieu of paying the pavement restoration fee. 
b.  For excavation commencing two years or later after the paved right-of-way is new (as defined in subsection L.2.), the permittee may elect to renovate such paved right-of-way by mill and overlay/inlay, for a minimum of the curbline to centerline of area(s) impacted by the excavation(s) and for arterial streets extending a minimum length of two feet both directions from the area of the excavation(s) (beyond the end of the trench) and for collector streets extending a minimum length of one foot both directions from the area of the excavation(s) (beyond the end of the trench), all as more specifically directed by the town engineer in lieu of payment of the pavement restoration fee. 
c.  When any utility installed in the roadway consists of three or more perpendicular trenches within one hundred fifty (150) feet, the roadway must be overlaid from the curb line to the centerline. If a trench extends beyond the centerline, a full street overlay will be required. 
d.  When any utility is installed in the roadway and is at an oblique angle to the right-of-way centerline, the roadway must be overlaid from the centerline to the curb line for the entire length of the utility extension. If the utility trenching encroaches on both sides of the centerline, a full street overlay will be required. Pavement overlays shall be perpendicular to the centerline beginning or ending a minimum of one half the street pavement width from the edge of the trench. 
e.  Pavement replacement thickness and type are to be per M.A.G. Section 336. Curb and gutter replacement shall be a minimum of one (1) full section, per M.A.G. standard. Detail 220. Sidewalk replacement shall be a minimum of one full panel. Tunneling under existing sidewalk will not be allowed in the town of Youngtown R.O.W. 
f.  In all cases where a street overlay is required, both ends of the overlay area must be cold-planed perpendicular to the roadway a minimum length of fifteen (15) feet to provide a flush transition. For half-street or full-street overlays, clod planing (grinding) of the entire paving area is required (centerline to gutter or gutter to gutter). When curb and gutter does not exist, the new overlay surface may, at the engineer's discretion, be tapered to meet the elevation of adjacent paved surfaces. All asphalt joints and tapered transitions shall be sealed per M.A.G. uniform standard specifications. 
5.  Pavement Restoration Fee. 
a.  In addition to the other requirements of this section, a permittee shall pay a pavement restoration fee established by resolution of the council. The pavement restoration fee shall be reviewed annually with the budget for street repair. 
b.  The pavement restoration fee shall be paid prior to or at the time a permit to work in the public right-of-way is issued. In the event the pavement restoration fee is amended after a permit to work in the public right-of-way is issued, an adjusted fee shall be paid as follows: 
i.  If the original permit was for one square yard through twenty (20) square yards, the pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the new fee schedule if the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is one square yard or larger. 
ii.  If the original permit was for twenty-one (21) square yards through one hundred (100) square yards, the pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the new fee schedule if the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is more than five percent of the original. 
iii.  If the original permit was for more than one hundred (100) square yards, the pavement restoration fee shall be adjusted pursuant to the new fee schedule if the increase/decrease to the pavement excavation is more than five square yards. 
iv.  Such amended pavement restoration fee shall be applied for and any additional fees shall be paid within one week of the field change or prior to any new permit is issued to permittee. 
M.  Relocation of Facilities. 
1.  General. The town shall bear no cost to relocate its existing facilities, irrespective of the function served, where the town facilities or other facilities occupying the public rights-of-way under authority of a town permit, license, or franchise must be relocated and the conflict between permittee's potential facilities and existing facilities can only be resolved expeditiously as determined by the town by moving the existing town or other approved facilities. 
2.  Delay. If permittee fails to keep or provide accurate records to town or if permittee's relocation effort delays construction of a public project so as to cause the town to be liable for delay damages, permittee shall reimburse the town for those damages attributable to the delay created by permittee. 
3.  Town Costs. Except as otherwise provided in a license, franchise, or permit, or by other provision of law, the entire cost of relocation shall be borne by the town if permittee is required by the town to relocate facilities which are located in private easements obtained by permittee prior to dedicating the public rights-of-way from which facilities must be relocated. These prior rights of permittee would also be unaffected by any subsequent relocation. "Prior rights" as used in this subsection means private easements or other legally sufficient rights obtained by permittee prior to dedication of the public rights-of-way from which the facilities are requested by the town to be relocated. 
N.  Rights Reserved to Town. Without limiting the rights that the town may otherwise have, the town hereby expressly reserves the following rights, powers and authorities:

Chapter 17.48 - PLANNED AREA OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

17.48.010 - Designation of district. 
    The regulations set forth in this chapter, or elsewhere in this title, are the planned area overlay district regulations and are referred to as a "PAD." 
(Ord. 02-12 (part); Zoning Ord. § 5-7-101) 
17.48.020 - Purpose. 
A.  This district is intended to accommodate, encourage and promote innovatively designed developments involving residential and non-residential uses, which together form an attractive and harmonious unit of the community. The district may be designed as a large-scale separate entity, able to function as an individual community or neighborhood; as a small scale project which requires flexibility because of unique circumstances or design characteristics; or as a transitional area between dissimilar land uses (interface zone). 
B.  This district recognizes that adherence to a rigid set of space, bulk and use specifications contained elsewhere in this code would preclude the application of the PAD concept. Therefore, where PAD zoning is deemed appropriate or necessary. The underlying district regulations of a zoning district are modified by the PAD. 
(Ord. 02-12 (part); Zoning Ord. § 5-7-102) 
17.48.030 - Objectives. 
    The objectives of the PAD district are: 
A.  To accommodate variations in building design, lot arrangements and land uses; 
B.  To provide for a coordinated and compatibly arranged variety of land uses through innovative site planning; 
C.  To provide a maximum choice in the types of environments for residential, commercial, industrial uses and facilities; 
D.  To encourage an efficient and safe traffic circulation, including the separation of pedestrian from vehicular traffic; 
E.  To encourage economy in the construction and maintenance of streets and utilities; 
F.  To encourage the provision of useable open space; 
G.  To maintain a reasonable quality of living standard and minimize adverse environmental impact on surrounding areas during development. 
(Zoning Ord. § 5-7-103) 
17.48.040 - Permitted uses. 
    All uses permitted within the PAD district are set forth in the approved plan of development for the site. 
A.  Residential uses may be any variety of types and styles. In the development of a balanced community, a variety of housing types within one project shall be deemed most in keeping with the objectives of this title. 
B.  All other uses shall be determined by the compatibility of such uses with each other and with surrounding land uses. 
(Ord. 02-12 (part); Zoning Ord. § 5-7-104) 
17.48.050 - Intensity of land use. 
    Densities and intensity permitted in the PAD district shall be set forth in the approved plan of development for the site. ( 
(Ord. 02-12 (part); Zoning Ord. § 5-7-105) 
17.48.060 - Construction without approval prohibited. 
    No building or zoning permit shall be issued for any use in this district prior to approval of the final development plan as prescribed in this chapter. 
(Zoning Ord. § 5-7-106) 
17.48.070 - Development plan required. 
    A PAD development plan is required prior to issuance of a building permit. The approval of such plan shall be handled in the following way: 
A.  In case of specific or small scale, single phase projects, the plan, as described in Section 17.48.080, shall be filed at any time prior to the issuance of a building permit. The zoning hearing officer and town council shall hold public hearings in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17.80. 
B.  In case of large, multi-phase areas, such approval may be given in stages. The initial submittal with the application may be a conceptual preliminary plan with sufficient description and documentation to identify nature, mix, general arrangement, density, open space and quality of the project. Such conceptual plan may be then approved conditionally, with the preliminary development plan to be submitted to the zoning hearing officer and town council in time and phases stipulated by town council at the time of rezoning.

(Ord. 08-15 § 1 (part); Ord. 05-02 § 1 (part)) 
17.57.040 - Additional development regulations. 
A.  Setbacks. 
1.  Measurement. Setbacks shall be measured from the boundary of the entire property prior to the WCF application even though the WCF may be sited on one or more smaller individual parcels within a larger lot or parcel. 
2.  Required Setback Distances. All monopoles, alternative WCF light poles and alternative WCF structures shall be set back a distance equal to the greater of: 
a.  Seventy-five (75) feet from any lot or parcel designated for residential use in the general plan; or 
b.  One hundred ten (110) percent of the height of the WCF, including attached antennas; or 
c.  A distance equal to the building setback for the district in which it is located. 
3.  Additional Setbacks Required. Notwithstanding the above setback requirements, monopoles, alternative WCF light poles, alternative WCF structures and public safety communication towers shall be set back from property designated for residential use in the general plan to the maximum extent feasible. 
4.  Equipment Cabinets and Buildings. WCF equipment cabinets and buildings shall comply with the required building setbacks of the base zoning district in which the WCF is located, except as provided for in Section 17.57.030 of this chapter. 
5.  Setback Exemptions. The following WCFs are exempt from WCF setback requirements: 
a.  WCF antennas mounted on an existing vertical element; 
b.  WCF antennas incorporated as a building design element; and 
c.  Equipment cabinets or buildings located on an electric utility substation site. 
B.  Support Structures. 
1.  Alternative WCF Building Element. A building used as a support structure for a WCF shall be a nonresidential building.

3.  Alternative WCF Light Pole. When an alternative WCF light pole replaces one of a group of light poles, its dimensions and appearance shall replicate those of the existing light poles to the maximum extent feasible. 
4.  Existing Vertical Element, Recreational Field Light Pole. When a recreational field light pole replaces one of a group of light poles, its dimensions and appearance shall replicate those of the existing light poles to the maximum extent feasible, and the replacement pole diameter shall not be increased by more than fifty (50) percent from the original. 
5.  Nonconforming Support Structures. A "nonconforming support structure" means a support structure that was lawfully constructed under the provisions of the code or regulations of the district in effect at the time of construction. No alteration to a nonconforming support structure shall be made unless required or permitted by law, unless the alteration will result in reduction or elimination of the nonconformity, or unless the alteration conforms to the following provisions: 
a.  Additions. Additional antennas may be authorized by a special use permit to locate on a nonconforming support structure. In addition to the findings required for approval in Section 17.57.030 of this chapter, required findings for special user permit and Chapter 17.56, Special Uses and Temporary Buildings, of this title, the following findings shall establish the rationale for the granting of relief: 
i.  The existing use of the property is conforming; 
ii.  The additional antenna conforms with the requirements of this chapter; and 
iii.  Any relief granted shall be the minimum required to implement the purposes of this chapter. 
C.  Portable Monopoles. Temporary portable monopoles shall be approved in advance by the town building official, and may be approved for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days for the following purposes: (1) during the construction, modification or replacement of an approved WCF; or (2) during a special event, such as a parade or golf course tournament; or (3) any other temporary communications purpose approved by the town building official. 
D.  Screening and Aesthetics. 
1.  WCFs mounted on existing vertical elements shall use the smallest antenna and array size feasible. An array exceeding four feet in diameter requires a special use permit. 
2.  WCF poles and antennas shall have a nonreflective finish. 
E.  Equipment Cabinets and Buildings. 
1.  Screening. 
a.  Equipment Cabinets and Associated Equipment. Equipment cabinets and associated equipment, including air conditioning units and emergency generators, shall be located within the building or structure upon which antennas are placed, or shall be fully screened from view by a decorative solid fence equal to or exceeding the height of the cabinets. 
b.  Equipment Buildings. Equipment buildings shall be screened from view by an eight-foot decorative solid fence. 
c.  Waiver or Modification of Screening Requirement. If the zoning administrator determines that the WCF cabinets and equipment will only be visible from permanently unoccupied areas, or are already screened from public view, the screening requirement may be waived or modified. 
2.  Height. 
a.  Equipment cabinets shall not exceed eight feet in height. 
b.  Equipment buildings shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height. 
3.  Area. An equipment cabinet or building may contain an area of up to three hundred (300) square feet for a single provider or six hundred (600) square feet for multiple providers. 
F.  Fencing. 
1.  Design. Fencing shall be architecturally compatible with buildings or fencing on the property or adjacent properties.

WCF and any related equipment, including backup generators and air conditioning units, shall not generate continuous noise in excess of forty (40) decibels (dba) measured at the property line of any adjacent residential property, and shall not generate continuous noise in excess of fifty (50) dba during the hours of seven a.m. to ten p.m. and forty (40) dba during the hours of ten p.m. to seven a.m. measured at the property line of any adjacent nonresidential property. Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages and for testing and maintenance purposes. 
I.  Co-Location. The operator of any WCF shall permit co-location of at least one additional WCF on the same support structure or site. Applicants and operators shall share technical information to enable evaluation of the feasibility of co-location. Permit requirements may include permission for an additional operator to install, at their cost, an additional support structure to accommodate co-location. Failure to comply with co-location requirements when feasible as provided for in this section is grounds for denial of a use permit application. 
(Ord. 08-15 § 1 (part); Ord. 05-02 § 1 (part))

B.  The applicant has demonstrated the inability to co-locate the proposed WCF on an existing vertical element; and 
C.  The visibility of the WCF is reduced to the extent feasible by decreasing its height, increasing its setback, locating it in proximity to other structures, using antenna designs which minimize horizontal projections, and constructing it with colors and materials that de-emphasize its visibility. 
(Ord. 05-02 § 1 (part)) 
17.57.060 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.  WCFs on Utility Property. The costs of improvements to utility facilities, poles and property to accommodate a WCF shall not be charged against any municipal aesthetics program funding granted to the town. 
B.  Independent Technical Study. Should the zoning hearing officer require additional technical information that cannot be obtained from the applicant, the town may require the applicant to pay the cost of an independent technical study. 
C.  Revocation. Failure to comply with co-location requirements as provided for in this chapter is grounds for revocation of an existing special use permit following notice and a public hearing.

(Ord. No. 10-11, § I, 6-24-10; Ord. No. 14-02, § I, 3-6-14; Ord. No. 14-06, § I, 9-18-14) 
17.64.040 - Measurement standards. 
A.  Determining Sign Area and Dimensions. 
1.  For a wall sign which is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared and intended to provide a background for a sign display, the area and dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame. 
2.  For a wall sign comprised of individual letters, figures or elements on a wall or similar surface of the building or structure, the area and dimensions of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display areas, including the space between different elements. Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as determined by the zoning, building safety and code enforcement staff, and shall not be included in the total area of a sign. 
B.  Calculation of Wall Sign Area. 
1.  The basic allowance for wall signs shall be limited to one square feet of sign area for each lineal foot of building or tenant frontage. 
2.  All businesses are entitled up to a minimum of twenty-four (24) square feet of sign area provided all other provisions of this title are in compliance. 
3.  Each tenant may have multiple wall signs as long as the total wall sign area does not exceed the allowances established for wall signs. The wall sign or signs shall not be greater than eighty (80) percent of the width of the tenant space or the length of the building frontage for single tenant buildings. 
4.  The minimum area of any wall sign may be increased by twenty-five (25) percent when the building is setback at least two hundred (200) feet from the public right-of-way and may be further increased an additional twenty-five (25) percent for each additional two hundred (200) feet of setback, up to a maximum increase of one hundred (100) percent. 
5.  Additional wall sign area is permitted for a secondary frontage (see definitions) which shall be equal to one hundred (100) percent of the primary sign area allowance based on allowances selected. 
6.  Signs shall not project above the wall or parapet. 
7.  Additional wall signs for multiple-story buildings are permitted on each of the building's primary and secondary frontages according to the following: 
a.  For a building with two floors the additional permitted sign area is twenty (20) square feet for each eligible wall. 
b.  This additional permitted sign area may be increased by ten (10) square feet for each additional building floor. 
c.  The sign must be placed at the height for which the bonus has been granted. 

8.  For a freestanding sign, the sign area shall include the frame, if any, but shall not include: 
a.  A pole or other structural support unless such pole or structural support is internally illuminated or otherwise so designed to constitute a display device, or a part of a display device. 
b.  Architectural features that are either part of the building or part of a freestanding structure, and not an integral part of the sign, and which may consist of landscaping, building or structural forms complementing the site in general. 

9.  When two identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time or a maximum forty-five (45) degree angle for double-faced sign, and are part of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed as the measurement of one of the two faces. When the sign has more than two display surfaces, the area of the sign shall be the area of largest display surfaces that are visible from any single direction. 
10.  In the event of a dispute in determining the area or dimension of any sign, a negative decision of the administration may be appealed, by the applicant submitting a formal application to the board of adjustment with the appropriate nonrefundable fees. 


Comment: The minimum height should assure that the bottom of the sign is visible above parked and moving vehicles and any other obstructions that would block the view of the sign. To accomplish this, the minimum height of the sign (to accommodate a minimum clearance of seven feet from the ground and the message area) should be twelve (12) feet to the top of the sign. This limited height, however, only permits a sign area five feet in height. A fourteen-foot sign would afford greater design flexibility for the shape of the sign. Lower signs should only be considered on local retail or industrial streets when there is a generous landscaped area adjacent to the street in which to place the sign, the traffic volumes are light and the speed is relatively slow. 
C.  Determining Sign Height (See [section] 17.64.050 for commercial zoning district dimensions) 
    The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured from the base of the sign or supportive structure at its point of attachment to the ground, to the highest point of the sign. A freestanding sign on a manmade base, including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the grade of the nearest pavement or top of any pavement curb. 
1.  There shall be both a minimum and a maximum height of freestanding signs for each property with the standards established for each character area. 


Comment: The measurement of the sign height is to assure that each sign has reasonable and generally equal visibility. This means that if the grade of the site is substantially lower than the adjacent public street, the building inspector or code enforcement official should have the authority to determine that additional sign height is warranted (above the lower grade) to assure that the sign has visibility equal to the other signs along the street. Alternatively, the sign should not be granted extra height by measuring the height from an "artificial" site feature that has raised the base of the sign substantially above the grade of the adjacent street. 
2.  No portion of a freestanding sign shall be in or project over a public right-of-way and the maximum setback shall be no greater than twenty (20) feet from the property line. 
D.  Determining Building Frontages and Frontage Lengths. 
1.  Building Unit - The building unit is equivalent to the tenant space. The frontage of the tenant space on the first floor shall be the basis for determining the permissible sign area for wall signs. 
2.  Primary and Secondary Frontage - The frontage of any building unit shall include the elevation(s) facing a public street, facing a primary parking area for the building or tenants, or containing the public entrance(s) to the building or building units. 
a.  The primary frontage shall be considered the portion of any frontage with the primary public entrance(s) to the building or building units. 
b.  The secondary frontage shall include those frontages containing secondary public entrances to the building or building units, and all building walls facing a public street or primary parking area that are not designated as the primary building frontage by subsection above. 
E.  Length of Building Frontage. 
1.  The length of any primary or secondary building frontage, as defined above, shall be the sum of all wall lengths parallel, or nearly parallel, to such frontage, excluding any such wall length determined by the administration clearly unrelated to the frontage criteria. 
2.  For buildings with two or more frontages, the length of the wall and allowable sign area shall be calculated separately for each such building frontage. The building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of the party walls defining the building unit.

A.  Each application for a license to construct, operate or maintain a cable system in the town shall be filed with the town clerk and shall include the following:

(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.06.020 - License fees. 
A.  Each application for new license, renewal, transfer or assignment, or modification of license to be granted under the authority of this title shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount specified below, by a certified or cashier's check made payable to the town. Fees in the following amounts are required: 
1.  For a new license ..... $5,000.00 
2.  For a renewal license ..... 5,000.00 
3.  For consent to transfer or change of control, this license ..... 5,000.00 
4.  For license modifications ..... No charge 
B.  If the applicant's application is not approved, such fee is nonrefundable. If the application is approved, the application fee will be refunded by offset of license fees to be paid to town. 
C.  In consideration of the license granted, licensee shall pay the town five percent of the licensee's gross revenues as defined in this title. Licensee must pay the license fee due to the town for the preceding quarter within thirty (30) days of the end of that quarter. Monthly payments will be acceptable. 
D.  If licensee provides its subscriber a price discount if the subscriber purchases a bundle of cable service and noncable services, and the licensee's marketing materials do not allocate the price of cable service included in the bundle, then the discount shall be allocated based on licensee's standard, nondiscounted rate for the services in the bundle. The following examples illustrate how the discount would be allocated: 
1.  Assume a subscriber's charges for a given month for cable service alone would be forty dollars ($40.00), for local telephone service alone thirty dollars ($30.00), and for high-speed data service alone thirty dollars ($30.00), for a total of one hundred dollars ($100.00). If licensee offers the three services at a combined rate of eighty dollars ($80.00) (i.e. the subscriber obtains a twenty-percent discount from the regular retail rates that would apply to the services if purchased separately), then the gross revenue from cable service would be deemed to be thirty-two dollars ($32.00) forty dollars ($40.00), less twenty (20) percent of forty dollars ($40.00). 
2.  Assume the same facts as the preceding example, except that the subscriber also purchases an upgrade to cable service (such as Home Box Office) at a fixed fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) a month that is not included in the bundled service offering the discount (i.e. the discount does not apply to this service), for a total of ninety-five dollars ($95.00) (eighty dollars ($80.00) for the bundle, plus fifteen dollars ($15.00)). Gross revenue would be forty-seven dollars ($47.00) (thirty-two dollars ($32.00) as calculated in the prior example, plus the undiscounted fifteen dollars ($15.00)). 
3.  Nothing herein shall be construed to require licensee to offer any service at a price in conflict with a price for that service mandated by law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.06.030 - Issuance of license.

20.31.010 - Formal renewal. 
    If an existing licensee initiates a formal license renewal process under 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) through (g) of the Cable Act, the licensee must notify the town, at least thirty-six (36) months and no later than thirty (30) months before the license expiration date. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.31.020 - Formal renewal process. 
    When the town receives a notice from the licensee, the town shall take the following actions: 
A.  The town will not begin review of any renewal request unless all applications and fees have been paid. The future renewal of this license is not effective until the licensee has followed the renewal process including submittal of a completed application and the payment of the renewal fee. The town shall notify the licensee of the current amount of the renewal fee and current procedures for renewal. 
B.  The town shall review and evaluate the future cable-related community needs and interests and the licensee's past performance. The review and evaluation shall include opportunity for public comment. 
C.  On completion of the review and evaluation, the town shall notify the licensee that it may file a renewal application. The notice shall specify the information to be included in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application. The filing deadline shall not be earlier than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. If the licensee does not submit a renewal application by the specified date, the license may not be renewed under this section. 
D.  The town shall hold one or more public hearings on the renewal application when the application is received or provide some other procedure for public comment on the application. 
E.  After the public hearing or comment period, the town manager shall recommend to the council that it either: 
1.  Renew the license, as written, subject to the existing terms of the license agreement satisfactory to the town and the licensee; 
2.  Renew the license, subject to new or amended terms of the license agreement satisfactory to the town and the licensee; or 
3.  Issue a preliminary decision that the license should not be renewed. 
F.  Council action must be taken within four months of the date of the renewal application notice to the licensee. 
G.  In considering a renewal application, the town must consider whether: 
1.  The cable operator has substantially complied with the material terms of the existing license and with applicable law; 
2.  The quality of the cable operator's service, including signal quality, response to consumer complaints, and billing practices has been reasonable in light of community needs (but without regard to the mix or quality, of cable services or other services provided over the cable system); 
3.  The cable operator has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment in its proposal; and 
4.  The cable operator's proposal is reasonable to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests, taking into account the cost of meeting the needs and interests. 
H.  If a preliminary decision is made that the license should not be renewed, at the request of the licensee or on its own initiative, the town must commence an administrative proceeding under 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) of the Cable Act. Parties to the hearing and the public must have thirty (30) days after the recommended decision is issued to comment. The town manager must recommend that the council grant or deny an application within thirty (30) calendar days after the deadline for receipt of comments if the request requires that formal procedures are followed. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.31.030 - Informal renewal process. 
    If licensee does not utilize the formal renewal process under the Cable Act, licensee shall file an application for a license with the town pursuant to section 20.06.010 application for new license at any time pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 546(h), but at least six months prior to expiration of the existing license. The town must hold one or more public hearings or provide some other procedure for public comment on the proposal. After the public hearing or comment period, the town manager must recommend that the council grant or deny the license renewal and the terms and conditions of any recommended renewal. A denial under this section shall not affect licensee's formal renewal rights under the Cable Act. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.31.040 - Final decision. 
A.  Regardless of formal or informal procedures, the council must hold a public hearing on all renewal applications. After the public hearing, the council must consider all of the evidence, either grant or deny the renewal application by written resolution, and give the findings of fact and reasons for its determination in the resolution. 
B.  The council must hold a public hearing on the license agreement prior to final council action on the license. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.31.050 - Events after denial of renewal. 
A.  Subject to chapter 20.27, effect of termination or expiration on telecommunications services, if the town denies the renewal of license, the town may, on the recommendation of the town manager and with the approval of the council and the licensee, acquire ownership of the cable system or transfer operation of the system to another company. Any acquisition or transfer under this subsection must be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued as a going concern. 
B.  Subject to chapter 20.27, effect of termination or expiration on telecommunications services, if the town does not renew license, and to the extent consistent with applicable law, the town has the option of (a) purchasing the cable system if agreeable to licensee, (b) require the licensee or surety to remove the facilities and equipment at the licensee or surety's expense, or (c) begin condemnation proceedings and permit the facilities to remain until ownership has been determined or bond surety collected. 
C.  If any or all of the components of the cable system in, on or above the town's rights-of-way are not removed within one year, the cable system will be considered abandoned and becomes the property of the town. 
D.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this license, town shall not require the removal, sale or other disposition of the cable system until any judicial or administrative appeal of the town's decision to revoke or not renew the license is final and nonappealable. Furthermore, if within thirty (30) days from said final decision licensee commences and continues to make good faith efforts to sell its cable system, licensee shall have a period of one year from said final decision to transfer or sell its cable system. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10) 
20.31.060 - Appeal. 
    The town council's decision to not renew may be appealed to the superior court. Subject to the town police powers that may require immediate cessation of licensee operations to protect the public health, safety, welfare and property, licensee may continue to operate until there is a final, nonappealable decision to not renew. 
(Ord. No. 10-01, § I, 1-7-10)
