COTTONWOOD MUNICIPAL CODE 1987 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Cottonwood, Arizona 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 9, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Cottonwood, Arizona, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1987, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Patty McDaniel, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 9, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through 
Ordinance No. 660, passed March 5, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 9, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 9, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

6.13.020 - Control of a vicious dog 
    Once a dog is declared vicious, the city magistrate or hearing officer may require in his/her sole discretion any combination of the following steps by the owner or custodian to continue ownership or custodial care of such animal. The steps are broken down into immediate and time limited: 
A.  Immediate (compliance within one calendar day upon completion of notification of a determination of viciousness): 
1.  Leash and Muzzle. No person shall permit a vicious dog outside confinement, unless such dog is securely leashed with a leash not longer than six feet in length. No person shall permit a vicious dog to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash outside confinement, unless a person is in physical control of the leash. Such dogs may not be leashed to inanimate objects, such as trees, posts, buildings, etc. In addition, all vicious dogs on a leash outside confinement must be muzzled by a muzzling device sufficient to prevent such dog from biting persons or other animals. Any pen must meet the requirements of subsection B.1 of this section. 
2.  Notification. Should it be necessary to provide the dog with medical attention, it is the responsibility of the owner or custodian to provide advance notification to the veterinarian's office that this dog has been declared vicious. 
3.  Confinement Indoors. No vicious dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog to exit such building of its own volition. In addition, no such animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the dog from exiting the structure. If the door is answered while the dog is indoors, the dog must either be on a leash or behind another closed door. 
4.  Reporting Requirements. The following types of information must be reported by the owner or custodian of the dog to the hearing officer within ten calendar days of occurrence: 
a.  Spaying or neutering of dog; 
b.  Any permanent change of location and/or ownership of the dog to another location and/or owner or custodian. 
5.  The following occurrences must be reported by the owner or custodian to hearing officer, enforcement agent, or law enforcement officer within twenty-four hours of occurrence: 
a.  A vicious dog is at large; 
b.  A vicious dog bites or attacks another dog, cat or livestock, with or without provocation; 
c.  A human being has been attacked by the vicious dog, with or without provocation. 
B.  "Time Limited" means that a time schedule for completion of actions is set by the city magistrate or hearing officer, but in no case will it be longer than thirty calendar days: 
1.  Confinement. All vicious dogs shall be securely confined indoors or in a securely enclosed and locked pen, except when leashed and muzzled. Such pen or structure must have secure sides and a secure top attached to the sides. 
a.  All structures used to confine vicious dogs must be locked with a key or combination lock when such animals are within the structure. This structure must have a secure top and bottom or floor attached to the sides of the pen. If there is no secure floor, the sides of the pen must be embedded in the ground not less than two feet; 
b.  No pen wall may be part of a perimeter fence; 
c.  All structures erected to house vicious dogs must comply with all applicable regulations of the city. All such structures must be adequately lighted, ventilated, and kept in a clean and sanitary condition and any other condition that provides for humane care. 
2.  Registration. A dog declared vicious shall not only be routinely registered with the police department yearly, but shall also be permanently registered as a vicious dog. At the expense of the owner or custodian, a registration number as decided by the city magistrate or hearing officer, will be tattooed on the inner right ear. This tattoo will be placed by a veterinarian. A written certificate shall be obtained from the veterinarian and provided to the city magistrate or hearing officer to prove compliance. 
3.  Reproduction. Any dog that is declared vicious shall be spayed or neutered by a veterinarian after notice of declaration. A certificate from the veterinarian shall be obtained by the owner or custodian and provided to the hearing officer to prove compliance. 
4.  Change of Ownership. Once a dog has been declared vicious, ownership may not be transferred to any other person without notice to the city magistrate or hearing officer. The new owner is required to be in compliance with this chapter. 
5.  Signs. All owners or custodians of vicious dogs within the city shall display, in a prominent place on their premises, a sign in three-inch letters which is easily readable by the public using the words "vicious dog." In addition, a similar sign is required to be posted on the pen of such animal. 
(Ord. No. 592, § 1, 2-19-2013) 
6.13.030 - Appeal process. 
A.  The owner or custodian may pursue an appeal of the hearing officer's decision within five calendar days of the mailing of the determination. He/she may appeal by bringing a petition to the municipal court requesting that the court conduct a de novo hearing on whether the dog should be declared vicious. The hearing officer will be served notice by the municipal court of the hearing and it shall be held within seven calendar days of the notification of the hearing officer. In addition, all interested persons (as defined in Section 6.13.010.D of this chapter) may receive notification of the hearing. The city magistrate will make a decision based on the preponderance of evidence. If the dog is declared vicious, the court shall inform the owner or custodian or, if the matter is taken under advisement, the court may mail notice of the determination of viciousness to him/her. Notification of the determination will be complete at the mailing of the notice. During the process of appeal, the owner or custodian shall be responsible for complying with the immediate steps of the control process. He/she shall be allowed not more than thirty calendar days to institute the time-limited steps after notification of a determination of viciousness. 
B.  The determination by the municipal court will be final and conclusive with regard to the issues raised and adjudicated. Such determination will not bar an animal control officer, law enforcement officer or citizen from requesting a hearing to determine viciousness of the dog for subsequent actions of the dog. 
(Ord. No. 592, § 1, 2-19-2013) 
6.13.040 - Penalties.

C.  The court may, upon ex parte motion of the prosecutor, peace officer or other appropriate city official, order the impoundment of a dog continued or a dog seized and impounded upon a written showing of probable cause to believe that the owner or custodian of a vicious dog has violated or permitted a violation of any provision of this chapter.

This statement may be given in person to the judge, or by telephone, radio, or other means of electronic communication. This statement shall be deemed to be an affidavit for the purposes of issuance of an order pursuant to this subsection. In such cases, if a recording of the sworn statement has been made, the judge may direct that the statement be transcribed and certified by the judge and filed with the court. 
D.  If a dog is ordered seized and/or impounded, the court shall set a hearing not more than ten days from the date of seizure with notice to the owner or custodian. In addition to sending such notice by certified mail, such notice shall also be accomplished by one of the following methods or attempted by at least two of the following methods:

The dog held in impoundment for a maximum of thirty days or until the owner or custodian complies with the immediate or time-limited steps specified by a hearing officer or judge, whichever occurs first. If, at the end of thirty days, the owner or custodian has failed to comply with the immediate or time-limited steps specified by a hearing officer or judge, the dog shall be destroyed; or 
2.  The dog destroyed in accordance with A.R.S. § 11-1014.H and A.R.S § 11-1029. In addition, the court may order the owner or custodian to pay all expenses, including shelter, food, handling and veterinary care, necessitated by the enforcement of this chapter. 
F.  Any vicious dog that kills a human being, dog, cat or livestock may be destroyed. 
G.  In the event that the owner or custodian of the vicious dog is a minor, the parent or guardian in physical control of such minor at the time of the acts giving rise to the determination of viciousness shall be liable:

B.  To implement the goals, objectives and policies of the city of Cottonwood general plan relating to assuring that new development contributes its fair share towards the costs of public facilities reasonable necessitated by such new development. 
C.  To ensure that new development is reasonable benefited by the provision of the public facilities provided with the proceeds of impact fees. 
D.  To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are properly incorporated in these procedures.

Chapter 18.08 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 615, § 1, adopted September 15, 2015, repealed the former ch. 18.08, § 18.08.010, and enacted a new ch. 18.08 as set out herein. The former ch. 18.08 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 404 § 1, adopted in 2001; and Ord. No. 218 § 1, adopted in 1987. 

18.08.01 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and methods. 
A.  Statutory Authorization. A.R.S. § 48-3610 authorizes the city to assume the powers and duties for floodplain management and adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3609 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Cottonwood, Arizona, does hereby ordain as follows: 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection, and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities. When obstructions are inadequately anchored, this may cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to flood loss. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare. It is also the purpose of this chapter to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities; utilities such as water, gas, electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize blight zones caused by flooding; 
7.  Notify potential buyers that a property is in a special flood hazard area; 
8.  Notify those who occupy special flood hazard areas that they assume responsibility for their actions; 
9.  Participate in and maintain eligibility for flood insurance and disaster relief. 
D.  Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development activities which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 615, § 1, 9-15-2015) 
18.08.02 - Definitions. 
    Accessory structure. A structure that is on the same parcel of property as a principal structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
    Alluvial fan. A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and deposited on the valley floors. This feature is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement, sediment deposition, and channel migration. 
    Apex. A point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    Appeal. A request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding. A designated zone AO, AH, AR/AO or AR/AH on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with a one percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood-related erosion hazard. The land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. 
    Base flood. A flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Base flood elevation (BFE). The computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during the base flood. 
    Basement. Any area of the building having its floor sub-grade, i.e., below ground level, on all sides.

    Community. Any state, area or political subdivision thereof, any Indian tribe, authorized tribal organization, or authorized native organization, which has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations for the areas within its jurisdiction. 
    Determining market value of existing structures. "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. 
1.  The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. 
2.  The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. 
3.  Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    Development. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevation certificate. An administrative tool of the national flood insurance program (NFIP) that is used to provide elevation information necessary to ensure compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, to determine the proper insurance premium rate, and to support a request for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) or letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F). 
    Encroachment. The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Erosion. The process of the gradual wearing away of landmasses. This peril is not, per se, covered under the national flood insurance program. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before May 5, 1975. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of floodwaters; 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or 
3.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in this definition. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The official map of a community, on which the federal emergency management agency has delineated both the special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS). The official report provided by the federal emergency management agency that includes flood profiles, flood insurance rate maps, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodplain or flood-prone area. Any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "flood or flooding." 
    Floodplain administrator. The community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodplain board. The city council of the city of Cottonwood at such times as they are engaged in the enforcement of this chapter. 
    Floodplain management. The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations. This chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to nonresidential structures which reduce or eliminate risk of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents by means other than elevation. 
    Flood-related erosion. The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
    Flood-related erosion area management. The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
    Floodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
    Floodway fringe. That area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
    Fraud and victimization. As related to Section 18.08.06 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council, when acting in its capacity as the floodplain board will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one-hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the regulatory flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    Functionally dependent use. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    Governing body. The city council of the city of Cottonwood, Yavapai County, Arizona. 
    Hardship. As related to Section 18.08.06 of this chapter, the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant a requested variance. The city council of the city of Cottonwood in its capacity as the city's floodplain board requires that a variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. A variance cannot be self-caused. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure. Any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the national register of historic places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the national register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.  By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior; or 
b.  Directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
    Levee. A man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system. A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including the basement. See "basement." An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value. Replacement cost of a structure less depreciation since construction. 
    Mean sea level. For purposes of the national flood insurance program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    New construction. For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial flood insurance rate map or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision. A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the community. 
    Obstruction. Including, but not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-hundred-year flood or 100-year flood. A common name for the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. See "base flood." 
    Person. An individual or the individual's agent, a firm, partnership, association or corporation, or an agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

    Public safety and nuisance. As related to Section 18.08.06 of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory flood elevation (RFE). An elevation one foot above the base flood elevation. 
    Regulatory floodway. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Remedy a violation. To bring the structure or other development into compliance with federal, state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine. Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, wash, etc. 
    Sheet flow area. See "area of shallow flooding." 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA). An area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood insurance rate map as zone A, AO, AE, AH or A99. 
    Start of construction. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement to a structure, the total cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction or other uses of property in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with these floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Water surface elevation. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

    Zone A. No base flood elevations determined. 
    Zone AE. Base flood elevations determined. 
    Zone AH. Flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); Base Flood Elevations determined. 
    Zone AO. Flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths determined. For areas of alluvial fan flooding, velocities also determined. 
    Zone AR. Special flood hazard area formerly protected from the one percent annual chance flood by a flood control system that was subsequently decertified. Zone AR indicates that the former flood control system is being restored to provide protection from the one percent annual chance or greater flood. 
    Zone A99. Area to be protected from one percent annual chance flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations determined. 
    Zone D. Areas in which flood hazards are undetermined, but possible.

    Zone X (shaded). Areas of 0.2 percent annual chance flood; areas of one percent annual chance flood with average depths of less than one foot or with drainage areas less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from one percent annual chance flood. 
(Ord. No. 615, § 1, 9-15-2015) 
18.08.03 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the corporate city limits. (ARS § 48-3603.) 
B.  Basis for Establishing Special Flood Hazard Areas. The special flood hazard areas identified by the federal emergency management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Yavapai County, Arizona and Incorporated Areas" dated September 3, 2010, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) dated September 3, 2010, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the floodplain board by the floodplain administrator. The floodplain board, within its area of jurisdiction, shall delineate (or may, by rule, require developers of land to delineate) for areas where development is ongoing or imminent, and thereafter as development becomes imminent, floodplains consistent with the criteria developed by the federal emergency management agency and the director of the state department of water resources. The FIS and FIRM panels are on file at Public Works Building at 1490 West Mingus Avenue, Cottonwood, Arizona, 86326. 
C.  Compliance. All development of land, construction of residential, commercial or industrial structures, or future development within delineated floodplain areas is subject to the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
F.  Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the state, county or the federal emergency management agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
G.  Statutory Exceptions. 
1.  In accordance with A.R.S. § 48-3609(H), unless expressly provided, this and any regulation adopted pursuant to this article do not affect: 
2.  Existing legal uses of property or the right to continuation of such legal use. However, if a nonconforming use of land or a building or structure is discontinued for twelve months, or damaged to the extent of fifty per cent of its market value as determined by a certified appraiser, any further use shall comply with this chapter and other applicable regulations of the city; 
3.  Reasonable repair or alteration of property for the purposes for which the property was legally used on August 3, 1984, or on the date any regulations affecting such property take effect, except that any alteration, addition or repair to a nonconforming building or structure which would result in increasing its flood damage potential by fifty percent or more shall be either floodproofed or elevated to or above the regulatory flood elevation; 
4.  Reasonable repair of structures constructed with the written authorization required by A.R.S. § 48-3613; 
5.  Facilities constructed or installed pursuant to a certificate of environmental compatibility issued pursuant to A.R.S. Title 40, Chapter 2, Article 6.2; and 
6.  In accordance with A.R.S. § 48-3613(D), in addition to other penalties or remedies otherwise provided by law, the state, a political subdivision or a person who may be damaged or has been damaged as a result of the unauthorized diversion, retardation or obstruction of a watercourse has the right to commence, maintain and prosecute any appropriate action or pursue any remedy to enjoin, abate or otherwise prevent any person from violating or continuing to violate these regulations or regulations adopted pursuant to A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 21, Article 1. If a person is found to be in violation of any provision of this chapter, the court shall require the violator to either comply with this chapter if authorized by the floodplain board and/or remove the obstruction and restore the watercourse to its original state. The court may also award such monetary damages as are appropriate to the injured parties resulting from the violation including reasonable costs and attorney fees. 
7.  Before the following types of construction authorized by A.R.S. § 48-3613(B) begin, the responsible person must submit plans for the construction to the floodplain board for review and comment pursuant to A.R.S. § 48-3613(C): 
8.  The construction of bridges, culverts, dikes and other structures necessary to the construction of public highways, roads and streets intersecting or crossing a watercourse; 
9.  The construction of storage dams for watering livestock or wildlife, structures on banks of a watercourse to prevent erosion of or damage to adjoining land if the structure will not divert, retard or obstruct the natural channel of the watercourse or dams for the conservation of floodwaters as permitted by A.R.S. Title 45, Chapter 6; 
10.  Construction of tailing dams and waste disposal areas for use in connection with mining and metallurgical operations. This paragraph does not exempt those sand and gravel operations that will divert, retard or obstruct the flow of waters in any watercourse from complying with and acquiring authorization from the floodplain board pursuant to regulations adopted by the floodplain board under this chapter; 
11.  Other construction upon determination by the floodplain board that written authorization is unnecessary; 
12.  The construction of streams, waterways, lakes and other auxiliary facilities in conjunction with development of public parks and recreation facilities by a public agency or political subdivision; and 
13.  The construction and erection of poles, towers, foundations, support structures, guy wires and other facilities related to power transmission as constructed by any utility whether a public service corporation or a political subdivision. 
H.  Unlawful Acts. 
1.  It is unlawful for a person to engage in any development or to divert, retard or obstruct the flow of waters in a watercourse if it creates a hazard to life or property without securing the written authorization required by A.R.S. § 48-3613. Where the watercourse is a delineated floodplain, it is unlawful to engage in any development affecting the flow of waters without securing written authorization required by A.R.S. § 48-3613. 
2.  Any person found guilty of violating any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor. Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate offense punishable as hereinabove described. 
I.  Declaration of Public Nuisance Statute. All development located or maintained within any special flood hazard area after August 8, 1973, in violation of this chapter, is a public nuisance per se and may be abated, prevented or restrained by the city. 
J.  Abatement of Violations. Within thirty days of discovery of a violation of this chapter or as soon as possible thereafter, the floodplain administrator shall submit a report to the floodplain board which shall include all information available to the floodplain administrator which is pertinent to said violation. Within thirty days of receipt of this report or as soon as possible thereafter, the floodplain board shall either: 
1.  Take any necessary action to effect the abatement of such violation; or 
2.  Issue a variance to this chapter in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.08.06 herein; or 
3.  Order the owner of the property upon which the violation exists to provide whatever additional information may be required for their determination. Such information must be provided to the floodplain administrator within thirty days of such order and the floodplain administrator shall submit an amended report to the floodplain board within twenty days. At the next regularly scheduled public meeting (or at any subsequent meeting at which the matter is to be considered), the floodplain board may either order the abatement of said violation, or may grant a variance in accordance with the provisions of Section 18.08.06 herein; or 
4.  Submit to the federal emergency management agency a declaration for denial of insurance, stating that the property is in violation of a cited state or local law, regulation or ordinance, pursuant to Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 as amended. 
K.  Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 615, § 1, 9-15-2015)

1.  Notify adjacent communities and the state department of water resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the federal emergency management agency through appropriate notification means; and 
2.  Ensure that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse will be maintained. 
b.  Changes in base flood elevation and rate of flow due to physical alterations: 
1.  Base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available to the floodplain administrator, the floodplain administrator shall notify the federal emergency management agency of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with Volume 44 Code of Federal Regulations Section 65.3. 
2.  Within one hundred twenty days after completion of construction of any flood control protective works within the city which changes the rate of flow during the base flood or the configuration of the floodplain upstream or downstream from or adjacent to the project, the person or agency responsible for installation of the project shall provide to the governing bodies of all jurisdictions affected by the project a new delineation of all floodplains affected by the project in accordance with the criteria adopted by the state department of water resources. 
c.  The floodplain administrator shall advise the Yavapai County Flood Control District (YCFCD) and any adjunct jurisdiction having responsibility for floodplain management in writing and provide a copy of development plans for all applications of which the city becomes aware for floodplain use permits or variances to develop land in a floodplain or floodway within one mile of the corporate city limits, and/or which could affect floodplains, floodways or watercourses within the district or adjunct jurisdiction's area of jurisdiction. Written notice and a copy of the plan of development shall be sent to the district or adjunct jurisdiction no later than five working days after having been received by the city. 
d.  The floodplain administrator shall notify the federal emergency management agency and state department of water resources of acquisition by means of annexation, incorporation or otherwise, of additional areas of jurisdiction. 
6.  Map Determinations. The floodplain administrator shall make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas (e.g., where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 18.08.06. 
7.  Remedial Actions. The floodplain administrator shall take actions on violations of this chapter as required in Section 18.08.03.A. herein. 
C.  Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit. A floodplain development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins, including placement of manufactured homes, within any special flood hazard area established pursuant to Section 18.08.03.B. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevation of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures. In zone AO, elevation of existing highest adjacent grade and proposed elevation of lowest floor of all structures; 
2.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure will be floodproofed; 
3.  Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section 18.08.05.A.3.b; 
4.  Base flood elevation data for subdivision proposals or other development greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser; and 
5.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 615, § 1, 9-15-2015) 
18.08.05 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  Standards of Construction. In all special flood hazard areas the following standards shall apply: 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
b.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 18.08.05.E.2. 
2.  Construction Materials and Methods. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
b.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
c.  Within zones AH or AO, adequate drainage paths shall be constructed around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
3.  Elevation and Floodproofing. 
a.  Residential Construction. Residential construction, as well as new or substantial improvements to residential structures, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the regulatory flood elevation. 
1.  In a zone AO, the base flood elevation is determined from the FIRM panel. If unspecified, the required elevation is at minimum two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
2.  In a zone A where the base flood elevation has not been determined, the base flood elevation is determined by the criteria set out in Section 18.08.04.B.3. 
3.  In zones AE and AH, the base flood elevation is determined from the FIS and/or FIRM. 
4.  A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the regulatory flood elevation, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters. See section 18.08.05.A.3.d.1. or 2. 
Upon completion of the structure, certification by a registered professional engineer or surveyor that the elevation requirements of the lowest floor, including basement, of this section have been satisfied shall be provided to the floodplain administrator for verification. 
b.  Nonresidential Construction. Nonresidential construction, as well as new or substantial improvements to residential structures, shall have the lowest floor either elevated to conform with Section 18.08.05.A.3.a.1, 2., or 3. as appropriate, or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, 
1.  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under Section 18.08.05.A.3.a.1., 2., or 3. as appropriate so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; and 
2.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
Upon completion of the structure, certification by a registered professional engineer, surveyor, or architect that either the elevation requirements of subsection A or the floodproofing requirements of subsection B have been satisfied shall be provided to the floodplain administrator for verification. 
c.  Manufactured Home. Manufactured homes shall meet the standards in Section 18.08.05.E. 
d.  Accessory Structures (detached garages and storage structures). Accessory structures used solely for parking of vehicles or storage may be constructed such that the floor is below the regulatory flood elevation, provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements: 
1.  Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking of vehicles or storage; 
2.  The portions of the accessory structure located below the Regulatory Flood Elevation must be built using flood resistant materials;

4.  Any machinery or equipment servicing the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the Regulatory Flood Elevation; 
5.  The accessory structure must comply with floodway encroachment provisions in Section 18.08.05.G; and 
6.  The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters in accordance with Section 18.08.05.A.3.e 1. or 2. 
Detached garages, storage structures and other accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 18.08.05.A.3.a 1., 2., or 3. as appropriate. 
Upon completion of the structure, certification by a registered professional engineer or surveyor that the requirements of this section have been satisfied shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator for verification. 
e.  Flood Openings. All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following criteria for non-engineered openings: 
1.  Have a minimum of two openings, on different sides of each enclosed area, having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they either permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater, or have been designed and certified by a registered engineer or architect. 
f.  Machinery and Service Equipment. All new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
B.  Standards for Storage of Materials and Equipment. 
1.  The storage or processing of materials that could be injurious to human, animal or plant life if released due to damage from flooding is prohibited in special flood hazard areas. 
2.  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to damage by floods and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
C.  Standards for Water Supply and Waste Disposal Systems. 
1.  All new or replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system and discharge from systems into flood waters. 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
3.  Waste disposal systems shall not be installed wholly or partially in a regulatory floodway. 
D.  Additional Development Standards for Subdivisions. 
1.  All new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions), greater than fifty lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
a.  Identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood; 
b.  Identify on the final plans the elevation(s) of the proposed structure(s) and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the final lowest floor and grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator for verification. 
c.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
d.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
e.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
E.  Standards for Manufactured Homes. All manufactured homes that are placed on site or substantially improved shall: 
1.  Be elevated to conform with Section 18.08.05.A.3.a.1., 2., or 3., as appropriate so that the bottom of the structural frame or the lowest point of any attached appliances, whichever is lower, is at or above the regulatory flood elevation; and 
2.  Be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state, county and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
Upon completion of installation of the manufactured home, certification by a registered professional engineer or surveyor that the elevation requirements of this section have been satisfied shall be provided to the floodplain administrator for verification. 
F.  Standards for Recreation Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on site shall: 
1.  Be on site for fewer than one hundred and eighty consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 18.08.04 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 18.08.05.D. 
G.  Floodways. Located within the special flood hazard areas established in Section 18.08.03.B are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development, unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided to the floodplain administrator demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  No activity is permitted within a floodway which might cause lateral migration of waters at high or low stages, or channel bed degradation/aggradation without a floodplain development permit. 
3.  If Section 18.08.05.G is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall also comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 18.08.05. 
(Ord. No. 615, § 1, 9-15-2015) 
18.08.06 - Variance procedure. 
A.  Nature of Variances. The variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter is based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain[ing] to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. A variance cannot be self-caused. 
    It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are extremely rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Floodplain Review Board. 
1.  The city council, acting as the floodplain board may establish a board of review, which may be the advisory board or a committee of the advisory board to sit in review and make decisions. If the city council in its capacity as the floodplain board does not establish a separate floodplain review board, then the city council in its capacity as the floodplain board shall act as the floodplain review board. 
2.  The floodplain review board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
3.  In considering such applications, the floodplain review board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
4.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
5.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
6.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
7.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
8.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
9.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
10.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
11.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
12.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
13.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; 
14.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges. 
15.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 18.08.06.B.3. and the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
16.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the floodplain administrator that: 
17.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the regulatory flood elevation may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage or more; and 
18.  Such construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases risks to life and property; 
19.  The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by A.R.S. § 37-610. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
20.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance. 
C.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  Variances shall only be issued: 
a.  Upon a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; 
b.  For the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures' continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; 
c.  Upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
d.  Upon a showing of good and sufficient cause; 
e.  Upon a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and/or 
f.  Upon a showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in Section 18.08.02 of this chapter in the definition of "functionally dependent use." 
2.  Variances shall not be issued within any floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
3.  Generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the regulatory flood elevation, provided the procedures of Sections 18.08.04 and 18.08.05 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

a. For the purposes of the Section, zoning area means both of the following:
1) The area within on hundred and fifty feet, including all rights-of-way, of the
affected property subject to the proposed amendment or change.
2) The area of the proposed amendment or change.
3. The Council may approve the proposal or changes as recommended by the Commission,
reject them, approve them with additional modifications and/or conditions, or refer the

a public hearing shall be scheduled with the Planning and Zoning Commission to
determine compliance with the schedule for development and to provide a
recommendation to the City Council whether to extend the schedule for development or
cause the zoning to revert to its former classification. A public hearing shall then be
scheduled with the City Council to either take administrative action to extend, remove
or determine compliance with the schedule for development or take legislative action to
cause the property to revert to its former zoning classification. The property owner and
applicant who requested the rezoning shall be sent notification by certified mail
regarding all scheduled public hearings on these matters.

SECTION 302. CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
A. PURPOSE.
Every zoning district contains certain buildings, structures and uses of land which are normal
and complementary to permitted principal uses in the district, but which, by reason of their
typical physical or operational characteristics, influence on the traffic function of adjoining
streets or similar conditions are often incompatible with adjacent activities and uses. It is the
intent of this Ordinance to permit Conditional Uses in appropriate zoning districts, but only
in specific locations within such districts that can be designed and developed in a manner
which assures maximum compatibility with adjoining uses, and where such uses will not be
detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the public. It is the purpose of this Section to
establish principles and procedures essential to proper guidance and control of such uses.
B. GENERAL REGULATIONS.
1. Zoning district regulations established elsewhere in this Ordinance specify that certain
buildings, structures and uses of land may be allowed by the Commission as Permitted
Conditional Uses in a given district subject to the provisions of regulations. The Planning
and Zoning Commission is empowered to grant and to deny applications for Use Permits
and to impose reasonable conditions upon them.
2. Any building, structure or use existing on the effective date of this Ordinance which is
reclassified as a Permitted Conditional Use by this Ordinance for the district in which it
is located shall be considered as meeting the conditions which would otherwise be
imposed upon such use by this Ordinance and its continuance shall not be subject to
issuance of a Conditional Use Permit; provided, however, to the extent that such fails to
conform to the requirements of this Ordinance, it shall be considered nonconforming as
described in this Ordinance and its continuance shall be governed by all nonconforming
use regulations applicable thereto.
C. CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION.
Application for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) shall be filed with the Zoning Administrator
on a form provided by the City. The application shall be forwarded to the Planning and
Zoning Commission by the Zoning Administrator and when required by the Commission,
shall be accompanied by a detailed site plan and related exhibits showing all information
necessary to demonstrate that the proposed use will comply with the required findings and
III-8
all special conditions as well as other regulations and requirements of this Ordinance. The
applicant shall furnish the Commission any additional information it may consider relevant
to investigation of the case.
D. COMMISSION ACTION AND FINDINGS.
1. It is the express intent of this Ordinance that any use for which a Conditional Use Permit
is required shall be permitted as a Principal Use in the particular zoning district, provided
that the required findings and all special conditions and requirements of this Ordinance
are met.
2. Notification: Notice of the Conditional Use Permit application shall be posted on the
property. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and include
a general explanation of the matter to be considered and a general description of the area
affected.
3. A Conditional Use Permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
thereafter run with the land and shall continue to be valid with successor ownership of
the property provided the use is maintained in compliance with the conditions,
stipulations and terms of the permit. If a use ceases to exist for six (6) months or more,
the property owner shall be notified that the CUP shall be subject to possible revocation
as described in this Section. The Planning and Zoning Commission can grant an
extension to the CUP where the intent to continue the use in the same manner is
demonstrated.
4. A Conditional Use Permit may be subject to review and possible revocation where a
violation of the conditions of approval is indicated and where the required findings for
revocation, as described in this Section, are demonstrated.
5. Conditions of Approval: The Commission may designate such conditions in connection
with the Conditional Use Permit as it deems necessary to secure the intent and purposes
of this Ordinance and may require such guarantees and evidence that such conditions are
being or will be complied with.
6. Required Findings. A Conditional Use Permit shall only be granted if the approving body
determines that the project conforms to the required findings in this Section. If it is
determined that it is not possible to confirm the required findings for the proposed CUP,
whether as submitted or through conditions that may be required, the application shall
be denied. The specific basis for any decision shall be established in the record as
findings of fact. The following criteria shall be considered as the basis for the findings
to approve, approve with conditions or deny the Conditional Use Permit:
III-9
a. General Findings: The location, size, design and operational characteristics of the
proposed use shall not be detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the
surrounding properties or occupants, nor be substantially or permanently injurious
to neighboring property;
b. Compatibility with Surrounding Uses: The proposed use shall be compatible with
surrounding uses in the vicinity with respect to the intensity of activity, times of use,
scale of buildings, anticipated traffic, parking requirements, architectural and site
improvements, landscaping, outdoor lighting and other property development
standards;
c. Traffic and Circulation: The proposed use shall have adequate access to public streets
and highways to carry the type and quantity of traffic which may be generated by the

Administrator to issue a Conditional Use Permit setting forth all conditions and
requirements governing such use, shall make the approved site plan and exhibits a part
of the record of the case and shall report its actions to the City Council at the next regular
meeting.
8. Denial: If the Commission finds that the application and supporting data does not
indicate that the required findings will be met, it shall deny the permit. Notice of denial,
including reasons therefore, shall be mailed to the applicant at the address shown on the
application and the Commission shall report its actions to the City Council at the next
regular meeting.
E. APPEALS.

record on application and notice to the Zoning Administrator.

for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence and in

surroundings the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance will deprive such property
of privileges enjoyed by other property of same classification in the same zoning

granting a Variance.
11. Every Variance granted shall be personal to the appellant therefor and shall be
transferred and shall run with the land only after completion of any authorized

The decision of the Board shall be final, provided, however, that any person aggrieved

reviewed.

horizontal dimensions used to determine the slope. The one hundred (100) foot
slope determination lines shall be located perpendicular to the site or property
contour bands. Those properties containing multiple slope planes should provide
slope information for all such planes.
3) To determine those locations where slopes of twenty percent (20%), thirty percent
(30%), and forty percent (40%) begin by the application of one hundred (100) foot
straight lines that fall within each category. The one hundred (100) foot slope
determination lines shall be extended onto adjacent properties to a distance that
establishes the overall slope of the land but in no case shall they be extended less
than twenty (20) feet onto the adjacent properties.
4) Connect the midpoints of each series of one hundred (100) foot lines of the same
slope category to establish the limits of that slope category.
5) Measure the areas resulting between each series of straight lines to determine the
areas in each slope category.
b. Computer Generated Slope Calculation Method:
1) Utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at two (2) foot
intervals.

H. SLOPE DEVELOPMENT.
1. Maximum Site Disturbance: Maximum site disturbance), as used in this Section, shall
include all grading, excavation and fill area for the development of the property but shall
not include any public or private street or the building coverage in the calculation.
Slope Category Maximum Allowable Disturbance Area as per Slope Category Map
0% to 19.9% As per underlying Zoning.
20% to 29.9% 30%
30% - 39.9% 50%
40% & > No Disturbance, except as permitted by this Ordinance.
2. Residential Density: The maximum density for residential development within specified
slope category areas shall be determined by the following:
a. For any portion of land containing slopes below 20%, the maximum density is
determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of land below the 20% slope line by
the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning district/s.
b. For any portion of land containing slopes from 20% up to 29.9%, the maximum density
is 0.70 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of land between
the 20% and 29.9% slope lines by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying
zoning district/s.
c. For any portion of land containing slopes from 30% up to 39.9%, the maximum density
is 0.50 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of land between
the 30% and 39.9%, slope lines by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying
zoning district/s.
III-54
d. For any portion of land containing slopes 40% and greater, the maximum density is
determined as 0.25 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of
land at or above the 40% slope line by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying
zoning district/s.
3. Hillside Residential Density Bonus: For properties where the maximum density for
residential development is limited as established in this Section for development in slope
category areas at or above 20%, the net difference with a potential density bonus increase
in the allowable number of dwelling units may be transferred to other portions of the same
or contiguous development property where such areas are shown as below the 20% slope
category level. For transfer of residential density to zoning districts other than PAD Zone,
development shall otherwise meet all standards of this Ordinance and shall not exceed
more than 125% of the density otherwise allowed in that Zoning District. Transfer of
residential density for projects with PAD Zoning shall be subject to the standard review
and criteria for Planned Area Development as determined through the Master
Development Plan.
4. All such development qualified for transfer of residential density shall be subject to
standards as specified in this Ordinance and the following:
a. In addition to other residential use types allowable in the underlying zoning district,
transferred density rights may be developed as detached single-family residential units
or as attached residential units with townhouse or clustered type design.
b. Proposed clustered unit developments located within a 20% or greater slope category
shall be subject to the processing of a Planned Area Development (PAD) application
and approval at the sole discretion of the City Council.
c. Aspects for consideration of a density transfer design may include but are not limited
to:
1) Locations and distribution of any attached or clustered housing.
2) The condition of buffering or separation between proposed housing and the
abutting properties.
3) The overall variety of housing types, sizes, lot sizes.
4) The amount and quality of natural open space or usable landscaped areas that are
contained within the proposed transfer area.
d. For all areas of the lot or parcel with less than a 20 percent slope, 100 percent site
disturbance may occur where densities are being transferred from higher slope areas.
III-55
5. The following criteria shall be applied for review of proposed clustered development:
a. Minimizes the disturbance to the terrain, avoiding cuts or fills unless they are
necessary.
b. Preserves and incorporates natural features and vegetation, preserves significant large
trees or landscape specimens, preserves rock formations.
c. Mitigates visual impacts by keeping structures below ridgelines, stepping structures
with the slope, and minimizing the height of structures.
d. Building and structure design is compatible with hillside characteristics using natural
materials and colors, and variation with roof and wall components;
I. HILLSIDE DESIGN CRITERIA.
1. Mass Grading Standards. Leveling of large development sites through mass grading shall
be discouraged even for areas with less the 20% slope. Careful design of site grading to
allow stepping of areas within larger development sites is preferred so as to preserve
natural slopes, vegetation and similar features.
2. Construction Envelope. All lots 20,000 square feet or more in net area shall establish a
construction envelope equal to the combined area of the maximum disturbed area and
maximum lot coverage as described in this Section.
3. Spill Slopes. Spill slopes greater in depth than five (5) feet shall be prohibited for
development sites, driveways and streets. All such surplus material shall be removed from
the site or disposed of on-site as permitted by this Ordinance.
4. Removal or disposal of excess material. All excavated material shall be removed from
lots and roadways or contained behind retaining walls or landscaped so that the slopes of
any fill material will not be visible.
5. Cuts and Fills. Stabilization is required for all cut and fill slopes of five (5) feet or greater
in elevation. To reduce visual impacts of cut and fill slopes they should be rounded or
tapered where they meet natural grade so that they blend with the natural slope.
a. Building pad: The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a building site
shall not exceed twelve (12) feet. For cuts greater in height stepping shall be required
with at least four (4) foot steps to allow landscaping.
b. Street: The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a road shall not exceed
12 feet. For cuts greater in height stepping shall be required with at least four (4) foot
steps to allow landscaping. All building sites, driveways and roadway cut and fill
slopes shall be re-vegetated with native plant material.
c. Driveway: Any driveway cut greater than eight (8) feet in depth shall not have a length
greater than one hundred (100) feet; and the maximum height of any cut or fill used to
establish a driveway shall not exceed twelve (12) feet.
III-56
d. Grade of backslope, cuts and fills: The grade for resulting slopes shall be a maximum
2:1, or greater if determined necessary by engineering analysis to ensure a sustainable
slope. A combination of retaining walls and slopes may also be considered.
e. Partial bench construction: Where a grading plan proposes a combination of cuts and
fills to create a level area for a building, road, driveway or development site due to
constraints of the property, a detailed treatment plan shall be required for the cut and
fill sections to ensure adequate compaction of the fill material and a minimum 2:1
backslope grade so as to maintain a stable slope. Any fill material shall be carefully
blended with the prevailing natural grade of the hillside and landscaping shall be
provided as necessary to minimize the visual effects of any spill slope.
f. Setbacks: Both the top of cut slope and toe of slope shall be setback at least 10 feet
from any property line or greater if required by building codes. Exceptions may be
considered where the existing topography or drainage patterns are such that strict
adherence to this standard would result in a less desirable condition for abutting
properties. In such cases a recorded slope or drainage easement shall be provided for
the applicable portions of the abutting property.
g. Alternative cut and fill limitations and methods to mitigate the visual impact of cut
and spill slopes such as terracing, use of retaining walls and re-vegetation of disturbed
areas may be submitted based on a finding that the proposed alternative limitations
and methods meet the intent of this Section to reduce the visual impact of cut and spill
slopes and are otherwise in compliance with this Ordinance. All such alternative
proposals shall be subject to Design Review approval.
6. Retaining walls: The intent of retaining wall standards is to reduce the visual impact of
retaining methods used on hillside developments. Specific criteria for design include the
following:
a. Fill slopes greater than two (2) feet in depth may be contained by a retaining wall as
provided by this Ordinance. Retaining walls may be used to retain fill where slopes
cannot be stabilized by the application of boulders, vegetation or the underlying native
rock.
b. Residential retaining walls shall not exceed six (6) feet in height; non-residential
retaining walls shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height. Where additional height is
required, a series of stepped retaining walls may be used where such walls are offset
at least four (4) feet horizontally. The area between stepped retaining walls shall be
improved with landscaping, as per Section 407. Landscaping Requirements.
c. Decorative view fences, not exceeding 6 (six) feet in height above the highest part of
adjacent natural grade may be added to a retaining wall. View fences may include
wrought iron, wood picket or a combination of wrought iron and masonry columns but
shall not include chain link for such applications.
d. The location and layout of retaining walls shall be designed to compliment the shape
of the natural terrain to the greatest extent possible through the use of stepped or offset
III-57
sections both in elevation and plan view. Retaining walls shall be designed to preserve
attractive areas of existing desert vegetation where possible.
e. If retaining walls are constructed of block or finished with stucco, they should be
colored to blend with surrounding landscape or to be compatible with the development
theme of the project. Rock facing on masonry walls is encouraged and the use of rock
walls comprised of native materials where structurally appropriate is also encouraged.
7. Driveways: The design of driveways located within development projects shall meet the
following standards:
a. Driveways in hillside development areas (20% or greater slopes) shall be limited to
one per residence. A driveway may be used to serve more than one residence where in
compliance with applicable codes.
b. Driveways with 10% grade or greater shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, pavers or
a comparable hardened surface so as to stabilize slopes and minimize erosion and
sedimentation.
c. Driveways with 10% grade or greater shall have a 20 foot minimum landing area at
intersection with maximum 6% grade so as to allow safe transition to street.
d. Driveways with 15% or greater grade shall be constructed of concrete with appropriate
surface treatment to provide adequate friction for vehicles.
e. Where a driveway crosses a wash or drainageway, it shall not impede or adversely
alter drainage. Wash crossings shall be stabilized to minimize maintenance. Where
necessary to accommodate regular run-off or flooding, appropriately sized and
designed culverts or bridging shall be required. For low-flow or local drainage swales,
concrete aprons on each side of the driveway may be approved to accommodate the
cross flow.
f. Drainage culverts: Where driveways cross drainage ditches and channels beside the
roadway, culvert pipes shall be sized to meet all applicable engineering requirements
but in no case shall be less than 12 in size for pipes up to 16 feet in length and
minimum 24 for pipes greater than 16 feet in length. A uniform size of culvert pipe
shall be established for similar drainage crossings to lots accessed across the same
channel along the same roadway.
g. The applicant shall provide engineered plans, prepared by a registered civil engineer,
licensed in the State of Arizona, for all driveways that have grades more than ten (10)
percent to ensure compliance with the design criteria.
8. Street Design: Both public and private streets proposed for new development shall
conform to the following standards for hillside development:
a. Street grade shall be designed to take advantage of the natural topography of the
landscape through such techniques as following the natural contours across hillsides.
III-58
b. All cut and fill slopes associated with new streets shall be within the roadway rightof-
way or roadway easement. Slope maintenance easements for roadway cuts and fills
shall be required where such disturbance extends onto private property.
c. Street grades shall typically not exceed 6%, except where there are exceptional
circumstances of the natural topography that would otherwise limit locating the new
street in a conforming manner then individual sections up to 10% percent grade may
be considered for a maximum length of five-hundred (500) feet. Exceptions for new
streets may be approved by the City Engineer if there are no reasonable alternatives
and the proposed street is in compliance with all other applicable codes and ordinances
and is approved by fire, police and public safety agencies for emergency access.

a. No building, permanent sign, or other structure in a Historic Preservation District or
part of a designated Historic Landmark shall be erected, demolished, moved, restored,
rehabilitated, reconstructed, altered, or changed in exterior appearance, nor shall any
historic resource be altered, moved, remodeled, demolished, enlarged or extended
contrary to the district or landmark until plans for such activities have been submitted
to and approved by the Historic Preservation Commission or as permitted
administratively, and the City has issued a Certificate of Appropriateness, for such
work on the subject property. This requirement is in addition to any other permit or
approval required by law.
III-71
b. Failure to comply with a stipulation, standard, or plan made a part of any of these
approvals shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Cottonwood. An approved plan shall apply to and run with the property and the rights
and responsibilities shall be transferable to future successors and assignees of such
property. No permit shall be issued for any building or structure not in compliance
with the plan, except that temporary facilities shall be permitted in conjunction with
construction. No structure or other element shall be eliminated, or altered or provided
in another manner, unless an amendment is approved in conjunction with the
procedures for original approval.
c. Maintenance of the historic resource is required. Ordinary maintenance or repair of
any structure that does not alter or modify the historic character of the structure will
not require a Certificate of Appropriateness.
I. CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
1. Applicability: A Certificate of Appropriateness is required before commencing any
exterior improvements or development, including alteration, restoration, renovation,
reconstruction, new construction, demolition or removal, in whole or in part, of any
property located within a Historic Preservation Overlay District or to a Historic Landmark,
whether or not the work will require a building permit. Building permits for exterior work
on properties within historic overlay districts or landmarks cannot be issued without first
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness.
2. Exceptions for Minor Work: A Certificate of Appropriateness may be approved
administratively by the Community Development Manager or designee, where it is
determined that the proposed activity constitutes a minor change and does not alter the
essential appearance and character of the property. Activities that may be approved
administratively include, but are not limited to the following: repair or replacement of
architectural features with essentially the same materials and design; repair or replacement
of signs within existing sign panels or frames; repainting with essentially the same design
scheme and colors; or other minor changes or additions that are in conformance with
approved Design Guidelines and are considered minor. In addition to the criteria
described in this Section or in any Design Guidelines approved for historic preservation,
the Commission may authorize staff to approve certain activities administratively. For
projects that qualify for administrative approval, all other application requirements and
review criteria shall remain in effect.
3. Application Submittal and Review Procedure. An application for Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be submitted by the owner or agent of the subject property and
involves the following steps:
a. Preliminary meeting. Prior to the submittal of an application for a Certificate of

J. CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS
1. It is the intent of this Section to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that activities
requiring a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be compatible with the architectural and
historical character of the property or district.
2. Review Context. Review of applications for Certificate of Appropriateness shall be
considered in terms of the specific nature and condition of the property, as well as the

influences of surrounding properties. Context shall be considered based on the following
circumstances:
a. Overlay Zoning District: All properties within a Historic Preservation Overlay Zoning
District shall be subject to the requirements for review and approval of a Certificate of

addition, the applicant shall provide detailed documentation of why the request shall be
considered a hardship, including cost estimates, comparative studies, expert
documentation or other such information as necessary to adequately present such new
information.
a. Is infeasible from a technical, mechanical, or structural standpoint.
b. Would leave the property with no reasonable economic value because it would require
an unreasonable expenditure taking in to account such factors as current market value,
permitted uses of the property, and the cost of compliance with applicable local, state
and federal requirements.
c. Costs necessitated by the neglect or failure of the current owner/s to maintain the
property shall not be considered in making this finding.
d. The Commission finds that the alterations of a contributing property would not have a
substantial adverse impact on the historic significance or integrity of a Historic
Preservation Overlay District.
2. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on the hardship application at their next
regularly scheduled meeting. Decisions at that time shall be final.
M. DEMOLITION OF HISTORIC LANDMARK OR CONTRIBUTING PROPERTY WITHIN
A HISTORIC DISTRICT.
It is the intent of this Section to encourage preservation and protection of historic structures
and significant resources within designated Historic Districts and other designated Historic
Landmarks. However, it is recognized that there can be circumstances beyond the control of
III-76
a property owner which may result in the necessary demolition of a Landmark or structure
within a designated District. These circumstances include a building which constitutes a nonrepairable
public nuisance, which involves a resource whose loss does not adversely affect or
may even benefit the integrity of the District, or which imposes an economic hardship on the
owner. This Section is intended to apply to demolition of buildings or structures and shall not
include demolition permits issued for the purpose of interior remodeling or other purposes not
applicable to the Historic Preservation Ordinance.
1. Non-Historic Demolition: Demolition of non-historic structures within a Historic District
shall not be exempt from the requirements of the Historic Preservation Ordinance and will
require first applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The area of a site left vacant by
a demolition shall be maintained in a manner not detrimental to the surrounding vicinity
in accordance with applicable City codes and ordinances, including dust-free surface
treatment and abatement of weeds, trash, debris, outdoor storage or other public
nuisances.
2. Landmark Demolition: Partial or complete demolition of designated historic properties
and landmarks shall not be permitted without first applying for a Certificate of
Appropriateness. Application for such a demolition shall be made to the Historic
Preservation Commission, which shall hold a public hearing to determine if the applicant
has shown that the preservation of the structure is physically and/or economically
infeasible.
3. Consideration of Alternatives to Demolition: Before granting a request for demolition, the
Commission shall review the historic or cultural value of the property and shall consider
options including incentives to the owner for restoration or recommendation to Council
that the city consider purchasing the property or seek other methods to ensure the
preservation of the building or structure. The Commission shall review the request for
demolition based on the following:
a. The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or by
a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return.
b. Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it have
failed.
c. If preservation is found to be physically and/or economically infeasible, the
Commission shall approve the Certificate of Appropriateness, thereby allowing
issuance of the Demolition Permit by the Community Development Department.
d. A landmark or contributing property may be demolished if the chief building official
has determined that an imminent safety hazard exists and that demolition of the
structure is the only feasible means to secure the public safety.
e. If preservation is considered feasible, the Commission shall delay issuance of the
Certificate of Appropriateness for a period up to ninety (90) days in length so as to
consider alternatives to demolition.
f. The applicant, at their cost, may submit an independent third-party review of the
structural integrity of the building or structure in relation to necessary improvements
III-77
so as to determine the feasibility of alternatives to demolition. Such independent
review shall be conducted by a registered professional in the State of Arizona,
including an architect, structural engineer or other professional engineer, or other with
demonstrated expertise in historic preservation and rehabilitation.
g. During the delay period, the applicant shall consult in good faith with the Commission,
City staff, the State Historic Preservation Office, local and state preservation groups
and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative that will result in
preservation or sale of the property so as to promote preservation. The applicant shall
have ninety (90) days in which to advertise to have the property purchased at a fair
market value or to receive appraisals, cost estimates, and proposals on the restoration
of such properties.
h. If no purchaser has been found within the initial ninety (90) day period and no other
plan is shown to demonstrate a reasonable alternative, then the Certificate of
Appropriateness for the proposed demolition shall be issued.
i. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof for all findings required for approval of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
j. If a preservation plan is presented to the Commission within the delay period specified
above by any interested party who may be any member of the public, indicating a
feasible and reasonable approach to saving a threatened historic resource, the
Commission will consider the merits and feasibility of the preservation plan. The
Commission may decide to provide copies of such preservation plan to the property
owner so as to consider alternatives to demolition.
k. In making its decision, the Commission shall consider testimony and the effects on the
surrounding neighborhood, and advise the property owner on preservation
alternatives.
l. The property owner shall have twenty-one (21) days from the date of approval to sign
the Certificate of Appropriateness or to appeal any conditions contained therein.
N. FINDING OF HARDSHIP FOR DEMOLITION.
1. Economic Hardship Criteria for Demolition of Historic Structures. Separate standards and
application requirements may be established by the city for granting economic hardship
relief for income-producing properties and for non-income producing properties. The
Commission shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness if the Commission finds, after
review, that maintenance, use and/or alteration of the designated property in accordance
with the requirements of this article would cause immediate and substantial hardship on
the property owner/s based on one or more of the following issues:
a. That a temporary delay period of up to ninety (90) days has elapsed and no reasonable
alternative has been demonstrated by the applicant, the City, or any other interested
parties.
b. Is infeasible from a technical, mechanical, or structural standpoint;
III-78
c. Would leave the property with no reasonable economic value because it would require
an unreasonable expenditure taking in to account such factors as current market value,
permitted uses of the property, and the cost of compliance with applicable local, state
and federal requirements;
d. Costs necessitated by the neglect or failure of the current owner/s to maintain the
property need not be considered in making this finding; and/or
e. The Commission finds that the demolition of a contributing property would not have
a substantial adverse impact on the historic significance or integrity of a Historic
Preservation Overlay District.
2. Limitations on Economic Hardship Criteria: Demonstration of an economic hardship shall
not be based on or include any of the following circumstances:
a. Willful or negligent acts by the owner.
b. Purchase of the property for substantially more than market value.
c. Failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs.
d. Failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants.
e. Failure to provide normal improvements.
O. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
Each property designated as a landmark, and properties designated as contributing properties
within a Historic Preservation Overlay District shall be maintained in good condition and
faithful to its historic character. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent normal
maintenance and repair of any exterior feature of any structure designated as a landmark or
contributing property within a HP District, which does not involve change in design, material,
color or outward appearance. The Commission shall not consider the interior arrangements or
alterations to the interior of a building, unless designation specifically includes the interior or
a portion thereof.
P. APPEALS.
Any person or persons aggrieved by a decision of the Commission may appeal to the City
Council within fifteen (15) working days of the Commissions action, by filing with the City
Clerk written notice of appeal and any applicable fee as may be adopted. The Council shall
render a decision to sustain, conditionally overrule or overrule the Commission decision. The
Council may choose to hold a public hearing if deemed appropriate.
Q. VIOLATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT.
III-79
All work performed pursuant to this Section shall conform to requirements thereof.
Compliance shall be confirmed by inspections made by the City of Cottonwood officials,
including the Building Official, Manager or designee. The appropriate City officials shall
ensure that all matters are undertaken according to conditions of the approved plans.
Noncompliance with the approved plans shall be grounds for stopping work on the project or
for denial of a Certificate of Occupancy. Any person who causes unauthorized demolition,
alteration, construction, or permits degradation or disrepair of a designated property as defined
in this Section may be required to restore the property and site to its condition prior to the
violation.
R. SEVERABILITY.
This article and its sections are hereby declared to be severable. If any section, subsection,
clause, word or phrase of this article is held to be void, unlawful or unconstitutional, such
holdings shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this article or of the Zoning
Ordinance.
III-80
SECTION 311. CERTIFICATE OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
A. PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
The purpose of the Certificate of Zoning Compliance is to ensure that all conditions of

review conditions for compliance with requirements. If all conditions are met, the Director
shall issue a Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
2. Issuance of Certificate: The Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall provide
documentation of compliance with conditions of approval for development applications.
The Certificate shall indicate the property location and provide a project description. In
addition, it shall indicate what use or occupancy is permissible and specify that the
applicable conditions of approval have been met. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance may
be issued for a phase of a project where such phased development is approved through the
development approval process.
3. Time Frame: The Certificate of Zoning Compliance shall be subject to meeting a time
frame for completion of conditions, as specified by the approving authority. If the
conditions have not been met after the required time frame for completion, the Certificate
of Zoning Compliance shall not be issued and the continued use of the property shall be
deemed to be in violation of City regulations subject to enforcement by applicable
procedures, including revocation of a Conditional Use Permit or other zoning approvals.
4. Extension of Time: The Community Development Director may administratively approve
an extension of time for up to six (6) months to complete the required conditions provided
the project is active and current with regards to building permits and development activity.
For additional time, the applicant will need to request an extension from the Planning and
Zoning Commission or authorizing body.
5. Statement of Findings: If a Certificate of Zoning Compliance cannot be issued, a
statement of the specific points of noncompliance, described as the findings of fact, shall
be issued by the City stating the reasons the Certificate cannot be issued and the conditions
necessary to achieve compliance, including the time frame for completion, alternate
methods of remedy and rights of appeal.
6. Decision: If the required conditions of approval are not established within the time frame
specified for completion, or if no attempt is made to comply with required conditions, and
all other remedies offered for compliance are unsuccessful, the Certificate of Zoning
Compliance shall not be issued by the Community Development Director. The failure to
implement the conditions necessary for approval of the Certificate within the time frame
specified, or after any extensions of time granted, shall be deemed to be a violation of City
regulations subject to enforcement by applicable procedures, including revocation of a
Conditional Use Permit or other zoning approvals.
7. Limitations: A Certificate of Zoning Compliance issued in conformance with this
Ordinance does not imply approval for any other permits or actions that may be required
by other departments, agencies or parties, and which are otherwise the responsibility of
the property owner, developer or applicable representative to obtain.
D. REVOCATION.
III-82
1. In addition to any other enforcement procedures which may applicable, a Certificate of
Zoning Compliance granted in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance may be
revoked at a later date if the conditions or terms of the Certificate are violated.

violation, the Community Development Director shall re-inspect the property and if
satisfactory, shall confirm the approved status of the Certificate of Zoning Compliance.
3. The failure of an applicant to reinstate a Certificate of Compliance after thirty (30) days
notice shall be deemed to be a violation of City regulations subject to enforcement by
applicable procedures, including revocation of a Conditional Use Permit or other zoning
approvals.
4. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance that has been revoked shall be considered null and
void and the continued use of the property for the uses indicated shall be deemed a
violation of City regulations subject to enforcement by applicable procedures.
E. APPEAL.

request for the Administrative Waiver to all owners of real property within three
hundred (300) feet of the subject property within three (3) business days of submittal of
the application and provide at least 10 days for response.
5. Conditions for Approval: The Zoning Administrator may authorize an Administrative
Waiver when a literal enforcement of the provision(s) of this Section and all
amendments thereof, would result in unnecessary property hardship and when evidence
is presented demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that all of
the following conditions are fulfilled:
a. The requested modification will not be detrimental to persons residing or working
in the vicinity, to adjacent property, to the neighborhood, or to the public welfare
in general;
b. The granted Administrative Waiver is the minimum development standard
modification that will make possible the reasonable use of the land and/or structure;
c. Granting the waiver will be based on the physical constraints and land use
specifics, rather than on economic hardship claimed by the applicant; and
d. Appropriate and specific conditions as may be deemed necessary in order to fully
carry out the intent of the Administrative Waiver section of the Zoning Ordinance
have been stipulated by the Zoning Administrator.
6. Appeal. The applicant may appeal any decision of the Zoning Administrator to the
Board of Adjustment in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 306,
Appeals and Variances.
7. Revocation. A violation of any condition stipulated by the Zoning Administrator that is
not corrected within a specified timeframe shall render the granted Administrative
Waiver null and void. An approval shall also be null and void if the use has not
commenced or if a grading or building permit has not been obtained for the related

methodology shall provide both a written explanation of the proposed alternative
methodology and a graphical example of its use.
4. A Slope Calculation Map shall be produced for the review slope categories as applies
to the hillside development standards. The slope map shall contain information
necessary to determine compliance with this Section. To determine the location and
extent of slope categories, carry out one of the following procedures:
a. Manual Slope Calculation Method:
1) Utilize a topographic map at a scale of twenty (20) feet or less to the inch and
with contours shown at two (2) foot intervals. All contour lines shall be
extended onto adjacent properties to a distance that establishes the overall slope
of the land but in no case shall they be extended less than twenty (20) feet onto
the adjacent properties.
2) The slope category shall commence at the midpoint of the one hundred (100)
foot horizontal dimensions used to determine the slope. The one hundred (100)
foot slope determination lines shall be located perpendicular to the site or
property contour bands. Those properties containing multiple slope planes
should provide slope information for all such planes.
3) To determine those locations where slopes of twenty percent (20%), thirty
percent (30%), and forty percent (40%) begin by the application of one hundred
(100) foot straight lines that fall within each category. The one hundred (100)
foot slope determination lines shall be extended onto adjacent properties to a
distance that establishes the overall slope of the land but in no case shall they be
extended less than twenty (20) feet onto the adjacent properties.
4) Connect the midpoints of each series of one hundred (100) foot lines of the
same slope category to establish the limits of that slope category.
5) Measure the areas resulting between each series of straight lines to determine
the areas in each slope category.
b. Computer Generated Slope Calculation Method:
1) Utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at two (2) foot
intervals.
2) Utilizing a slope generating software application, slope categories shall be
determined utilizing the slope categories identified in this Ordinance.
3) Computer generated slope analyses shall be prepared utilizing the following
modeling parameters:
(a) Maximum five (5) foot slope contour intervals for slopes more than thirty
percent (30%);
7
(b) The slope analysis shall utilize the above noted slope contour intervals
through the modeling basis of grid evaluation to determine slope facets or
contours; and,
(c) The analysis shall utilize a twenty-five (25) foot grid system.
4) All data generated through the use of a computer generated slope
determination shall be presented in both chart and graphic formats. The
presentation of all graphic slope information shall be presented in a clear and
easily understandable format.
5) The final map shall be plotted at a maximum scale of 1 = 200 and submitted
to the Community Development Director or designee for review. If the
Community Development Director or designee finds the analysis acceptable,
the final slope determination map shall be approved.
6) The Community Development Director or designee may reject the analysis
and require correction(s) to the digitized slope category lines to more
accurately reflect the generalized slope conditions of the property or other
revisions necessary to ensure compliance with this Section.
H. SLOPE DEVELOPMENT.
1. Maximum Site Disturbance: Maximum site disturbance), as used in this Section, shall
include all grading, excavation and fill area for the development of the property but
shall not include any public or private street or the building coverage in the calculation.
Slope Category Maximum Allowable Disturbance Area as per Slope Category Map
0% to 19.9% As per underlying Zoning.
20% to 29.9% 30%
30% - 39.9% 50%
40% & > No Disturbance, except as permitted by this Ordinance.
2. Residential Density: The maximum density for residential development within
specified slope category areas shall be determined by the following:
a. For any portion of land containing slopes below 20%, the maximum density is
determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of land below the 20% slope line
by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning district/s.
b. For any portion of land containing slopes from 20% up to 29.9%, the maximum
density is 0.70 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of
land between the 20% and 29.9% slope lines by the minimum lot size specified in
the underlying zoning district/s.
c. For any portion of land containing slopes from 30% up to 39.9%, the maximum
density is 0.50 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract of
land between the 30% and 39.9%, slope lines by the minimum lot size specified in
the underlying zoning district/s.
8
d. For any portion of land containing slopes 40% and greater, the maximum density is
determined as 0.25 of the density determined by dividing the gross area of the tract
of land at or above the 40% slope line by the minimum lot size specified in the
underlying zoning district/s.
3. Hillside Residential Density Bonus: For properties where the maximum density for
residential development is limited as established in this Section for development in
slope category areas at or above 20%, the net difference with a potential density bonus
increase in the allowable number of dwelling units may be transferred to other portions
of the same or contiguous development property where such areas are shown as below
the 20% slope category level. For transfer of residential density to zoning districts
other than PAD Zone, development shall otherwise meet all standards of this
Ordinance and shall not exceed more than 125% of the density otherwise allowed in
that Zoning District. Transfer of residential density for projects with PAD Zoning shall
be subject to the standard review and criteria for Planned Area Development as
determined through the Master Development Plan.
4. All such development qualified for transfer of residential density shall be subject to
standards as specified in this Ordinance and the following:
a. In addition to other residential use types allowable in the underlying zoning district,
transferred density rights may be developed as detached single-family residential
units or as attached residential units with townhouse or clustered type design.
b. Proposed clustered unit developments located within a 20% or greater slope
category shall be subject to the processing of a Planned Area Development (PAD)
application and approval at the sole discretion of the City Council.
c. Aspects for consideration of a density transfer design may include but are not
limited to:
1) Locations and distribution of any attached or clustered housing.
2) The condition of buffering or separation between proposed housing and the
abutting properties.
3) The overall variety of housing types, sizes, lot sizes.
4) The amount and quality of natural open space or usable landscaped areas that
are contained within the proposed transfer area.
d. For all areas of the lot or parcel with less than a 20 percent slope, 100 percent site
disturbance may occur where densities are being transferred from higher slope
areas.
9
4. The following criteria shall be applied for review of proposed clustered development:
a. Minimizes the disturbance to the terrain, avoiding cuts or fills unless they are
necessary.
b. Preserves and incorporates natural features and vegetation, preserves significant
large trees or landscape specimens, preserves rock formations.
c. Mitigates visual impacts by keeping structures below ridgelines, stepping structures
with the slope, and minimizing the height of structures.
d. Building and structure design is compatible with hillside characteristics using
natural materials and colors, and variation with roof and wall components;
I. HILLSIDE DESIGN CRITERIA.
1. Mass Grading Standards. Leveling of large development sites through mass grading
shall be discouraged even for areas with less the 20% slope. Careful design of site
grading to allow stepping of areas within larger development sites is preferred so as to
preserve natural slopes, vegetation and similar features.
2. Construction Envelope. All lots 20,000 square feet or more in net area shall establish a
construction envelope equal to the combined area of the maximum disturbed area and
maximum lot coverage as described in this Section.
3. Spill Slopes. Spill slopes greater in depth than five (5) feet shall be prohibited for
development sites, driveways and streets. All such surplus material shall be removed
from the site or disposed of on-site as permitted by this Ordinance.
4. Removal or disposal of excess material. All excavated material shall be removed from
lots and roadways or contained behind retaining walls or landscaped so that the slopes
of any fill material will not be visible.
5. Cuts and Fills. Stabilization is required for all cut and fill slopes of five (5) feet or
greater in elevation. To reduce visual impacts of cut and fill slopes they should be
rounded or tapered where they meet natural grade so that they blend with the natural
slope.
a. Building pad: The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a building
site shall not exceed twelve (12) feet. For cuts greater in height stepping shall be
required with at least four (4) foot steps to allow landscaping.
b. Street: The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a road shall not
exceed 12 feet. For cuts greater in height stepping shall be required with at least
four (4) foot steps to allow landscaping. All building sites, driveways and roadway
cut and fill slopes shall be re-vegetated with native plant material.
10
c. Driveway: Any driveway cut greater than eight (8) feet in depth shall not have a
length greater than one hundred (100) feet; and the maximum height of any cut or
fill used to establish a driveway shall not exceed twelve (12) feet.
d. Grade of backslope, cuts and fills: The grade for resulting slopes shall be a
maximum 2:1, or greater if determined necessary by engineering analysis to ensure
a sustainable slope. A combination of retaining walls and slopes may also be
considered.
e. Partial bench construction: Where a grading plan proposes a combination of cuts
and fills to create a level area for a building, road, driveway or development site
due to constraints of the property, a detailed treatment plan shall be required for the
cut and fill sections to ensure adequate compaction of the fill material and a
minimum 2:1 backslope grade so as to maintain a stable slope. Any fill material
shall be carefully blended with the prevailing natural grade of the hillside and
landscaping shall be provided as necessary to minimize the visual effects of any
spill slope.
f. Setbacks: Both the top of cut slope and toe of slope shall be setback at least 10 feet
from any property line or greater if required by building codes. Exceptions may be
considered where the existing topography or drainage patterns are such that strict
adherence to this standard would result in a less desirable condition for abutting
properties. In such cases a recorded slope or drainage easement shall be provided
for the applicable portions of the abutting property.
g. Alternative cut and fill limitations and methods to mitigate the visual impact of cut
and spill slopes such as terracing, use of retaining walls and re-vegetation of
disturbed areas may be submitted based on a finding that the proposed alternative
limitations and methods meet the intent of this Section to reduce the visual impact
of cut and spill slopes and are otherwise in compliance with this Ordinance. All
such alternative proposals shall be subject to Design Review approval.
6. Retaining walls: The intent of retaining wall standards is to reduce the visual impact of
retaining methods used on hillside developments. Specific criteria for design include
the following:
a. Fill slopes greater than two (2) feet in depth may be contained by a retaining wall
as provided by this Ordinance. Retaining walls may be used to retain fill where
slopes cannot be stabilized by the application of boulders, vegetation or the
underlying native rock.
b. Residential retaining walls shall not exceed six (6) feet in height; non-residential
retaining walls shall not exceed eight (8) feet in height. Where additional height is
required, a series of stepped retaining walls may be used where such walls are
offset at least four (4) feet horizontally. The area between stepped retaining walls
shall be improved with landscaping, as per Section 407. Landscaping
Requirements.
11
c. Decorative view fences, not exceeding 6 (six) feet in height above the highest part
of adjacent natural grade may be added to a retaining wall. View fences may
include wrought iron, wood picket or a combination of wrought iron and masonry
columns but shall not include chain link for such applications.
d. The location and layout of retaining walls shall be designed to compliment the
shape of the natural terrain to the greatest extent possible through the use of
stepped or offset sections both in elevation and plan view. Retaining walls shall be
designed to preserve attractive areas of existing desert vegetation where possible.
e. If retaining walls are constructed of block or finished with stucco, they should be
colored to blend with surrounding landscape or to be compatible with the
development theme of the project. Rock facing on masonry walls is encouraged
and the use of rock walls comprised of native materials where structurally
appropriate is also encouraged.
5. Driveways: The design of driveways located within development projects shall meet
the following standards:
b. Driveways in hillside development areas (20% or greater slopes) shall be limited to
one per residence. A driveway may be used to serve more than one residence where
in compliance with applicable codes.
c. Driveways with 10% grade or greater shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, pavers
or a comparable hardened surface so as to stabilize slopes and minimize erosion
and sedimentation.
d. Driveways with 10% grade or greater shall have a 20 foot minimum landing area at
intersection with maximum 6% grade so as to allow safe transition to street.
e. Driveways with 15% or greater grade shall be constructed of concrete with
appropriate surface treatment to provide adequate friction for vehicles.
f. Where a driveway crosses a wash or drainageway, it shall not impede or adversely
alter drainage. Wash crossings shall be stabilized to minimize maintenance. Where
necessary to accommodate regular run-off or flooding, appropriately sized and
designed culverts or bridging shall be required. For low-flow or local drainage
swales, concrete aprons on each side of the driveway may be approved to
accommodate the cross flow.
g. Drainage culverts: Where driveways cross drainage ditches and channels beside the
roadway, culvert pipes shall be sized to meet all applicable engineering
requirements but in no case shall be less than 12 in size for pipes up to 16 feet in
length and minimum 24 for pipes greater than 16 feet in length. A uniform size of
culvert pipe shall be established for similar drainage crossings to lots accessed
across the same channel along the same roadway.
12
h. The applicant shall provide engineered plans, prepared by a registered civil
engineer, licensed in the State of Arizona, for all driveways that have grades more
than ten (10) percent to ensure compliance with the design criteria.
6. Street Design: Both public and private streets proposed for new development shall
conform to the following standards for hillside development:
a. Street grade shall be designed to take advantage of the natural topography of the
landscape through such techniques as following the natural contours across
hillsides.
b. All cut and fill slopes associated with new streets shall be within the roadway rightof-
way or roadway easement. Slope maintenance easements for roadway cuts and
fills shall be required where such disturbance extends onto private property.
c. Street grades shall typically not exceed 6%, except where there are exceptional
circumstances of the natural topography that would otherwise limit locating the
new street in a conforming manner then individual sections up to 10% percent
grade may be considered for a maximum length of five-hundred (500) feet.
Exceptions for new streets may be approved by the City Engineer if there are no
reasonable alternatives and the proposed street is in compliance with all other
applicable codes and ordinances and is approved by fire, police and public safety
agencies for emergency access.

H. DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES FOR LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
1. Applicability. The provisions of this Section shall apply to Historic Landmarks and to
properties within a Historic Preservation Overlay District.
2. Alteration of Historic Resources:
a. No building, permanent sign, or other structure in a Historic Preservation District
or part of a designated Historic Landmark shall be erected, demolished, moved,
restored, rehabilitated, reconstructed, altered, or changed in exterior appearance,
nor shall any historic resource be altered, moved, remodeled, demolished, enlarged
or extended contrary to the district or landmark until plans for such activities have
been submitted to and approved by the Historic Preservation Commission or as
permitted administratively, and the City has issued a Certificate of
Appropriateness, for such work on the subject property. This requirement is in
addition to any other permit or approval required by law.
b. Failure to comply with a stipulation, standard, or plan made a part of any of these
approvals shall constitute a violation of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Cottonwood. An approved plan shall apply to and run with the property and the
rights and responsibilities shall be transferable to future successors and assignees of
such property. No permit shall be issued for any building or structure not in
compliance with the plan, except that temporary facilities shall be permitted in
conjunction with construction. No structure or other element shall be eliminated, or
altered or provided in another manner, unless an amendment is approved in
conjunction with the procedures for original approval.
c. Maintenance of the historic resource is required. Ordinary maintenance or repair of
any structure that does not alter or modify the historic character of the structure will
not require a Certificate of Appropriateness.
I. CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.

exterior improvements or development, including alteration, restoration, renovation,
reconstruction, new construction, demolition or removal, in whole or in part, of any
property located within a Historic Preservation Overlay District or to a Historic
Landmark, whether or not the work will require a building permit. Building permits for
exterior work on properties within historic overlay districts or landmarks cannot be
issued without first obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness.
2. Exceptions for Minor Work: A Certificate of Appropriateness may be approved
administratively by the Community Development Manager or designee, where it is
determined that the proposed activity constitutes a minor change and does not alter the
essential appearance and character of the property. Activities that may be approved
administratively include, but are not limited to the following: repair or replacement of
architectural features with essentially the same materials and design; repair or
replacement of signs within existing sign panels or frames; repainting with essentially
the same design scheme and colors; or other minor changes or additions that are in
56-44
conformance with approved Design Guidelines and are considered minor. In addition
to the criteria described in this Section or in any Design Guidelines approved for
historic preservation, the Commission may authorize staff to approve certain activities
administratively. For projects that qualify for administrative approval, all other
application requirements and review criteria shall remain in effect.
3. Application Submittal and Review Procedure. An application for Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be submitted by the owner or agent of the subject property and
involves the following steps:

M. DEMOLITION OF HISTORIC LANDMARK OR CONTRIBUTING PROPERTY
WITHIN A HISTORIC DISTRICT.
It is the intent of this Section to encourage preservation and protection of historic
structures and significant resources within designated Historic Districts and other
designated Historic Landmarks. However, it is recognized that there can be circumstances
beyond the control of a property owner which may result in the necessary demolition of a
Landmark or structure within a designated District. These circumstances include a building
which constitutes a non-repairable public nuisance, which involves a resource whose loss
does not adversely affect or may even benefit the integrity of the District, or which
imposes an economic hardship on the owner. This Section is intended to apply to
demolition of buildings or structures and shall not include demolition permits issued for
the purpose of interior remodeling or other purposes not applicable to the Historic
Preservation Ordinance.
1. Non-Historic Demolition: Demolition of non-historic structures within a Historic
District shall not be exempt from the requirements of the Historic Preservation
Ordinance and will require first applying for a Certificate of Appropriateness. The area
of a site left vacant by a demolition shall be maintained in a manner not detrimental to
the surrounding vicinity in accordance with applicable City codes and ordinances,
including dust-free surface treatment and abatement of weeds, trash, debris, outdoor
storage or other public nuisances.
2. Landmark Demolition: Partial or complete demolition of designated historic properties
and landmarks shall not be permitted without first applying for a Certificate of
Appropriateness. Application for such a demolition shall be made to the Historic
Preservation Commission, which shall hold a public hearing to determine if the
applicant has shown that the preservation of the structure is physically and/or
economically infeasible.
3. Consideration of Alternatives to Demolition: Before granting a request for demolition,
the Commission shall review the historic or cultural value of the property and shall
consider options including incentives to the owner for restoration or recommendation
to Council that the city consider purchasing the property or seek other methods to
ensure the preservation of the building or structure. The Commission shall review the
request for demolition based on the following:
56-49
a. The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the current owner or
by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable return.
b. Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property and preserving it
have failed.
c. If preservation is found to be physically and/or economically infeasible, the
Commission shall approve the Certificate of Appropriateness, thereby allowing
issuance of the Demolition Permit by the Community Development Department.
d. A landmark or contributing property may be demolished if the chief building
official has determined that an imminent safety hazard exists and that demolition of
the structure is the only feasible means to secure the public safety.
e. If preservation is considered feasible, the Commission shall delay issuance of the
Certificate of Appropriateness for a period up to ninety (90) days in length so as to
consider alternatives to demolition.
f. The applicant, at their cost, may submit an independent third-party review of the
structural integrity of the building or structure in relation to necessary
improvements so as to determine the feasibility of alternatives to demolition. Such
independent review shall be conducted by a registered professional in the State of
Arizona, including an architect, structural engineer or other professional engineer,
or other with demonstrated expertise in historic preservation and rehabilitation.
g. During the delay period, the applicant shall consult in good faith with the
Commission, City staff, the State Historic Preservation Office, local and state
preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort to seek an alternative
that will result in preservation or sale of the property so as to promote preservation.
The applicant shall have ninety (90) days in which to advertise to have the property
purchased at a fair market value or to receive appraisals, cost estimates, and
proposals on the restoration of such properties.
h. If no purchaser has been found within the initial ninety (90) day period and no
other plan is shown to demonstrate a reasonable alternative, then the Certificate of
Appropriateness for the proposed demolition shall be issued.
i. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof for all findings required for approval of
a Certificate of Appropriateness.
j. If a preservation plan is presented to the Commission within the delay period
specified above by any interested party who may be any member of the public,
indicating a feasible and reasonable approach to saving a threatened historic
resource, the Commission will consider the merits and feasibility of the
preservation plan. The Commission may decide to provide copies of such
preservation plan to the property owner so as to consider alternatives to demolition.
56-50
k. In making its decision, the Commission shall consider testimony and the effects on
the surrounding neighborhood, and advise the property owner on preservation
alternatives.
l. The property owner shall have twenty-one (21) days from the date of approval to
sign the Certificate of Appropriateness or to appeal any conditions contained
therein.
N. FINDING OF HARDSHIP FOR DEMOLITION.
1. Economic Hardship Criteria for Demolition of Historic Structures. Separate standards
and application requirements may be established by the city for granting economic
hardship relief for income-producing properties and for non-income producing
properties. The Commission shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness if the
Commission finds, after review, that maintenance, use and/or alteration of the
designated property in accordance with the requirements of this article would cause
immediate and substantial hardship on the property owner/s based on one or more of
the following issues:
a. That a temporary delay period of up to ninety (90) days has elapsed and no
reasonable alternative has been demonstrated by the applicant, the City, or any
other interested parties.
b. Is infeasible from a technical, mechanical, or structural standpoint;
c. Would leave the property with no reasonable economic value because it would
require an unreasonable expenditure taking in to account such factors as current
market value, permitted uses of the property, and the cost of compliance with
applicable local, state and federal requirements;
d. Costs necessitated by the neglect or failure of the current owner/s to maintain the
property need not be considered in making this finding; and/or
e. The Commission finds that the demolition of a contributing property would not
have a substantial adverse impact on the historic significance or integrity of a
Historic Preservation Overlay District.
2. Limitations on Economic Hardship Criteria: Demonstration of an economic hardship
shall not be based on or include any of the following circumstances:
a. Willful or negligent acts by the owner.
b. Purchase of the property for substantially more than market value.
c. Failure to perform normal maintenance and repairs.
d. Failure to diligently solicit and retain tenants.
e. Failure to provide normal improvements.
56-51
O. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
Each property designated as a landmark, and properties designated as contributing
properties within a Historic Preservation Overlay District shall be maintained in good

SECTION 406. PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
A. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Section is to alleviate or prevent congestion of the public streets and to
promote the safety and welfare of the public by establishing minimum requirements for the
off-street parking of motor vehicles in accordance with the use to which the property is put.
It is the further purpose of this Section to place upon the property owner the primary
responsibility for relieving public streets of the burden of on street parking.
B. GENERAL REGULATIONS.
1. Size: A parking space shall mean an area of not less than one hundred eighty (180)
square feet, with a minimum width of nine (9) feet and a minimum depth of twenty
(20) feet, which is specifically designated for and used for, the parking of an
automobile or light truck, exclusive of all driveways and access ways.
2. Permits: An applicant for a building permit must submit plans showing the off-street
parking required by this Subsection. These plans must show location, arrangement and
dimensions of the off-street parking, turning spaces, drives, aisles and ingress and
egress and must be approved by the Zoning Administrator and/or Development Review
Board in accordance with the provisions of Sections 304 and 305. Whenever a permit
has been issued in compliance with the requirements of this Section, subsequent use of
the structure, or use of land is conditioned upon the unqualified availability of
off-street parking as shown in the plans submitted prerequisite to receiving the permit.
3. Alterations and additions:
a. A new use, addition or alteration to a building shall not be approved if it would
create or increase a deficit in off-street parking.
b. It is unlawful to reduce the amount of existing parking below the minimum
required by this Section without first supplying other spaces as are required.
c. When a use which does not conform to the off-street parking requirements of this
Ordinance is extended or changed, parking spaces in addition to those already
provided shall be required only for the increased needs generated by the extension
or change.
4. All garages or other space allocated for the parking of vehicles, within buildings,
basements or on roofs of buildings, shall be considered part of the off-street parking
facilities and may be included as such in computing the parking area requirements.
5. Access: All off-street parking shall have access from a public street or alley.
6. Design: Ingress, egress, internal traffic circulation, off-street parking and loading
facilities and pedestrian ways shall be designed so as to promote safety and
convenience so that traffic visibility is not obstructed.
88
7. Exceptions for uses located near public parking lots: The Community Development
Director may administratively approve a reduction of up to 50% of required off-street
parking for non-residential uses located within 300 feet of a City of Cottonwood owned
public parking lot, as measured from the building entrance to the parking lot. Appeal of
the decision of the Director shall be to the Planning and Zoning Commission.

one-way traffic and not less than twenty (20) feet wide for two-way traffic.
2. All uses except as provided above:
a. Location: Required off-street parking shall be located within three hundred (300)
feet of the building or use it is intended to serve, the distance being measured along
the street line from the nearest point of the building or use to the nearest point of
the parking lot.
b. Off-site parking: The Community Development Director may approve the location
of required off street parking spaces on a separate lot from the lot on which the
principal use is located subject to the following conditions:
(1) Off-site parking spaces shall be located within three hundred (300) feet of the
primary entrance of the use served and adequate, safe and convenient
pedestrian access shall be provided from the parking area to the use.
(2) Off-site parking shall not be permitted for residential uses unless approved
through a Planned Area Development rezoning. Required handicap-accessible
parking spaces shall not be located off-site.
(3) Off-site parking must be located within a zoning classification that permits the
parking lot use and all other requirements of site development must be met.
(4) Off-site Parking Agreement: The developer(s) shall submit a written
agreement requiring that the off-site parking spaces shall be maintained as
long as the uses requiring the parking exist or unless the required parking is
provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. Such
written agreement addressing the rights and responsibilities for each property
shall be submitted to the Community Development Director and approved by
the City Attorney for recordation by the Yavapai County Recorder prior to the
89
issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy, and prior to
establishment of the use(s). A copy of the recorded agreement shall be filed in

i) Provide that the agreement may not be cancelled or modified without the
Citys approval.
c. Off-Street Parking Spaces shall be situated in a manner which will not result in
automobiles backing onto a public street, except the Community Development
Director and the City Engineer may administratively waive this requirement under
the following conditions:
1) The road is unlikely to be extended in the future due to geographical, legal, or
other limitations.
2) The location is within 1,500 feet of the end of a street and the Average Daily
Trips (ADT) of the street is less than 1,000.
3) The back out parking would not create any safety hazards such as site distance
issues, etc., as determined by staff.
4) The speed limit of the street is 25mph or less.
d. Surfacing: All off-street parking areas, access ways and driveways shall be
improved with compacted ABC base, not less than four (4) inches thick and
surfaced with a minimum 2" asphaltic concrete in a manner satisfactory to the City
Engineer. The surfacing of the parking area shall be of sufficient grade so that
there will be no impoundment of surface water and all surface drainage shall be
into a public street or improved drainage channel or structure. This performance
90
criteria applies to all new developments requiring more than ten (10) new parking
spaces. New developments requiring ten (10) or fewer parking spaces and
additions or expansions to existing developments may use a chip seal treatment.
New developments requiring more than ten (10) new parking spaces may request
the use of a chip seal treatment to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
Commission will evaluate the request based on the nature of the use, the amount of
traffic generated or expected, the grading and drainage plan for the parking lot and
other relevant factors.
e. Curbing: A six (6) inch wide by six (6) inch high curb or bumper guard shall be
installed where necessary to ensure that no part of a vehicle shall extend over or
beyond a property line, except where a common parking lot, established by an
agreement between abutting properties, crosses a property line.
f. Design: The parking lot shall be designed in a manner to ensure compliance with
Paragraph G. of this Section and with the Landscaping Requirements of Section
407. Design of the parking lot is subject to approval of the Development Review
Board.
g. Access: Access to off-street parking from a public or private street shall be from a
two-way driveway with a minimum width of 24 feet and a maximum width of 32
feet, or two one-way driveways each with a minimum width of 12 feet and a
maximum width of 20 feet. No access driveway shall be located closer than 150
feet from a street intersection, or closer than 20 feet from another access driveway,
or closer than 10 feet from an interior property line. At locations where the
minimum driveway distance is not attainable due to property size, configuration, or
other factors as determined by staff, a reduced minimum driveway location may be
allowed if approved by the Community Development Director and the City
Engineer.
91
h. Dimensions: Arrangements of parking spaces within the parking lot and driveway
widths shall conform to the following requirements:
Note: The front two (2) feet of the parking space may project into landscaped areas

requirements may be granted by the Community Development Director after the
applicant shows that:
A. Because of the unique nature of the specific existing or proposed land use, the
size, shape, or location of the property, or due to an unusually large number of
pedestrian or transit trips, below-normal parking demands will be generated; and
B. The reduced parking supply will still accommodate the vehicular traffic without
increasing traffic or on-street parking problems in adjacent areas and
neighborhoods.

plazas and other pedestrian circulation areas.
8) Size of Plants: Required trees shall be at least fifteen (15) gallon size tree.
Shrubs shall be minimum 1 gallon size.
d. Building Landscape Exceptions:
1) Loading and Service Areas: Landscaping is not required along exterior walls at
loading and service areas not visible from the street or adjacent parking areas.
Supplemental landscape screening may be required between a loading or
service area directly opening to the street or adjacent properties so as to
mitigate the view of such activity.
2) Building elevations not visible from public view. Landscaping is not required
along exterior walls not visible from the street or adjacent properties.
100-3
3) Landscape at Pick-Up Window: Landscaping is not required at the pick up
window. If a landscape area is provided along the exterior wall adjacent to a
drive-through lane, the planting area shall be at least two (2) feet wide.
4) Outdoor Storage Areas: No landscaping is required for the interior perimeter of
outdoor storage areas that are screened from public view.
5) Mini-Storage Facilities: Exterior areas at public entrances for mini-storage
facilities, driveway entrances and street frontage adjacent to such facilities shall
require landscaping as per this ordinance. No landscaping shall be required
where the exterior wall of a mini-storage structure is located on an interior
property line or for the interior building layout, unless required as a condition
of approval.
F. LANDSCAPE WATER CONSERVATION
1. Xeriscape landscaping. Landscape plans shall incorporate xeriscape principles to the
greatest extent possible so as to achieve the best results for water conservation goals.
Xeriscape refers to a landscaping technique that includes the use of drought-tolerant,
low water use plants and supporting management practices.
2. Rainwater harvesting can be incorporated into landscape design plans to allow the
capture, diversion, and storage of water for plant irrigation and other uses through such
techniques as contouring of the landscape with swales and catchment basins to direct
the flow of gravity-fed runoff in an advantageous manner.
3. Edible fruit and nut trees proposed with required landscape plans may be considered
where served by alternative water conservation sources, such as reclaimed water
systems and/or rainwater harvesting techniques.
100- 4
G. ADDITIONAL LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
1. Open space. Open space shall be identified as an integral part of a development. Open
space shall include both developed areas and natural undisturbed areas.
2. Landscape buffering. As per the standards set forth in this Ordinance, landscape
buffering is required between non-residential uses and residential uses, and between
multi-family residential and single family uses. Landscape buffering may include trees
and shrubs, solid masonry walls, grade changes and/or berms, or a combination of
design components.
3. Maintenance and Replacement:
a. The property owner, tenant or lessee shall maintain or cause to be maintained all
landscape materials and landscaped areas in accordance with the approved
landscape plan. Maintenance shall include regular irrigation, weeding, fertilizing
and pruning, as necessary to ensure the survival of plant material.
b. The Community Development Director, or designee, shall provide the property
owner and/or the tenant or lessee written notice of dead or missing landscape
material in violation of landscaping requirements, and they shall allow at least
ninety (90) days time to provide for the replacement of such materials.
4. Backflow Prevention Device Screening Requirements.
a. Purpose: The standards in this section provide a method to screen backflow prevention
devices from public view in a manner that integrates with the overall design of a
development.
b. Applicability: These guidelines shall apply to all such assemblies and equipment
installed within the City of Cottonwood.
c. Design Standards: The location of the water line and backflow assembly shall be
approved by the Utilities Department as early as possible in the design process so as to
coordinate the screening requirements with the assembly location. It shall be located in a
manner that minimizes visibility from public view while providing all necessary access
for safety and maintenance, as per the following:
1) All backflow prevention devices two (2) inches in size or less shall be covered
by a wire mesh basket-type cover. The basket and assembly shall be painted a
similar color, which shall be compatible with the building design or landscape
features.
2) All backflow prevention devices greater than two (2) inches in size shall be screened
from view from adjacent streets by a combination of a low masonry wall and
landscaping. The screening wall shall be comprised of decorative block, stone,
stucco or other masonry material that is 36 inches to 40 inches in height above
grade and at least six (6) feet in length along one side screening the assembly.
100-5
3) Masonry screening walls shall be constructed with materials, colors and design
details that compliment the overall development theme, including building
architecture, site features or landscaping.
4) Where landscaping is included with required screening features for larger
assemblies, there shall be a minimum of two (2) shrubs that are each five (5) gallon
size or larger when planted.
5) Insulating bags used to cover the assembly shall have a similar or compatible
color with the surrounding development. If a device is screened by a wire mesh
basket and includes an insulating bag underneath, both need to be the same or
similar color and the color needs to be compatible with the surrounding
development.
d. Backflow Device Screening Options: Options to the masonry screening wall for the
backflow prevention device may be considered through the Design Review process
subject to one or more of the following conditions:
1) A freestanding monument sign with an architecturally integrated base may be
considered in place of a masonry wall as screening for the backflow prevention
device.
2) Rocks, boulders or similar natural materials used as landscape elements.
3) Portions of buildings and architectural features that project into the landscape in
an integrated manner.
4) Utility cabinets, trash enclosures and similar utility features that may be located
within the landscape area, provided such features include integrated
landscaping materials and design features.

H. COTTONWOOD AREA LANDSCAPE PLANT LIST
1. Purpose and Intent: The Cottonwood Area Plant List provides recommended plants for
Cottonwood, Arizona. The list includes both native and adaptive plants that are
appropriate for landscaping in the area of Cottonwood. Native plants are indigenous to
this area and are the best suited to the climate and location. Other non-native, low
water use plants that may be suitable for this climate and environment are said to be
adaptive.
2. Plant Communities: The Cottonwood Area Plant List is organized according to plant
communities, which are defined as associations of plants within a common
environment that interact with each other in an interdependent manner. For
Cottonwood, there are two dominant plant communities, which are identified as the
following:
a. Upper Sonoran Chaparral. The dry hillsides and rocky slopes between the river
corridor and the mountain foothills are characterized by a chaparral-type plant
community.
b. Riparian. The Verde River corridor and intersecting side washes include a number
of trees and plants that are specifically adapted to the river and wash drainage
environments and are generally not recommended for use outside of those areas due
to higher water requirements. A number of plants grow naturally in both the
riparian and chaparral areas, so there is more flexibility with plant choices in the
riparian and wash areas.
3. Modification of the Plant List for Cottonwood: For approved landscape plans,
proposals to modify the plant list may be submitted to the Community Development
Director for administrative approval where such plants meet the criteria for appropriate
low-water use landscaping. For development applications requiring approval by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, proposals to modify the plant list may be submitted
with the application. The Commission shall have the authority to approve or deny
modifications to the Plant List where such plants are deemed as appropriate based on
the criteria as described in this ordinance.
100-7
4. Prohibited Plants: The following plants shall not be approved for use with required
landscape plans due to their tendencies as high water use plants, invasive species
and/or high-pollen producing characteristics. Plants with these characteristics should
generally be avoided for landscape plantings in the Cottonwood area.
a. Common Bermuda Grass (Cynodon dactylon). Invasive weed grass.
b. Desert Broom (Baccharis sarothroides). Invasive weed plant.
c. Red Brome (Bromus rubens). Non-native invasive winter grass.
d. Fountain Grass (Pennisetum setaceum). Self-seeding perennial bunchgrass.
e. Mulberry Tree (Male) (Morus, male var.) Noxious pollen producers.
f. Oleander (Nerium oleander) Large invasive and toxic shrub.
g. Olive Tree (Olea europaea) Allergy-producing pollen. Swan Hill, Wilson Hill
and similar non-flowering varieties that produce no pollen may be considered.
h. Russian Olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) Non-native invasive tree.
i. Pampas Grass (Cortaderia selloana). Invasive clump grass.
j. Paradise Tree (Ailanthus altissima). Also known as Tree-of-Heaven, non-native,
highly invasive weed tree.
k. Giant Reed (Arundo donax). Large, fast-growing invasive non-native grass.
l. Russian Thistle (Salsola tragus & Salsola iberica). Small highly invasive shrub,
also known as Common Tumbleweed.
m. Tamarisk (Tamarix chinensi) Aggressive invasive tree or large shrub, also know as
Saltcedar.

SECTION 408. OUTDOOR LIGHTING CODE
A. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
A.R.S., Title 49, Chapter 7, Light Pollution, § 49-1101 et seq., is hereby incorporated by
reference.
B. MISSION STATEMENT
To afford every citizen of Cottonwood the flexibility to engage in the pursuit of safe,
inexpensive lighting practices for the purpose of commerce and private use without being
impeded upon or impeding upon other citizens desiring a more pristine night time
environment free from light pollution, waste, trespass, or clutter while providing nighttime
safety, security and productivity.
C. PURPOSE AND INTENT
1. The use of outdoor lighting is often necessary for adequate nighttime safety and utility,
but common lighting practices can also interfere with other legitimate public concerns.
Principle among these concerns are 1) the degradation of the nighttime visual
environment by production of unsightly and dangerous glare, 2) unnecessary waste of
energy and resources in the production of too much light or wasted light, 3)
interference in the use or enjoyment of property which is not intended to be illuminated
at night, and 4) the loss of the often-neglected scenic view of the heavens due to
increased urban skyglow. It is hereby recognized that these different interests, those of
safety and utility and those of aesthetic appearance, need not compete. Good modern
lighting practices can provide adequate light for safety and utility without excessive
glare or light pollution. In nearly all cases, careful attention to questions of when and
where and how much nighttime lighting is needed, will lead to better lighting practice
from all viewpoints.
2. It is also recognized that the topography and atmospheric conditions in northern
Arizona are uniquely suited for government, military, commercial, and private
astronomical observation in the area, and that unnecessary or excessive uses of outdoor
nighttime lighting have an adverse impact on astronomical observation, even at
relatively distant observatories.
3. Accordingly, it is the intent of this Code to encourage lighting practices and systems
which will minimize light pollution, glare, light trespass, and conserve energy while
maintaining nighttime safety, utility, security and productivity.
D. CONFLICTING REGULATIONS
In the event of conflict between the regulations set forth in this Code and any other
regulations applicable to the same area, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall
govern.
102
E. APPROVED MATERIALS AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION OR
INSTALLATION/OPERATION
1. The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the use of any design, material
or method of installation or operation not specifically prescribed by this Code,
provided any such alternate has been approved by the Development Review Board.

not limited to architectural illumination, flag monument lighting, and illumination of
trees, bushes, etc.
5. Community Development Director means the Director of Community Development for
the City of Cottonwood or his or her designated representative.
6. Development Project means any residential, commercial, industrial or mixed use
subdivision plan or individual building development or remodeling plan which is
submitted to the City for approval.
7. Direct Illumination means illumination resulting from light emitted directly from a
lamp, luminary or reflector, not light diffused through translucent signs or reflected
from other surfaces such as the ground or building faces.
8. Fully Shielded Fixture means that fixtures are shielded in such a manner that light rays
emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture, are
projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the fixture
103
where light is emitted.
9. Installed means attached, or fixed in place, whether or not connected to a power
source.
10. Light Trespass is spill light falling over property lines that illuminates adjacent grounds
or buildings in an objectionable manner.
11. Lumen is the unit used to measure the actual amount of visible light, which is produced
by a lamp as defined by the manufacturer.
12. Luminary means the complete lighting assembly, less the support assembly.
13. Multi-class Lighting means any outdoor lighting used for more than one purpose, such
as security and decoration, when those purposes fall under the definitions for two or
more lighting classes as defined for Class 1, 2 and 3 Lighting above.
14. Motion Sensing Security Lighting means a fixture designed, and properly adjusted, to
illuminate an area around a residence or other building by means of switching on a
lamp when motion is detected inside the area or perimeter, and switching the lamp off
when the detected motion ceases.
15. Neon Lighting means lighting using luminous gas filled tubes often formed into text,
symbols or decorative elements. Neon Lighting includes tubes with typical diameters
of 10 to 20 millimeters filled with neon, argon, xenon, or other gasses and producing
various colors of light. Not included are replaceable T-8 (1 inch diameter) and T-12
(1.5 inch diameter) or PL (compact) fluorescent tubes.
16. Net Acreage means the remaining ground area of a parcel after deleting all portions for
proposed and existing public rights-of-way and undeveloped area.
17. Outdoor Light Fixtures means all outdoor illuminating devices, reflective surfaces,

well as a natural person.
20. Security Lighting is lighting designed to illuminate a property or grounds for the
purpose of visual security. This includes fully shielded lighting designed to be left on
during night time hours as well as motion sensing lighting fixtures.
21. Temporary Lighting means lighting which does not conform to the provisions of this
Code and which will not be used for more than one thirty (30) day period within a
calendar year. Temporary lighting is intended for uses which by their nature are of
limited duration; e.g. holiday decorations, civic events, or construction projects.
22. Total Outdoor Light Output means the maximum total amount of light, measured in
lumens, from all outdoor light fixtures on a property. For lamp types that vary in their
output as they age (such as high pressure sodium and metal halide), the initial output,
as defined by the manufacturer, is the value to be considered.
23. Unshielded Fixture means a fixture that allows light to be emitted above the horizontal
directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture or a reflector.
24. Watt is the unit used to measure the electrical power consumption (not the light output)
of a lamp.
G. PREFERRED SOURCE
Due to their high energy efficiency, long life and spectral characteristics, low-pressure
sodium (LPS) lamps are the preferred illumination source throughout the city. Their use is
encouraged for outdoor illumination whenever possible.
H. LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS
1. Outdoor floodlighting by flood light projection above the horizontal is prohibited
except for lamps specifically exempted under sections H.11 and H.18 and properly
adjusted motion sensing security lighting fixtures as defined in subsection F.14.
2. All light fixtures which are required to be shielded shall be installed in such a manner
that the shielding complies with the definition of fully shielded fixtures.
105
3. All light fixtures, including security lighting, except street lamps, shall be aimed or
shielded so that the direct illumination shall be confined to the property boundaries of
the source. Particular care is to be taken to assure that the direct illumination does not
fall onto or across any public or private street or road. Motion sensing lighting fixtures
shall be properly adjusted, according to the manufacturers instructions, to turn off
when detected motion ceases.
4. No new mercury vapor light fixtures nor replacement equipment other than bulbs shall
be sold or installed for use as outdoor lighting within the City of Cottonwood after the
effective date of this Code, and the use of mercury vapor light fixtures for outdoor
lighting is prohibited after January 1, 2005.
5. Search lights, laser source lights, strobe or flashing lights, motion or illusion lights or
any similar high-intensity light shall not be permitted, except in emergencies by police
and fire personnel at their direction or as permitted in subsection K-1.
6. Class 1 lighting, including but not limited to, sales, service, commercial, assembly,
repair, maintenance, and industrial areas, may only continue in operation until 10:00
p.m., or for as long as the area is in active use. This provision is not applicable to
fixtures lawfully installed or implemented prior to the adoption of the Code.
7. Class 2 lighting shall have no time restrictions except as specified by the Development
Review Board for new projects.
8. Class 3 lighting, except for flag pole lighting, must be extinguished after 10:00 p.m. or
when the business closes, whichever is later, except that low-wattage holiday
decorations may remain on all night from November 15 to January 15.
9. Multi-class lighting, except for security lights, must conform to the time limitations of
the most strict class.

excluding streetlights used for illumination of public rights-of-way, of any
development project shall not exceed 100,000 lumens per net acre, averaged over the
entire property. No more than 5,500 lumens per net acre may be accounted for by
lamps in unshielded fixtures permitted in subsection H.18.
11. Lighting, in all cases, for all outdoor athletic fields, courts, tracks or ranges shall be
considered Class 1 (Color Rendition). Lighting allowed in this subsection shall be
subject to approval of the Development Review Board. When the proposed lumens per
acre exceeds the limits of subsection H.10, the installation shall be designed to achieve
no greater than the minimum illuminance levels for the activity as recommended by the
Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). The installation shall
also limit off-site spill (off the parcel containing the sports facility) to a maximum of
0.5 fc at any location on any non-residential property, and 0.05 fc at any location on
any residential property, as measurable from any orientation of the measuring device.
Every such lighting system design shall be certified by an Arizona registered engineer
as conforming to all applicable restrictions of this Code.
106
All events shall be scheduled so as to complete all activity by 10:00 p.m. Illumination
of the playing field, court, track or range shall be permitted after 10:00 p.m. only to
conclude a scheduled event that was unable to conclude before 10:00 p.m. due to
unusual circumstances. Fully shielded lighting shall be required for fields designed for
amateur, recreational or non-professional sports activity. For professional level sports
facilities where fully shielded fixtures are not utilized, acceptable luminaries shall
include those which:
a. Are provided with internal or external glare control louvers, or both, and installed
so as to minimize uplight and offsite light trespass as required in subsection F.10
above, and;
b. Are installed and maintained with aiming angles that permit no greater than two
percent (2%) of the light emitted by each fixture to project above the horizontal.
12. Lighting for Outdoor Display Lots shall be considered Class 1 (Color Rendition), and
shall conform to the lumens per acre limits of subsection H.10 except as follows:
a. All such lighting shall utilize fully shielded luminaries that are installed in a fashion
that maintains the fully-shielded characteristics. When the proposed lumens per
acre exceed the limits of subsection H.10 the installation shall be designed to
achieve no greater than the minimum illuminance levels for the activity as
recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA).
The installation shall also limit off-site spill (off the parcel containing the display

considered where superior design quality is provided resulting in a more
innovative, creative project. Provide a detailed summary of proposed development
standards for the project, including the following:
(1) Minimum lot sizes, building setbacks, minimum yard standards, maximum
height, maximum lot coverage and similar standards, as applicable.
(2) Describe proposed standards for parking, lighting, signage, and landscaping.
(3) Unique development standards, such as buffering and screening between uses,
project entry features, or other requirements related to the physical
development of the project.
g. Design Guidelines. The design guidelines section of the MDP shall describe both
the overall development theme and specific design details for buildings and
structures, site walls, signage, lighting, landscape features, paving, and similar
project elements. It is the intent of the PAD standards that each project will be
developed with an integrated design theme that defines the character of the
development. The applicant shall develop and provide proposed design guidelines
for the project to include the following:
(1) General Guidelines:
a) Describe the architectural theme for the development and provide graphic
examples where necessary to illustrate how the design theme applies to
various elements of the development.
165
b) Provide design details for buildings, site features, site walls, signage,
lighting, landscaping, pavement and other project elements.
c) For large-scale residential development, provide a variety of housing types
(single-family, apartments, and townhouses), housing densities (lot width,
depth and size), and home design (different floor plans, elevations and
orientation). Residential planned development shall be encouraged to
include a variety of housing types and designs; however, the actual project
size where variety needs to be incorporated shall be evaluated based on the
General Plan designation, existing conditions, surrounding context and
other unique conditions.
d) Garage doors and carport openings need to be located at the same distance
or farther back from the street frontage than the primary dwelling so as to
avoid a neighborhood street environment dominated by garage doors or
parking structures.
e) Provide graphic exhibits, as necessary, to describe specific details related
to the design guidelines, including building design, paving, landscaping,
site walls, sign structures, lighting or similar features.
(2) Site Features:
a) Provide details for project entry features, including decorative walls,
landscaping, project identification signage and other design elements.
b) Provide details for perimeter site walls. Walls should be appropriately
detailed to enhance the quality and character of the project. Incorporate
treatments such as stucco finish, textured block, brick, decorative cap
block, combination block/wrought iron, and integration with adjacent
landscaping. Wrought iron, view-type fences should be utilized adjacent to
retention basins, open space, and recreational amenities. Chain link fences
and standard block walls shall be avoided where visible from streets or
surrounding properties.
c) Design outdoor lighting to address safety and utility, as well as to enhance
the character of the buildings, landscaping and site features.
(3) Building Design:
a) Provide a summary of the proposed materials and colors for the
development. Describe exterior materials and colors of building
components, including walls, windows, doors, and roofs. Reproductions
of color samples may be included in the MDP for reference with a separate
set of manufacturers material and color samples provided for public
hearing review.
b) Although it is the intent of this ordinance to encourage a coordinated
design theme for the PAD, variety in the design of individual buildings
166
and residences is strongly encouraged, including variety in building
massing elements, roofing materials and exterior details.
(4) Streetscape Design
a) Provide graphic details and descriptions of streetscape design for various
types of streets, including local residential streets, commercial or mixed
use streets, parkways and connector streets. Indicate pavement details,
landscaping, site walls and unique signage to be incorporated in the typical
streetscape design.
b) Provide details of street landscaping, including proposed tree varieties.
The landscaping shall be designed to enhance the aesthetic quality of the
development and to integrate with the surrounding natural environment.
(5) Neighborhood Design
a) Indicate how the plan provides a coherent system of neighborhood
elements, including interconnected residential blocks, orientation of homes
to the street, open space and parks, and safe, convenient and
interconnected pedestrian connections.
b) Provide adequate buffering and/or screening from less compatible
neighborhood elements, such as arterial and collector streets, and adjacent
non-residential uses.
h. Circulation Standards.
(1) The arrangement, character, extent, grade, width, and location of all
roadways, streets, bike paths, or trails shall conform to applicable City
standards, unless adjusted for specific topographical or developmental
conditions in accordance with an approved traffic engineering study.
(2) The need to conduct a Traffic Impact Study shall be based on the land use
and size of the development. Residential development with 50 dwelling units
or more in total and/or commercial development with 100,000 square feet in
gross floor area or greater and/or industrial development with 200,000 square
feet in gross floor area or greater, including all development approved for
phased development, shall be subject to the requirements for conducting a
Traffic Impact Study.
(3) The City Engineer shall review the Traffic Impact Study based on the
following conditions:
a) Existing traffic problems or congestion;
b) Public concerns regarding the development;
c) Negative impacts on adjacent developments;
167
d) The circulation conditions propose a deviation from City of Cottonwood
standards; or
e) Other local issues that may be present.
(4) Where the need for a Traffic Impact Study has been identified, this study
should be completed and submitted to the City Engineer for review prior to
the Planning and Zoning Commission hearing. The developer should
estimate the numbers of trips generated by the development and confirm the
Category of the study with the City Engineer before submitting the report.
Traffic Impact Studies for the City of Cottonwood are classified into three
categories:
a) Category I - Developments that generate between 100 and 300 vehicle
trips during any peak hour.
b) Category II - Developments that generate between 300 and 750 vehicle
trips during any peak hour.
c) Category III - Developments that generate more than 750 vehicle trips
during any peak hour.
(5) Where such is not shown on the General Plan, adopted transportation plan,
specific area plan or preliminary plans, the arrangement of streets, bicycle
facilities and trails shall provide continuation or appropriate projection of
existing streets, bicycle facilities and trails in surrounding areas. Streets,
bicycle facilities and trails shall be designed to make the best use of the land
features and open space requirements of this Ordinance, in addition to
meeting public safety issues.
(6) Planned development shall provide for adequate traffic circulation that
incorporates the adopted City street functional classification system to
handle the projected traffic volumes on the streets.
(7) Individual home lots should not front onto collector or arterial streets.
Options include orienting the rear of lots to such streets, side orientation at
local street intersections, and the creative use of open space, retention areas
and screening techniques between the street and the rear of properties.
(8) Neighborhood streets should be designed to enhance neighborhood integrity
and safety, encourage pedestrian activity, and provide logical connections to
major activity centers (e.g. parks, schools, recreation facilities). The local
street pattern should emphasize traffic calming techniques with short loops,
cul-de-sacs, and gently curving streets.
(9) Streets and street systems within the proposed development need to be
designed to provide interconnection with surrounding development and
neighborhood streets. Linear streets that encourage cut-through traffic should
be avoided unless they are specifically identified in the General Plan as
collector or arterial streets.
168
(10) The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from lot line to lot line, shall
be as established in the MDP based on City standards. Proposed streets shall
extend or project existing streets at their same or greater width, but not at a
width less than prescribed by established standards, unless it can be
demonstrated that a narrower street will serve the function of efficient site
planning and convenience for the residents/occupants and still satisfy public
safety issues.
(11) Access to development fronting on state highways must be in compliance
with ADOT standards, including the established access management plans
for those routes. Documentation must be provided from ADOT to ensure
compliance with standards and requirements.
(12) Traffic calming techniques shall be incorporated in the street layout for
planned area developments where such calming of traffic is deemed
desirable for supporting neighborhood values and improved quality of life.
Effective traffic calming programs combine physical design concepts in the
engineering of the street environment with traffic management programs that
alter driver behavior, so as to reduce neighborhood traffic speeds and/or cutthrough
volumes in the interest of improving street safety and general
neighborhood values. Traffic calming techniques shall include the following:
a) The incorporation of traffic calming techniques shall be based on
carefully considered engineering principles for the design, placement and
spacing of such features, as described in standards and guidelines
produced by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Institute
for Transportation Engineers (ITE), or similarly recognized professional
standards; and
b) Traffic calming techniques shall include features such as intersection
chokers, mid-block swellings, short block design, roadway deflections
referred to as chicanes, traffic islands, center island refuges, textured
pavement, speed tables, roundabouts, mini-circles and similar measures.
i. Open Space Standards.
(1) Open space shall be designed as an integral part of the development. The
designation of open space includes both undisturbed natural areas and
developed landscape components. Open space should be designated to
provide interconnection and continuity between undeveloped areas to the
greatest extent possible so as to address the health of the environment, habitat
protection and natural process. Additional objectives to be addressed by open
space shall include buffering, screening, transition and similar design-based
objectives.
(2) Open space shall not be less than 30 percent of the gross acreage, of the
parcels within the PAD proposed for residential and mixed-use development,
excluding public and private road rights-of-way; and not less than 10 percent
of the gross acreage of the parcels within the PAD proposed for commercial or
168-1
industrial development, excluding public and private road rights-of-way,
unless off-setting community benefits are demonstrated and approved in the
MDP. Specific parcel allocations of open space may be required as part of the
30 percent and 10 percent overall requirements.
(3) Additional area for open space may be required as a condition of approval for
PAD Zoning based on the need for additional buffering between uses or the
need to address preservation of unique natural aspects of the site, including
washes, hillsides and other features identified as significant. Specific
standards for open space shall be as per Section 407, Landscape Requirements
of this ordinance.
(4) Open space shall be conceptually depicted on the MDP as:
a) Dedicated municipal use, public parks, and school sites;
b) Bike paths, equestrian, and/ or hiking trails;
c) Public or private park and recreation areas;
d) Floodway and floodplain areas designated as undeveloped areas;
e) Retention basins required to comply with the one-hundred (100) year
storm, per Ordinance number 172, shall be counted as open space when
improved or landscaped to be a cohesive and integral element of the
overall landscape plan;
f) Landscape yards that are adjacent to streets or common areas and that are
designed as commonly-maintained and interconnected areas;
g) Development site enhancements, including landscapes and hardscaped
areas, plazas, and courtyards; and
h) Existing natural areas, including washes, drainage courses, riparian areas,
hillsides, ridge lines, and other natural open space areas.
(5) Required open space area shall not include any of the following:
a) Dedicated streets, alleys and other public rights-of-way, except that all
landscaping within rights-of-way shall be included;
b) Vehicular driveways, parking, loading, and storage areas;
c) Reservation of municipal use, public park, or school sites which the
governmental entity shall be required to purchase; only if such sites are
dedicated shall they constitute open space as defined above;
168-2
d) Concrete channels or rock lined areas designed primarily as a drainage
channel. This does not include natural washes that may include some areas
with rip rap treatment or minor rock lined features to augment erosion
control; and
e) Yards within residential areas of a PAD that are not otherwise included as
part of a commonly maintained, integrated landscape.
j. Landscape Standards. Proposed landscape standards shall be in compliance with
Section 407, Landscaping Requirements, of this ordinance. Any variation proposed
for the PAD must clearly indicate an improvement to the adopted standards. In
addition, the following is required:
(1) Provide a master plant list for the development indicating trees, shrubs,
groundcovers and other plants. Indicate proposed varieties for street trees and
parking lot trees.
(2) Describe techniques to ensure low water use landscaping will be provided,
including xeriscape landscape treatment, greywater use and rainwater
harvesting methods.
(3) In addition to a master landscape plan for the development, provide graphic
details for typical landscape installations, including development entry
features, parks or common areas, building landscaping, parking lots,
pedestrian walkways, typical streetscape and similar applications.
k. Statement of Water Use. For development that proposes to exceed the number of
dwelling units allowed by the existing zoning classification, provide a statement
comparing a likely range of water use for the proposed development in comparison
to development under the current zoning. Contact the City of Cottonwood Utilities
Department to obtain current data regarding average household water use for
Cottonwood.
l. Water Conservation Program. Dual drainage systems to accommodate gray water
use are required for certain types of residential development, as per adopted
amendments to the City of Cottonwood Plumbing Code. A Planned Area
Development (PAD) may propose alternative water conservation systems, other
than dual type plumbing systems, as part of its Master Development Plan. The City
Council may waive the dual type plumbing system requirement as part of its
approval of the PAD and/or development agreement upon finding that the project
will incorporate superior water conservation, re-use and/or recharge features,
including a reclaimed water system serving the PAD. Among the factors the City
Council will evaluate include:
(1) The greater efficiency of a master planned community-wide application of
water conservation, re-use and recharge features, demonstrating responsible
use of reclaimed water as provided for in the approved Master Development
Plan.
168-3
(2) The reclaimed water is not used for golf course irrigation, unless the course
was previously approved and vested prior to the date of adoption of this
Ordinance.

by and installed to all Federal, State, County and Municipal standards as they
apply.
m. Phasing Plan. Describe proposed phasing of the development, if any, and indicate
the phase lines on the site plan.
(1) Interconnected public streets, sidewalks, drainage features and infrastructure
may be required to be installed with the initial phase of development so as to
adequately address public safety access, coherent development and
functionality of facilities. The proposed phasing plan needs to indicate how
adequate, safe, convenient and efficient circulation and infrastructure needs
will be addressed with the phasing plan.
(2) A PAD plan may be constructed in phases and the PAD narrative shall
specify the phases of development, locations and timing of on-site and off-site
improvements for each phase, as well as, an estimated range of time for
beginning and completion of each phase.
(3) Requests for minor modifications to the phasing plan shall be subject to
approval by the Director with a right of appeal to the City Council.
(4) The applicant may enter into a development agreement with the City
providing for the timing, sizing, and funding of phased infrastructure
improvements required for the PAD or may use any alternative mechanism
acceptable to the City.
(5) Disturbed areas approved for future phased development shall include dust
free surfacing and/or temporary landscaping. Additional site treatments may
be required for future development areas located next to public streets or
adjacent to existing development.
n. Operations and Maintenance Responsibilities. Identify the ownership and
maintenance responsibilities for common areas and landscaping within rights-ofway
and identify the homeowners association, improvements district, or other
mechanism to assure long-term maintenance of common areas and rights-of-way.
(1) In the event that certain land areas or structures are provided within the PAD
for private recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of such land and
buildings shall establish an arrangement to assure a continued standard of
maintenance consistent with the conditions of PAD approval.
168-4
(2) All utility lines, except electric utility lines 69KV or larger, shall be installed
underground.
(3) Development within a PAD shall conform to all conditions and standards of
PAD approval. The PAD applies to the subject property and change in
ownership or successors in interest does not constitute a change in agreed
upon standards and requirements. Section 404 General Provisions of the City
of Cottonwood Zoning Ordinance shall apply for any general development
standards not specifically a part of the PAD approval.
o. Other Information and Exhibits. Any other documents, letters, photographs, or
exhibits that provide information regarding the proposed PAD may be included
with the MDP.
p. Citizen Review and Participation. Section 301. B. of the Zoning Ordinance
regarding Amendments or Zone Changes includes public notification and citizen
participation requirements that must be addressed prior to any public hearing on the
matter. This includes conducting neighborhood meeting/s, posting public notice on

two parts.
Subdivision also includes any condominium, cooperative, community
apartment, townhouse or similar project containing four or more parcels, in
which an undivided interest in the land is coupled with the right of exclusive
occupancy of any unit located thereon, except that plats of such projects need

the property shown on the plat are to be divided.
B. Subdivision does not include the following:
1) The sale or exchange of parcels of land to or between adjoining property
owners if such sale or exchange does not create additional lots.
2) The partitioning of land in accordance with other statutes regulating the
partitioning of land held in common ownership.

building or manufactured home park, nor to mineral, oil or gas leases.

B. That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public safety,
health and welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said
property is situated, and

the developer. If compliance is re-established, processing of the plat or construction of
associated improvements may proceed from the date of compliance as authorized by the
Community Development Director.

regulations shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall
be punished by fine and/or imprisonment. Each day that a violation is permitted to
exist shall constitute a separate offense.

and punishment of any person hereunder shall not relieve such person from the
responsibility to correct or remove prohibited conditions. In addition to the other

shall approve said plat; and the Mayor shall so certify this action by signature on the
Final Plat.
A. Conditions of Approval
1. The Council may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure

be submitted following Council approval before the subdivision is recorded:
A. Fee: The fee for recording the Final Plat and accompanying deed restrictions
and any ratification or pertinent documents will be required once the Final Plat
is approved by the City Council and the subdivider has addressed the
stipulations of approval and the plat is ready for recording. If the recording fee is
submitted in the form of a check, it must be made payable to the Yavapai County
Recorder.
B. ADRE Questionnaire: A copy of the developers Subdivision Questionnaire to

not been satisfied and the plat is not presented or found acceptable for recording the
Final Plat shall be referred back to the City Council for action, including possible
revocation of approval.
411.00 Amendments
411.01 Subdivision plat proposals may be amended during the course of plat review. The
process for amendment depends on whether the change is determined to be major or
minor in scope, and at what interval the change is being proposed (Preliminary Plat,
Final Plat, or Recordation). A determination will be made by the Community
Development Director upon receipt of comments from reviewing City departments
whether the changes are "minor authorized" changes and the Final Plat may be
presented to the City Council or if the change is material and a "revised" Preliminary Plat
will be required for consideration by the Planning & Zoning Commission and City
Council. Minor authorized changes may include adjustment, variation, and reduction of
lots, lot lines, easements or statements contained in the Preliminary Plat if they are
found by the Community Development Director to be consistent with the intent and
design of the approved Preliminary Plat. Adding lots, streets or creating exceptions to
the Citys design standards are changes which will require a "revised" Preliminary Plat.
A. Amendments between Preliminary Plat and before Final Plat: Any minor
amendment proposed following Commission approval of the Preliminary Plat will
be highlighted for consideration by the City Council as part of the Final Plat
application. Major amendments to the Preliminary Plat will be returned to the
Commission for further consideration.

Community Development Director may administratively approve any minor
amendment (i.e., change of street names, decrease in the number of lots,
nominal increases or decreases of lot sizes; nominal changes in the location of
streets, easements, ands other public rights-of-way), to a Final Plat which has
already been approved by the City Council. Any major amendment to a Final Plat
which follows Council approval will be referred to the City Council.
C. Amendments which follow recording: Any plat of a subdivision that has been
filed for record may be amended to correct an error in any course or distance or
other necessary item that was omitted therefrom, or to correct a drafting,
graphic, technical, or similar type error, determined to be minor in scope by
either the Community Development Director or a representative Committee
delegated to evaluate such amendment proposals (scribners error), and
subsequently recorded in the office of the County Recorder.
1. The Community Development Director may administratively approve any
minor amendment (i.e., change of street names, decrease in the number of
lots, nominal increases or decreases of lot sizes, nominal changes in the
location of streets, easements and other public rights-of-way). The
Community Development Director shall examine such amended plat, and if
such examination discloses that the only changes on the amended plat are
changes authorized above, he shall certify this to be a fact over his signature
on the amended plat. Thereafter, the amended plat shall be entitled to be
recorded in the office of the Recorder in which the original subdivision plat
was recorded.
2. For any change in a recorded subdivision plat which exceeds the criteria
noted above, such change shall be approved by the City Council.

proposed to be abandoned or reverted to acreage. Applications for the disposition of a
public road within the City must be filed with the City Engineer. The application fee
shall be paid by the applicant at the time of filing.
412.03 Upon receipt of said application, the Community Development Director shall conduct an
investigation and shall distribute the request to reviewing agencies for comment
including but not limited to the City Public Works Department, County Assessor, local
fire district, emergency service agencies and municipalities within three (3) miles of the
subdivision, County Treasurer or other agencies as deemed appropriate by the Director.
Upon receipt of the reviewing agency comment(s), if any, the Director shall prepare a
report for presentation to the Commission for consideration of a recommendation to the
City Council at a duly noticed public hearing. Such application may necessitate
consideration for rezoning if the Commission deems it necessary or desirable.

shall conduct a duly noticed public hearing. Upon completion of said hearing, the
Commission shall recommend that the City Council approve, approve in modified form,
or deny said application as well as indicate whether or not zoning changes should

correlation with the General Plan.
B. That said abandonment would not prohibit or unduly inhibit access by the public-atlarge,
nearby property owners and public utilities with proposed development in
adjacent areas.

conveyance and submit them to the Community Development Director for recording.
The abandonment shall be effective when recorded along with an abandonment
resolution in compliance with Arizona Revised Statutes.
412.07 Whenever an abandonment is approved for publicly owned rights-of-way, the rights-ofway
shall vest in the abutting property. Zoning for abandoned rights-of-way shall be the
same as the properties to which they are conveyed. Rights-of-way or easements of
existing sewer, gas, water or similar pipelines and appurtenances and for canals, laterals
or ditches and appurtenances, and for electric, telephone, and similar lines and
appurtenances shall continue as they existed prior to the abandonment.

Appendix
Neighborhood Design Policies
It is the intent of this ordinance to promote the comprehensive planning and development of
neighborhoods which function as safe and healthy places for human habitation. Specific
neighborhood design principles have been identified as a means to promote more interactive
residential environments which place the needs of its human residents at a higher level than the
needs of the automobile. Attention to safety, security, aesthetics and pedestrian amenities are
highly valued as well as the needs of bicycle and automotive traffic. Developers are encouraged to
address the following elements in the physical design of neighborhoods:
Residential Lots
Residential structures should be placed close to the street at common setbacks to encourage greater
opportunity for neighborhood interaction and eyes on the street. Functional front porches are
encouraged in residential design. It is encouraged that front porches be placed within 15 feet of the
sidewalk, at an elevation which is also at least 30 inches above the sidewalk. Views should be
directed toward the front and rear yards to enable closer placement of homes without reducing
privacy. Physical definition should be provided between public and private lands by fences, hedges
or garden walls. Public areas should be easily observable. Private yards, balconies and other
spaces should be configured so as not to conflict with neighboring private spaces. Private open
spaces should be protected by building placement and configuration. Vehicle storage, garbage and
mechanical equipment should be positioned away from the street. Garages should be accessed from
an alley. Where garages must be front loaded, the front side should be at least 20 feet behind the
front plane of the house.
Streets, Alleys and Easements
Alleys are encouraged as a means to reduce traffic on local streets and increase opportunities for
emergency access and individual lot access drives; and to relieve local streets of unnecessary traffic,
driveways, garage doors, utility placement and trash removal. Tree lined streets and shaded
sidewalks are encouraged, together with traffic calming methods such as short block lengths (less
than 400 feet) and minimal turning radii. Hammerhead dead-ends are favored over cul-de-sacs.
Blocks
The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to provisions for
adequate building sites, solar access and orientation, the zoning requirements as to lot area and
dimensions, limitations, and opportunities of topography and associated needs for convenient
access, traffic circulation, control and safety to streets and pedestrian traffic. Blocks should not be
more than 1,320 feet in length except as the Commission considers necessary to secure efficient use
of the land or as a desired feature of street design. Where fronting on major streets, lengthened
blocks may be utilized in order to reduce the number of intersections along the major street or
arterial. Where possible, blocks should be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots. Double frontage
lots should be avoided in residential subdivisions.
Solar Orientation, Passive Heating and Cooling
It is the intent of this ordinance to encourage development and architecture which responds to the
regional climate and to preserve opportunities for solar access in the layout and design of
subdivisions and structures; to promote the utilization of solar energy and other renewable energy
resources in all new and existing residential, recreational, commercial and industrial buildings.
CITY OF COTTONWOOD SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE
ADOPTED JUNE 21, 2005

Subdivision development should feature building designs which provide for passive and/or natural
heating and cooling opportunities to the extent feasible, including establishing the long axis of
building footprints within 15-45 degrees of a line running from east to west; establishment of roof
overhangs which are sufficient to block the high summer sun, but not the low winter sun from
penetrating south facing windows.
Public Open Areas
Consideration should be given to the requirements for public land and open spaces as specified in
the City of Cottonwood General Plan, Yavapai County Trails Plan, and Recreation Park & Open
Space Standards and Guidelines published by the National Recreation and Park Association (1979).
The Planning and Zoning Commission may require certain lands to be dedicated or reserved for
public purposes in conformance with these documents as specified in these regulations.
Aesthetic Considerations
The subdivider shall address General Plan objectives in the design and layout of the subdivision
which pertain to preserving natural features such as wash corridors, mature vegetation, geology,
ridges, and other land forms (see also Appendix regarding Neighborhood Design Principles). Lots
and buildings shall be oriented to take advantage of solar access, as well as any views or natural
vistas. In all subdivisions, it is urged that due regard be demonstrated for all natural features such
as trees, slopes, required watercourses, historical and archeological sites and similar community
assets which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the property and community.
Special Design Standards for Hillside Subdivisions
Subdivisions with significant slope areas should be considered as Planned Area Developments.
Allowances should be made for the reasonable and beneficial use and development of private
property within certain hillside areas while promoting the public health, safety, convenience and
general welfare of the Citizens of the City of Cottonwood. Efforts should be made to help maintain
the character, identity, and image of hillside areas (i.e., ridgelines, etc.) which are seen as valuable
scenic resources. Specific standards should be applied to any sloped area within a subdivision
which features a grade of 20% or greater (or any horizontal run of 100 feet which increases in
elevation by 20 feet or greater). In those areas, street grades should not exceed twelve (12) percent.
Street grades of twelve (12) percent should have a maximum length of six hundred (600) feet. "T"
type turning and backing areas should be substituted for circular turnarounds. "Panhandle,"
double frontage, and other unorthodox lots may be permitted so long as it can be adequately
demonstrated that no such lot will adversely affect any other lot.
