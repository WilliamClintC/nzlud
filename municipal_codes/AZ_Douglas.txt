of such property. This inference will apply to
charges brought pursuant to ARS § 13-1802.

prohibited as is the presence in any employee’s
system of a prohibited drug or drug metabolite.
The possession, sale or distribution of drugs,

C. The following definitions apply to this
section:

cannabinoids (THC).
“Reasonable suspicion” means a belief based
on specific contemporaneous, articulable

behavior, speech or body odor of an employee,
and reasonable inferences drawn from those
observations that suggest an employee is using
drugs or alcohol while on the job or is under
the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the
job.
“Reasonable suspicion” may arise from, but
is not limited to, the following:
1. Observable phenomena, such as direct
observation of drug or alcohol use and/or the
physical symptoms or manifestations of being
under the influence of a drug or alcohol;

employment which involves the use of
dangerous equipment or provision of services
directly impacting the public health and safety.

Medication. Employees taking prescription or
over-the-counter nonprescribed drugs or
medication which might interfere with the
performance of their job duties shall report the
usage of the drug or medication to their
supervisor before going on duty. Employees
taking such drugs or medication are responsible
for knowing any side effects of the medication
which might interfere with job performance
based upon the prescribing physician’s advice
or the warning on the medication label.
E. Applicants and Employees Subject to
Testing.
1. Pre-Employment Testing for Initial
Employment. All applicants being considered
for initial paid employment by the city shall be
required to submit to, and successfully pass, a
drug and alcohol screen urinalysis after a
conditional offer of employment is made by the
city. The offer of employment shall be
contingent upon a negative drug screening and
an alcohol level of less than 0.05.
If an applicant fails to pass the preemployment
drug and alcohol screening, the
applicant will be disqualified from
consideration for employment and shall not be
eligible to apply for employment with the city
for a period of six months from the date at the
initial, positive drug test result.
An applicant’s failure to submit to the
required pre-employment drug test shall be
considered as a request for withdrawal from
consideration for the position for which he/she
applied.
2. Reasonable Suspicion Testing. If the city
has reason to suspect that an employee is
violating this section or when there is
reasonable cause to believe an employee is
under the influence or is impaired by alcohol
and/or drugs, the city may require the employee
to submit immediately to medical tests
administered for drug or alcohol testing which
include the chemical analyses of breath, urine
and/or blood. A written record of the
observations and facts leading to the reasonable
suspicion test shall be made by the supervisor
before the test, or within twenty-four hours,
whichever is earlier. The employee shall not
engage in safety-sensitive work for eight hours
after the observation, unless the employee tests
negative for drugs and alcohol in less time. If
the test is not administered within two hours
following the observation, the supervisor shall
document the reasons for the delay. If alcohol
test is not administered within eight hours, it
will not be given. If drug test is not given
within thirty-two hours, it will not be given.
3. Post-Triggering Incident. Employees
involved in the following circumstances shall
be required to submit to a drug and/or alcohol
test:
2-54
a. Those whose use of city equipment or
vehicle results in an accident in which someone
is fatally injured;
b. Those whose use of city equipment or
vehicle results in an accident involving towaway
and/or medical assistance and who, in
addition, have received a citation from a third
party law enforcement official;
c. Those whose use of city equipment or
vehicle results in an accident under
circumstances that raise a reasonable suspicion
that the driver or operator was under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, even if no
personal or property injuries resulted, provided
that the post-accident alcohol testing must
occur within eight hours of the accident, and
post-accident drug testing must occur within
thirty-two hours of the accident.
4. Re-Employment or Re-Entry in
Workforce. Any individual who returns to
work after an absence of ninety consecutive
days or more shall be required to submit to a
drug and alcohol test prior to resuming work.
Positive results will be considered in deciding
whether the employee shall be permitted to
return to work.
5. Follow-up Testing. In the event an
employee has been offered a rehabilitation
option in lieu of discipline for a positive test
result in accordance with subsection (E)(1) of
this section, the employee shall be subject to
random drug testing for one year following the
completion of a rehabilitation program. If an
employee’s follow-up test results are positive,
no further rehabilitation will be attempted and
the employee will be subject to disciplinary
action, up to and including termination.
F. Section Violation.
1. Alcohol. An employee who tests
positive for alcohol while on city business
during the employee’s regular working hours or
while on city property during the employee’s
regular working hours shall be in violation of
this section. An alcohol test is considered
positive if the alcohol level is 0.05 or above.
2. Drugs. An employee who tests positive
for drugs shall be in violation of this section.
G. Effect of Failure to Comply with
Section. An employee who refuses to submit to
a drug or alcohol test or who violates any
aspect of this section is subject to disciplinary
action up to and including dismissal.
H. Employee and Applicant Consent
Forms. Employees and applicants who are
requested to submit to a drug test must agree in
writing to allow the results of such test to be
disclosed to and used by the city’s authorized
representatives who have a need to know, as
designated in subsection K of this section.
Failure to sign such a consent form shall be
considered a refusal to submit to testing.
I. Rehabilitation. Depending upon the
circumstances, the city may, at its option,
suspend all or part of the disciplinary action for
violation of this section in return for the
employees enrollment into a drug or alcohol
counseling or rehabilitation program for the
purpose of enabling the employee to
permanently cease the prohibited conduct. The
program must be one approved by the city.
Cost of rehabilitation or counseling shall be the
responsibility of the employee.
An employee who elects such participation
shall enter into a written agreement to that
effect. The employee may have any
disciplinary action deemed appropriate by the
city suspended while counseling and/or
rehabilitation is being utilized. An employee
who declines to participate in or fails to
complete drug rehabilitation in lieu of
disciplinary action or an employee who, having
successfully participated in such a program,
2-55
again engages in conduct prohibited by this
section shall be subject to disciplinary action
up to and including dismissal.
J. Searches. The city, through its
designated managers and supervisors, reserves
the right to search all areas and property of
which the city maintains complete control or
joint control with the employee. An employee’s
locker, closet, work area, desk, desk files,
computer files, city-owned vehicle, and similar
areas are subject to inspection for purposes of
this section.
K. Confidentiality. All investigations,
searches, and testing shall be conducted as
privately as practical. The results of drug or
alcohol screening tests shall not be included in
an applicants’ or an employee’s file but shall be
retained by the personnel office in a separate
medical file. Any conditions of employment
which may be established as a result of the
drug test (i.e. a written agreement for
rehabilitation in lieu of discipline) will become
part of the employee’s personnel file.
Except as required by state or federal law,
test results and ancillary information may be
disclosed to management personnel only on a
need-to-know basis or to any person upon the
written consent of the employee or applicant.
Information normally should be limited to the
supervisor, the city manager, the personnel
office, and legal counsel. Failure to maintain
confidentiality by any employee shall be
grounds for discipline.
L. Employee Responsibilities.
1. Pursuant to the Federal Drug-free
Workplace Act of 1988, the city prohibits the
unlawful manufacture, use, possession or
distribution of controlled substances in the
workplace. As a part of this law, employees
have the following responsibilities:
a. To abide by the terms of the city drugfree
workplace policy; and
b. To notify their supervisor or department
head of any criminal drug statute arrest for a
violation occurring in the workplace no later
than five days after such arrest;
c. To notify their supervisor or department
head of any criminal drug statute conviction no
later than five days after such conviction.
2. It is each employee’s responsibility to
immediately report to the supervisor,
department head or personnel office, any
unsafe working conditions or hazardous
activities that may jeopardize the safety of
employees. This includes the duty to
immediately report any violations of this
section. An employee who fails to report such a
violation is subject to disciplinary action up to
and including dismissal.
3. All employees will be required, as a
condition at employment, to sign a statement
that the employee has:
a. Received a copy of the city’s drug-free
workplace policy;
b. Agreed to abide by the terms of the
policy;
c. Agreed to notify the supervisor or
appropriate representative of the city within
five days, of a criminal drug statute arrest for a
violation occurring within the workplace and
for a criminal drug statute conviction.
M. Management Responsibilities.
1. Management personnel shall be
responsible for the implementation and
consistent enforcement of this section, together
with the personnel officer or designee.
Management personnel who fail to enforce this
section are subject to disciplinary action up to
and including dismissal.
2. Supervisors will be trained in the early
detection of impairment by alcohol, drugs, and
2-56
substance abuse. Supervisors must document,
in writing, the facts constituting reasonable
cause for drug and/or alcohol testing or for
violation of this section.
3. Management must inform any employee
being required to submit to drug or alcohol
testing of the requirements of this policy and
the consequences of noncompliance.
N. Drug and Alcohol Testing Methodology.
Every reasonable effort will be made to obtain
the most accurate drug or alcohol test results.
Testing procedures will include a two-tiered
testing program to ensure maximum accuracy
in the test results, observations of specimen
collection and chain-of-custody documentation.
A two-tiered procedure means that an initial
positive test will be confirmed by the use of a
gas chromatography test with mass
spectrometry (GC/MC) or an equivalent
scientifically accepted method which provides
quantitative data about the detected drug.
Following a positive screen from the initial
test and a positive screen from the confirmation
test, a portion of the specimen sufficient for
testing from a positive sample may be
transferred directly from the testing laboratory
to a laboratory of the employee’s choosing and
tested at the employee’s own expense. The
laboratory chosen by the employee must be a
laboratory approved or certified by the United
States Department of Health and Human
Services, the College of American Pathologists
or the Arizona Department of Health Services.
The employee shall initiate the transfer so that
the testing can occur within seventy-two hours
of the employee’s notification of the positive
screen.
An employee, upon request, may obtain
his/her written test results.
O. Procedures. Procedures to be followed
by management for the enforcement of this
section are available for review at the personnel
office or in department with the department
head. A description of the testing methods and
collection procedures is available for review in
the personnel office.
P. Commercial Driver’s License Holders.
Beginning on January 1, 1996, all employees
required as condition of their city employment
to have a valid commercial driver’s license
(CDL) shall comply with the United States
Department of Transportation (USDOT) and
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
rules for drug and alcohol testing of
commercial motor vehicle drivers and all
drivers with CDL’s. The USDOT and FHWA
are treating these rules as an extension of the
Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act
of 1991. The federal rules, which are set out in
49 CFR parts 40 and 382, as they may be
amended from time to time, are adopted by
reference as part of this section, with respect to
employees performing safety sensitive
functions as defined by federal regulation and
this section.
The federal rules require pre-employment,
post-accident, reasonable suspicion, random
testing and follow up testing for alcohol and
drugs through the use of breathalyzers and
urine samples. Procedures and rules for testing
of CDL holders will be available in the
Personnel Office beginning January 1, 1996.
Q. Police, Fire, and Other Employees in
Safety-Sensitive Jobs. In addition to the testing
required by this section, the police department,
fire department and other departments whose
employees perform safety sensitive jobs may,
by written policy, establish stricter testing
requirements than that set out in this policy,
including, but not limited to, nondiscriminatory
random testing, requirements for drug testing
upon promotion, requirement for testing upon
2-57
reports from a reliable informant that an
employee performing a safety sensitive job has

2.68.010 Findings and purpose.
The people of Douglas have a fundamental
interest in the development of a harmonious
and cooperative relationship between city
government and its employees. Recognition by
public employers of the right of public
employees to organize and full acceptance of
the principle and procedure of full
communication between public employers and
employee organizations can alleviate various
forms of strife and unrest. The city, its
employees and employee organizations have a
basic obligation to the public to assure the
orderly and continuous operations and
functions of government. It is the purpose of
this chapter to allow the city, public employees
and their representatives, acting within the
framework of law, to enter into discussions
with an affirmative willingness to consider
various matters relating to wages, hours, and
working conditions. It is also the purpose of
this chapter to promote the improvement of
employer/employee relations by providing a
uniform basis for recognizing the right of
public employees to join, or refrain from
joining, organizations of their own choice and
be represented, if they choose, by such
organizations in their employer/employee
relations and dealings with the city in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 598 § 1, 1992)
2.68.020 Meet and confer defined.
“Meet and confer” means the process by
which the public employer, through its chief
administrative officer or his designee, and
designees of the authorized representative will
meet at reasonable times and confer in good
faith with respect to wages, hours and other
terms and conditions of employment. This
process does not compel either party to agree to
a proposal or the making of a concession.
Notwithstanding the date an employee
representative is certified, the meet-and-confer
process shall be carried out as to all economic
items prior to the date set by law for tentative
adoption of the annual municipal budget. (Ord.
598 § 2, 1992)

and legislative body of the city. None of their
duties and obligations, as set out by the city
2-66
charter or otherwise set by law, shall be
restricted by this meet-and-confer chapter. It is
the right of the city, through its mayor and
council, to determine the purpose of each of its
constituent agencies, set standards of service to
be offered to the public, and exercise control
and discretion over its organization and
operations. It is also the right of the city to
direct its employees, take disciplinary action,
relieve its employees from duty because of lack
of work or other legitimate reasons, determine
whether goods or services shall be made,
purchased or contracted for, and determine the
methods, means and personnel by which the
city’s operations are to be conducted. The city
has the right to take all necessary action to
maintain uninterrupted service to the
community. The mayor and city council may,
at their option and sole discretion, direct the
city manager and other city representatives to
consult with the city’s employees or their
authorized representatives about the direct
consequences that decisions on those matters
may have on wages, hours and working
conditions. These rights are illustrative only
and are not to be construed as being all
inclusive. (Ord. 598 § 3, 1992)
2.68.040 Public employee rights.
Public employees shall have the right to
form, join and participate in any employee
organization or to refrain from forming, joining
or participating. Public employees shall have
the right, if they so choose, to be represented
by an employee organization of their own
choosing, to meet and confer through an
authorized employee organization with their
public employer in the determination of wages,
hours and working conditions, and to be
represented in the determination of grievances
arising thereunder. Employees may also choose
to represent themselves, or to be represented by
legal counsel in grievance matters. (Ord. 598 §
4, 1992)
2.68.050 Ineligible employees.
Unless otherwise permitted by law,
confidential, managerial and professional
employees and supervisors, judges and elected
officials shall not be represented by any
employee organization, nor shall such
employees take an active role in the
policymaking activities of an employee
organization, nor shall such employees
participate directly or indirectly in the meetand-
confer process except as representatives or
assistants to the city. (Ord. 598 § 5, 1992)

As an additional remedy, or an alternative to
a civil or criminal complaint, the city shall
compel any persons with an interest in the
property or agents of such persons to abate any
violations of this chapter. Such abatement shall

department of public works of the existence of
a public nuisance, as defined in section
8.32.030, the department of public works shall
promptly cause to be inspected the property on
which it is alleged that such public nuisance
exists. Should the city manager, upon
recommendation of the department of public
works, find that a public nuisance exists, and
that the public health, safety or welfare may be
in immediate danger, then emergency
abatement procedures shall be implemented
and the nuisance shall be removed or abated.
The building inspector shall be notified if the
public nuisance involves a building that
appears structurally unsafe. The building
inspector, upon being notified, shall cause the
building on which it is alleged such public
nuisance exists to be inspected and submit a
written report of such inspection and the
findings to the director of the department of
public works.
B. When emergency abatement is
authorized, notice to the owner, agent or
occupant of the property is not required. If
such emergency situation presents an imminent
hazard to life or public safety, the city may
immediately act to correct or abate the
emergency. Following the emergency
abatement, the department of public works
shall cause to be posted on the property liable
for the abatement a notice describing the action
taken to abate the nuisance.

correct or abate the emergency. In the event
the city is unable to contact the owner,
occupant, operator, agent or responsible party,
it in no way effects the city’s right to correct or
abate the emergency. Upon receiving notice to
abate emergency, the owner, occupant,
operator, agent or responsible party shall be
granted a hearing before the hearing officer on
the matter within seven (7) days of a written

such as to require the emergency abatement of
such nuisance, then, regular abatement
procedures shall be followed. Photographs and
reports of the findings and inspections shall be
made and filed with the director of the
department of public works.
B. The director of the department of public
works, or his designee, shall determine the
individual, firm or corporation who, from the

served on such individual, firm or corporation
by personal service or by leaving a copy of the
notice at the usual place of residence or
business of such owner, or address of such
owner shown in the recorder’s records, or by
copy mailed to such owner at such place or
address by United States certified mail return
receipt. If service of such written notice is
unable to be perfected by any of the methods
described above, the department of public
works shall cause a copy of the aforesaid notice
to be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city, once a week for two
consecutive weeks, and shall further cause a
copy of the aforesaid notice to be left with the
individual, if any, in possession of such
8 - 45 5/1/03
property on which it is alleged such public
nuisance exists, or if there is no individual in
possession thereof, the department of public
works shall cause a copy of the notice to be
posted at such structure, location or premises.
The department of public works shall also
determine from the recorder’s office who the
lienholder of the property, if any, as

notice to be served on such lienholder by

pursuant to the orders contained in the
department of public works notice, the public
nuisance shall be abated by the city at the
expense of the owner.
D. Any person who is the record owner of
the premises, location or structure at the time
an order pursuant to this chapter is issued and
served upon him, shall be responsible for
complying with that order, and liable for any
costs incurred by the city therewith,
notwithstanding the fact that he conveys his
interests in the property to another after such
order was issued and served.

the property is boarded up or otherwise
enclosed.

efforts to reach a reasonable accommodation of
the nonsmoking employee’s needs. However,
an employer is not required by this chapter to
make any expenditures or structural changes to
accommodate the preferences of nonsmoking

4. If an accommodation which is
reasonably satisfactory to all nonsmoking
employees cannot be reached in any given

employees shall prevail and the employer shall
prohibit smoking in that workplace. Where the
employer prohibits smoking in a workplace, the
area in which smoking is prohibited shall be
clearly marked with signs.
B. Notwithstanding any other provision in

written smoking policy, smoking shall be
prohibited on the entire premises.

benefits that would have accrued were it not for
the wrongful termination or discipline. The
employer shall reinstate the victim and pay the
accrued wages and benefits within ten days of
such application. Failure to comply with this
subsection is a violation of this chapter, and

2002)

12-28 10/20/05
public assembly will not substantially interrupt
the safe and orderly movement of other
pedestrian or vehicular traffic contiguous to its
route or location;
(2) The conduct of the parade or
public assembly will not require the diversion
of so great a number of City police officers to
properly police the line of movement and the
areas contiguous thereto as to prevent normal
police protection of the City;
(3) The concentration of persons,
animals, and vehicles at public assembly points
of the parade or public assembly will not
unduly interfere with proper fire and police
protection of, or ambulance service to, areas
contiguous to such public assembly areas;
(4) The conduct of the parade or
public assembly is not reasonably likely to
cause injury to persons or property;

permit application for the same time but
location is already granted or has been received
and will be granted, and the police resources
required for that prior parade or public
assembly are so great that in combination with
the subsequent proposed application, the
resulting deployment of police services would
have an immediate and adverse effect upon the
welfare and safety of persons and property; and
(12) No event is scheduled
elsewhere in the City where the police
resources required for that event are so great
that the deployment of police services for the
proposed parade or public assembly would
have an immediate and adverse effect upon the
welfare and safety of persons and property.
(b) No permit shall be granted that allows
for the erection or placement of any structure,
whether permanent or temporary, on a City
street, sidewalk, or right-of-way unless advance
approval for the erection or placement of the
structure is obtained from the City Council.

pollutant is determined to be present solely
due to sanitary wastewater discharged from
the facility provided that the sanitary
wastewater is not regulated by an
applicable categorical Standard and
otherwise includes no process wastewater.
(2) The monitoring waiver is valid only for
the duration of the effective period of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, but
in no case longer than 5 years. The User
must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each
subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See Section 2.5A(8) of.
13.04.018 of this ordinance.
(3) In making a demonstration that a
pollutant is not present, the Industrial User
must provide data from at least one
sampling of the facility’s process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at
13.04.010
13-30
the facility that is representative of all
wastewater from all processes.
(4) The request for a monitoring waiver
must be signed an authorized representative
of the User and include the certification
statement in 4.14 A.
(5) Non-detectable sample results may be
used only as a demonstration that a
pollutant is not present if the EPA
approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level
for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(6) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by
the City Manager or Director must be
included as a condition in the User’s
permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the User
in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the City Manager or
Director for 3 years after expiration of the
waiver.
(7) Upon approval of the monitoring
waiver and revision of the User’s permit by
the City Manager or Director, the Industrial
User must certify on each report with the
statement in Section 4.14 C of 13-14-401of
this ordinance, that there has been no
increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the Industrial User.
(8) In the event that a waived pollutant is
found to be present or is expected to be
present because of changes that occur in
the User’s operations, the User must
immediately: Comply with the monitoring
requirements of Section 4.4 A of 13.04.018
of this ordinance, or other more frequent
monitoring requirements imposed by the
City Manager or Director, and notify the
City Manager or Director.
(9) This provision does not supersede
certification processes and requirements
established in categorical Pretreatment
Standards, except as otherwise specified in
the categorical Pretreatment Standard.
C. All periodic compliance reports
must be signed and certified in accordance
with Section 4.14 A of 13.04.018 of this
ordinance.
D. All wastewater samples must be
representative of the User’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow
measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in
good working order at all times. The
failure of a User to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the User to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
E. If a User subject to the reporting
requirement in this section monitors any
regulated pollutant at the appropriate
sampling location more frequently than
required by the City Manager or Director,
using the procedures prescribed in Section
4.11 of 13.04.018 of this ordinance, the
results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report.
4.5 Reports of Changed Conditions
Each User must notify the City Manager or
Director of any significant changes to the
User’s operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater at least 15 days before the
change.
A. The City Manager or Director may
require the User to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate
13.04.010
13-31
the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under Section 2.5 of
13.04.018 of this ordinance.
B. The City Manager or Director may
issue an individual wastewater discharge
permit or a general permit under Section
3.6 of 13.04.018 of this ordinance or
modify an existing wastewater discharge
permit [or a general permit under Section
3.3 of 13.04.018 of this ordinance in
response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.
4.6 Reports of Potential Problems
A. In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine,
episodic nature, a noncustomary batch
discharge, a Slug Discharge or Slug Load,
that might cause potential problems for the
POTW, the User shall immediately
telephone and notify the City Manager or
Director of the incident. This notification
shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the
User.
B. Within five (5) days following such
discharge, the User shall, unless waived by
the City Manager or Director, submit a
detailed written report describing the
cause(s) of the discharge and the measures
to be taken by the User to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the User of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability which might be
incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the User of any
fines, penalties, or other liability which
may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance.
C. A notice shall be permanently
posted on the User’s bulletin board or other
prominent place advising employees who
to call in the event of a discharge described
in paragraph A, above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who could cause
such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
D. Significant Industrial Users are
required to notify the City Manager or
Director immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a Slug
Discharge.
4.7 Reports from Unpermitted Users
All Users not required to obtain an
individual wastewater discharge permit or
general permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the City Manager or Director as
the City Manager or Director may require.
4.8 Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling
and Reporting
If sampling performed by a User indicates
a violation, the User must notify the City
Manager or Director within twenty-four
(24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The User shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the City
Manager or Director within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the Industrial User is not
required if the City performs sampling at
the User’s facility at least once a month, or
if the City performs sampling at the User
between the time when the initial sampling
was conducted and the time when the User
13.04.010
13-32
or the City receives the results of this
sampling, or if the City has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial User.
4.9 Notification of the Discharge of
Hazardous Waste
A. Any User who commences the
discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of
any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR
Part 261. Such notification must include
the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If
the User discharges more than one hundred
(100) kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and
readily available to the User: an
identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of
the mass and concentration of such
constituents in the wastestream discharged
during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in
the wastestream expected to be discharged
during the following twelve (12) months.
All notifications must take place no later
than one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous
waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted
under Section 4.5 of 13.04.018 of this
ordinance. The notification requirement in
this Section does not apply to pollutants
already reported by Users subject to
categorical Pretreatment Standards under
the self-monitoring requirements of
Sections 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4 of 13.04.018 of
this ordinance.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the
requirements of paragraph A, above, during
a calendar month in which they discharge
no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40
CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge
of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of
nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar
month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR
261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months
during which the User discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste
do not require additional notification.
C. In the case of any new regulations
under section 3001 of RCRA identifying
additional characteristics of hazardous
waste or listing any additional substance as
a hazardous waste, the User must notify the
City Manager or Director, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the
effective date of such regulations.
D. In the case of any notification made
under this Section, the User shall certify
that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes
generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
13.04.010
13-33
E. This provision does not create a
right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by
this ordinance, a permit issued thereunder,
or any applicable Federal or State law.
4.10 Analytical Requirements
All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a
wastewater discharge permit application or
report shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR
Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40
CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that
the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using
validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical
procedures, including procedures suggested
by the City Manager or Director or other
parties approved by EPA.
4.11 Sample Collection
Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring
during the reporting period
A. Except as indicated in Section B
and C below, the User must collect
wastewater samples using 24-hour
flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the City Manager or
Director. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136
and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple
grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by
the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show
compliance with Instantaneous Limits.
B. Samples for oil and grease,
temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds
must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
C. For sampling required in support of
baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance
reports required in Section 4.1 and 4.3 of
13.04.018 of this ordinance [40 CFR
403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide,
total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities
for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the City
Manager or Director may authorize a lower
minimum. For the reports required by
13.04.010
13-34
paragraphs Section 4.4 of 13.04.018 of this
ordinance (40 CFR 403.12(e) and
403.12(h)), the Industrial User is required
to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance
by with applicable Pretreatment Standards
and Requirements.
4.12 Date of Receipt of Reports
Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked.
For reports, which are not mailed, postage
prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the
United States Postal Service, the date of
receipt of the report shall govern.
4.13 Recordkeeping
Users subject to the reporting requirements
of this ordinance shall retain, and make
available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to
any monitoring activities required by this
ordinance, any additional records of
information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the
User independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best
Management Practices established under
13.04.016 of this ordinance. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the dates
analyses were performed; who performed
the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3)
years. This period shall be automatically
extended for the duration of any litigation
concerning the User or the City, or where
the User has been specifically notified of a
longer retention period by the City
Manager or Director.

Requirement including Instantaneous
Limits, as defined by Section 2 multiplied
by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section 2 (Daily Maximum,
long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or
narrative standard) that the City Manager
or Director determines has caused, alone or
in combination with other discharges,
Interference or Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel
or the general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that
has caused imminent endangerment to the
public or to the environment, or has
resulted in the City Manager or Director’s
exercise of its emergency authority to halt
or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90)
days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an
individual wastewater discharge permit or a
general permit or enforcement order for
starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within forty-five
(45) days after the due date, any required

I. Any single, accidental discharge,
upset, bypass or toxic overload caused by a
user of the sewer system, or any single
failure of any sewer system user to comply
with the meaning or intent of this chapter,
including failure to maintain any required
pretreatment device, such as a grease trap
or grease interceptor, upon first inspection
by the city.
SECTION 2—ADMINISTRATIVE
ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
If a User of the sewer system is identified
as being in significant non-compliance, the
city may decide, at the discretion of the
Director of Public Works, to implement
compliance remedies commensurate to the
violation.
If a user originally identified as a nonsignificant
industrial user during the initial
survey or inventory becomes noncompliant,
the city may direct such user to
comply with the permitting requirements of
a significant industrial user, until such time
that the Director of Public Works deems
this action no longer necessary.

a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the City Manager or Director
may serve upon that User a written Notice
of Violation. Within [ ( )] days
of the receipt of such notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the User to
the City Manager or Director. Submission
of such a plan in no way relieves the User
of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of
Violation. Nothing in this Section shall
limit the authority of the City Manager or
Director to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a
Notice of Violation.
2.2 Consent Orders
The City Manager or Director may enter
into Consent Orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any User
responsible for noncompliance. Such
documents shall include specific action to
be taken by the User to correct the
noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued
pursuant to Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of
13.04.019 of this ordinance and shall be
judicially enforceable.
2.3 Show Cause Hearing
The City Manager or Director may order a
User which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or
a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, to appear before the City
Manager or Director and show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. Notice shall be served on the
User specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action,
the reasons for such action, and a request
that the User show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.
The notice of the meeting shall be served
personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least [______
(____)] days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any Authorized
Representative of the User as defined in
13.04.013 and required by Section 2.7 A of
13.04.018 of this ordinance. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
2.4 Compliance Orders
When the City Manager or Director finds
that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or
a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the City Manager or Director
may issue an order to the User responsible
for the discharge directing that the User
come into compliance within a specified
time. If the User does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer
13.04.010
13-40
service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed
and properly operated. Compliance orders
also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount
of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor
does a compliance order relieve the User of
liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the User.
2.5 Cease and Desist Orders
When the City Manager or Director finds
that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or
a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, or that the User’s past
violations are likely to recur, the City
Manager or Director may issue an order to
the User directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the User to:
A. Immediately comply with all
requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or
preventive action as may be needed to
properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations
and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance
of a cease and desist order shall not be a
bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the User.
2.6 Administrative Fines
A. When the City Manager or Director
finds that a User has violated, or continues
to violate, any provision of this ordinance,
an individual wastewater discharge permit,
or a general permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement, the City Manager
or Director may fine such User in an
amount not to exceed $25,000 for each
violation (Arizona Revised Statutes 49-
391). Such fines shall be assessed on a perviolation,
per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for
each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties
shall, after ten (10) calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of ten
percent (10%) of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of
ten percent (10%) per month. A lien
against the User’s property shall be sought
for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines
must file a written request for the City
Manager or Director to reconsider the fine
along with full payment of the fine amount
within five (5) days of being notified of the
fine. Where a request has merit, the City
Manager or Director may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the
User’s appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto,
shall be returned to the User. The City
Manager or Director may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the
fine.
13.04.010
13-41
D. Issuance of an administrative fine
shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the
User.
2.7 Emergency Suspensions
The City Manager or Director may
immediately suspend a User’s discharge,
discharge permit, or business license after
informal notice to the User, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The City Manager or
Director may also immediately suspend a
User’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW,
or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
A. Any User notified of a suspension
of its discharge shall immediately stop or
eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
User’s failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the
City Manager or Director may take such
steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage
to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The City
Manager or Director may allow the User to
recommence its discharge when the User
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
City Manager or Director that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in Section 2.8 of
13.04.019 of this ordinance are initiated
against the User.
B. A User that is responsible, in whole
or in part, for any discharge presenting
imminent endangerment shall submit a
detailed written statement, describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the City Manager or
Director prior to the date of any show cause
or termination hearing.
Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted
as requiring a hearing prior to any
Emergency Suspension under this Section.
2.8 Termination of Discharge
In addition to the provisions in Section 3.5
of 13.04.018 of this ordinance, any User
who violates the following conditions is
subject to discharge termination:
A. Violation of individual wastewater
discharge permit or general permit
conditions;
B. Failure to accurately report the
wastewater constituents and characteristics
of its discharge;
C. Failure to report significant changes
in operations or wastewater volume,
constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;
D. Refusal of reasonable access to the
User’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
E. Violation of the Pretreatment
Standards in 13.04.014 through 13.04.016
of this ordinance.
Such User will be notified of the proposed
termination of its discharge and be offered
an opportunity to show cause under Section
13.04.010
13-42
2.3 of 13.04.019 of this ordinance why the
proposed action should not be taken.
Exercise of this option by the City Manager
or Director shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the User.
2.9 Remedies Nonexclusive
The remedies provided for in this ordinance
are not exclusive. The City Manager or
Director may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a
noncompliant User. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the City’s enforcement
response plan. However, the City Manager
or Director may take other action against
any User when the circumstances warrant.
Further, the City Manager or Director is
empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any
noncompliant User.
SECTION 3—JUDICIAL
ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
3.1 Injunctive Relief
When the City Manager or Director finds
that a User has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or
a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement, the City Manager or Director
may petition the City of Douglas
Magistrate Court through the City’s
Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or
permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the individual wastewater
discharge permit, the general permit, order,
or other requirement imposed by this
ordinance on activities of the User. The
City Manager or Director may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal
and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the User to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a User.
3.2 Civil Penalties
A. A User who has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or a general permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other
Pretreatment Standard or Requirement shall
be liable to the City for a maximum civil
penalty of an amount not to exceed $25,000
for each violation (Arizona Revised
Statutes 49-391) and at least the amount of
$1,000 per violation, per day. In the case
of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for
each day during the period of the violation.
B. The City Manager or Director may
recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with
enforcement activities, including sampling
and monitoring expenses, and the cost of
any actual damages incurred by the City.
C. In determining the amount of civil
liability, the Court shall take into account
all relevant circumstances, including, but
not limited to, the extent of harm caused by
the violation, the magnitude and duration
of the violation, any economic benefit
gained through the User’s violation,
corrective actions by the User, the
13.04.010
13-43
compliance history of the User, and any
other factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against a User.
3.3 Criminal Prosecution
A. A User who willfully or negligently
violates any provision of this ordinance, an
individual wastewater discharge permit, or
a general permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other Pretreatment Standard or
Requirement shall, upon conviction, be
guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a
fine pursuant to state law per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than six
(6) months, or both.
B. A User who willfully or negligently
introduces any substance into the POTW

a class 1 misdemeanor and be subject to a
penalty of at least class 1, or be subject to
imprisonment for not more than six (6)
months, or both. This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage
available under State law.
C. A User who knowingly makes any
false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record,
report, plan, or other documentation filed,
or required to be maintained, pursuant to
this ordinance, individual wastewater
discharge permit, or general permit or order
issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers
with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any
monitoring device or method required
under this ordinance shall, upon conviction,
be punished by a fine of not more than by a
fine pursuant to state law per violation, per
day, or imprisonment for not more than six
(6) months, or both.
D. In the event of a second conviction,
a user shall be punished by a fine of not
more than pursuant to state law second
class 1 conviction allowable terms per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than six (6) months, or both.
SECTION 4—AFFIRMATIVE
DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE
VIOLATIONS
4.1 Upset
A. For the purposes of this Section,
upset means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the User.
An upset does not include noncompliance
to the extent caused by operational error,
improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an
affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A User who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the User can
identify the cause(s) of the upset;
13.04.010
13-44
(2) The facility was at the time being
operated in a prudent and workman-like
manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The User has submitted the following
information to the City Manager or
Director within twenty-four (24) hours of
becoming aware of the upset [if this
information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five
(5) days]:
(a) A description of the indirect discharge
and cause of noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including
exact dates and times or, if not corrected,
the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence
of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the
User seeking to establish the occurrence of
an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users shall have the opportunity for
a judicial determination on any claim of
upset only in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards.
F. Users shall control production of all
discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical
Pretreatment Standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where,
among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced,
lost, or fails.
4.2 Prohibited Discharge Standards
A User shall have an affirmative defense to
an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general
prohibitions in Section 2.1(A) of 13.04.018
of this ordinance or the specific
prohibitions in Sections (B)(1) through (B)(
21) of 13.04.015 of this ordinance if it can
prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in
conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause Pass Through or
Interference and that either:
A. A Local Limit exists for each
pollutant discharged and the User was in
compliance with each limit directly prior
to, and during, the Pass Through or
Interference; or
B. No Local Limit exists, but the
discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the User’s prior
discharge when the City was regularly in
compliance with its NPDES permit, and in
the case of Interference, was in compliance
with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
4.3 Bypass
A. For the purposes of this Section,
(1) Bypass means the intentional diversion
of wastestreams from any portion of a
User’s treatment facility.
(2) Severe property damage means
substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which
causes them to become inoperable, or
13.04.010
13-45
substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a
bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in
production.
B. A User may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause Pretreatment
Standards or Requirements to be violated,
but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the
provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this
Section.
C. Bypass Notifications
(1) If a User knows in advance of the
need for a bypass, it shall submit prior
notice to the City Manager or Director, at
least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
(2) A User shall submit oral notice to
the City Manager or Director of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable Pretreatment Standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it
becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within
five (5) days of the time the User becomes
aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of
the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times,
and, if the bypass has not been corrected,
the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence
of the bypass. The City Manager or
Director may waive the written report on a
case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty-four (24)
hours.
D. Bypass
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and the City
Manager or Director may take an
enforcement action against a User for a
bypass, unless
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss
of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to
the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate
back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable
engineering judgment to prevent a bypass
which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
(c) The User submitted notices as required
under paragraph (C) of this section.
(2) The City Manager or Director may
approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the City
Manager or Director determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in
paragraph (D)(1) of this Section.
SECTION 5—SUPPLEMENTAL

may be severed. Service will recommence,
at the User’s expense, only after the User
has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to
comply.
5.6 Public Nuisances {Optional}
A violation of any provision of this
ordinance, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, a general permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment
Standard or Requirement is hereby

14-102. - General Requirements
(a) All existing and proposed Food Service
Establishments (FSEs) are required to have
grease control equipment (GCE) installed,
maintained and operating properly, in
accordance with this FOG Management Policy.
(b) All FSEs will be required to maintain
records of cleaning and maintenance of GCE.
GCE maintenance records will be maintained
on-site of the FSE and include, at a minimum,
the date of cleaning/maintenance, company or
person conducting the cleaning/maintenance,
volume (in gallons) of grease wastewater
removed and the final disposal location. In
addition, grease waste haulers shall comply
with the City of Douglas manifest
documentation requirements for all disposal of
FOG waste.
(c) GCE maintenance records will be
available at the FSE premises so they can be
provided to the City inspector or their
representative, and/or the Health Department.
The FSE shall maintain GCE maintenance
records for three (3) years.
(d) No FSE will discharge oil and grease in
concentrations that exceed the City’s numerical
surcharge level (200 mg/L) for oil and grease
(animal or vegetable origin).
(e) Owners of Commercial Property will be
held responsible for installation of approved
grease control equipment and shall ensure that
lease agreements identify the responsible party
13.04.020
13-53 06/14/2017
for proper maintenance to control wastewater
discharges from leaseholder on their property.
(f) Grease Control Equipment Certification
Requirement:
All establishments with grease control
equipment must have their grease interceptor or
grease trap inspected and certified at least
annually, defined as period from January 1
through December 31, by a City “certified”
grease waste hauler or City licensed plumber.
Any FSE that does not provide an annual
grease control certification by December 31 of
each year will be considered to be in
noncompliance. If a grease interceptor or
grease trap “Passes” the certification
requirement, no further action is required. If a
grease interceptor or grease trap “Fails” the
certification requirement, a corrective action
response is required from the FSE owner or
authorized representative to the City within 30
days. Completed certification forms Grease
Interceptor Certification (Form A) or Grease
Trap Certification (Form B) must be completed
and signed by the City “certified” grease waste
hauler or City licensed plumber, signed by the
FSE owner or authorized representative, and
submitted to the City. The original certification
form must be submitted to the City at the
following address:
City of Douglas
Attn: FOG Program
425 10th Street
Douglas AZ 85607
(g) Failure of a Grease Interceptor
Certification or Grease Trap Certification: The
FSE owner or authorized representative is
responsible for including detailed “Corrective
Action Response” information on the Grease
Interceptor Certification form or the Grease
Trap Certification form that is submitted to the
City. If necessary, additional pages may be
attached to the certification form. At a
minimum, the Corrective Action Response
information must include the reason for the
failed certification, what corrective action will
be taken, and the date the corrective action will
be completed. Any additional enforcement
action will utilize the City of Douglas Food
Service Establishment Enforcement Response
Guide.
(h) FSEs shall observe Best Management
Practices (BMPs) for controlling the discharge
of FOG from their facility. Examples of BMPs
include, but are not limited to:
(1) Recycle waste cooking oil; dispose in
grease recycle bin or container. Do NOT pour
any grease into sinks, floor drains or mop sinks.
(2) Post “NO GREASE” signs above all
kitchen sinks to remind employees.
(3) “Dry wipe”, and scrape into a trash
container as much food particles and grease
residue from pots, pans, and plates as possible.
(4) Use strainers in sink drains and floor
drains to prevent large food particles and
containers from going into the sewer line.
(5) If an oil or grease spill occurs, clean up
using “dry” oil absorbent material or use ice to
make grease solidify. Scoop up and dispose
into a trash container. Do NOT wash oil or
grease into drains!
(6) Dispose of food items in the trash. Food
grinder use is discouraged due to build up of
solids in the GCE which causes decreased
efficiency and the need to increase pumping
frequency of the GCE.
(7) Educate and train all employees on
grease control and preventing sewer pipe clogs
and sewer overflows.
(i) FSEs shall dispose of yellow grease in an
approved container, or recycle container, and
13.04.020
13-54 06/14/2017
the contents shall not be discharged to any
sanitary sewer line, storm water grate, drain or
conveyance. Yellow grease or oils poured or
discharged into the FSE sewer lines or City’s
sewer system is a violation of this FOG
Management Policy.
(j) It shall be a violation of this FOG
Management Policy to push or flush the nonwater
portion of GCE into the public sewer.
13.03.013. - Approved Grease Waste Haulers
To ensure proper maintenance of grease control
equipment and proper disposal of the FOG
waste, the City will maintain an “Approved
Grease Waste Haulers List.” Criteria for the
grease waste hauler to be placed on the
“Approved Grease Waste Haulers List”
include, but are not limited to, the following:
(a) The grease waste hauler employees that
will be completing the food service
establishment grease control equipment
certification forms must attend a City of
Douglas Grease Control Equipment
Certification Class and pass the GCE
certification class test. Class information may
be obtained at the City of Douglas Wastewater
Department or City of Douglas
________________.
(b) Grease waste haulers and plumbers that
pump grease interceptors or grease traps must
comply with the requirements of the City’s
FOG Management Policy.
(c) Signature of the grease waste hauler
company’s authorized representative and
submittal to the City of a completed “City of
Douglas Approved Grease Waste Hauler
Agreement” form are required.
(1) The grease waste hauler agreement will
include grease waste hauler reporting
requirements to the City and making records
available to City personnel or their authorized
representative. Failure to meet any portion of
the grease waste hauler agreement will result in
removal of the grease waste hauler from the
“City of Douglas Approved Grease Waste
Haulers List” and/or additional enforcement
action.
13.06.014. - Grease Control Equipment
Requirements
(a) Any new FSE, existing FSE, upgrading
of an existing FSE, or change of ownership of
existing FSE will be required to install and
maintain a GCE. Food service establishments
in one of these categories must submit a FOG
plan to the City for approval. The FOG plan
must include identification of all cooking and
food preparation equipment (i.e., fryers, grills,
woks, etc.), the number and size of all kitchen
plumbing fixture drains (i.e., for dishwashers,
sinks, floor drains, etc.), type of FSE
classification, type of food to be served, and
plans for the grease interceptor dimensions and
location. The FSE or their representative will
complete a City Grease Control Inquiry Form
and submit the form to the City. The City’s
Grease Control Inquiry Form will serve as the
FSE’s application for a FOG Control Permit.
The City will review the FOG plan, grease
interceptor sizing and approve, or make
changes as necessary, to aid in the protection of
a FOG discharge from the FSE.
(b) Prior to installation, all proposed GCEs
shall meet the City FOG Program
Coordinator’s, or their designee’s, approval and
meet the design specifications as stated in this
FOG Management Policy. Only specifically
City approved GCE and fixtures can be
installed or connected to the grease waste line.
(c) New construction of FSEs shall have
separate sanitary (restroom) and kitchen
process lines. The kitchen process lines shall be
13.04.020
13-55 06/14/2017
plumbed to appropriately sized GCE. No
sanitary wastewater (black water) or storm
water shall be plumbed to the GCE.
(d) All of the FSEs internal plumbing shall
be constructed to separate sanitary (restroom)
flow from kitchen process flow. Sanitary flow
and kitchen process discharges shall be
approved separately by the City and shall
discharge from the building separately.
Kitchen process lines and sanitary lines may
combine prior to entering the public sewer;
however the lines cannot be combined until
after the GCE.
(e) Grease Interceptors or Grease Traps will
be installed and connected so that it is easily
accessible for inspection, cleaning and removal
of grease at any time.
(f) Existing Food Service Establishments are
required to meet these FOG Management
Policy requirements no later than 120 days
after the effective date of this FOG
Management Policy. The City may allow
additional time on a case-by-case basis for the
FSE to meet FOG Management Policy
requirements if there are documented
extenuating circumstances.
(g) New Multi-Unit (Strip Mall) Facilities:
New strip malls or strip centers must have two
separate sewer line connections at each unit
within the strip mall or strip center. One sewer
line will be for sanitary wastewater and one
sewer line will be for the kitchen area, or
potential kitchen area, of each unit. The kitchen
area, or potential kitchen area, sewer line will
be connected to floor drains in the specified
kitchen area, and will connect, or be able to
connect, to other food service establishment
kitchen fixtures, such as 3-compartment sink,
2-compartment sink, pre-rinse sink, mop sink
and hand wash sink.
(1) New multi-unit facility, or new “strip
mall” facility, owners shall contact the City
prior to conducting private plumbing work at
the multi-unit facility site. Multi-unit facility
owners, or their designated contractor, shall
have plans for separate private wastewater lines
for kitchen and sanitary wastewater for each
“individual” unit. In addition, the plans shall
identify “stub-out” locations to accommodate a
minimum 1,000-gallon grease interceptor for
each unit of the multi-unit facility, or provide a
larger capacity grease interceptor that could be
shared by multiple FSEs in the strip mall. City
approval for multiple FSEs connected to one
grease interceptor or series of grease
interceptors must be approved by the City prior
to construction. New multi-unit facility, or new
“strip mall” facility owners shall consider
suitable physical property space and sewer
gradient that will be conducive to the
installation of an exterior, in-ground grease
interceptor when determining the building
location.
(2) FSEs located in a new multi-unit facility
shall have a minimum of a 1,000-gallon grease
interceptor installed, unless that FSE is
identified as a Class 1 facility. Sanitary
wastewater, or black water, shall not be
connected to GCE.
(h) Variance to Grease Interceptor
Installation: At the discretion of the Director, a
FSE may receive a variance from the required
installation of a grease interceptor. Variances
will be limited to existing FSEs that have
unusual physical location circumstances that
will prevent the installation of a large grease
interceptor. Sizing will be based on the
Standard PDI-G101 of the Plumbing &
Drainage Institute, simplified chart, wherever
possible.
13.04.020
13-56 06/14/2017
(i) Alternative Grease Control Equipment: At
the discretion of the Director, alternative grease
control equipment may be considered and
approved for installation at a FSE. The
alternative grease control equipment must
control FOG discharges from a FSE and be
maintained as outlined in this FOG
Management Policy.
(j) Approval of Grease Control Equipment: All
new FSEs and FSEs that upgrade their facilities
(including the addition of new plumbing
fixtures or kitchen equipment which, directly or
indirectly, affects grease discharge) must
contact the City for final approval of the grease
control equipment. This will include onsite
inspection of the grease control equipment by
the City, or their authorized representative.
Failure of the FSE to contact the City to
conduct the inspection of the new GCE will
result in enforcement action.
13.06.015. - Grease Control Equipment Sizing
(a) Minimum acceptable size of grease
control equipment for each FSE Classification
will be as follows:
(1) Class 1: Delis, Ice Cream shops,
Beverage Bars, Mobile Food Vendors, Day
Care facilities (minimum classification) 20-
gpm/40 pound Grease Trap (NAICS 722515,
722330, 624410). Exceptions to Class 1 are
doughnut shops with on premise baking and
large coffee shops, which are classified as
Class 2 facilities.
(2) Class 2: LimitedService
Restaurants/
Carry-out/Caterers/Day Care facilities
(maximum classification)/ Full Service
Restaurants (minimum classification)/ Buffet
and Cafeteria facilities (minimum
classification) 1,000-
gallon Grease
Interceptor (NAICS 722513, 722511, 72514,
722320, 624410)
(3) Class 3: Full-Service Restaurants 1,500-
gallon Grease Interceptor (NAICS
722511)

722310, 813110, 922140)
(b) To calculate the appropriate size GCE,
the FSE’s engineer, architect, licensed plumber
or contractor should use a formula that
considers all kitchen plumbing fixture units, the
discharge plumbing pipe for each fixture unit,
storage capacity, type of facility and an
adequate retention time. The grease control
equipment minimum acceptable size for the
above listed FSE classifications (Class 1
through 5) shall be met.
(c) The City will review GCE sizing
information received from the completed
Grease Control Inquiry Form and the FSE’s
sizing calculations and information. The City
will make a decision to approve, or require
additional grease interceptor volume, based on
the type of FSE, the number of fixture units,
and additional calculations. Each grease
interceptor tank capacity should not exceed
2,000 gallons. In the event that the grease
interceptor calculated capacity needs to exceed
2,000 gallons, the FSE shall install an
additional interceptor of the appropriate size in
series.
(d) Grease interceptors that are installed in
series shall be installed in such a manner to
ensure positive flow between the tanks at all
times. Therefore, tanks shall be installed so that
the inlet invert of each successive tank shall be
13.04.020
13-57 06/14/2017
a minimum of 2 inches below the outlet invert
of the preceding tank.
(e) Grease Control Equipment must remove
fats, oils and grease at or below the City of
Douglas oil and grease (animal or vegetable
origin) limit of 200 mg/L.
13.06.016. - Grease Interceptor Design and
Installation
(a) Piping Design
(1) The inlet and outlet piping shall have
2way
cleanout tees installed.
(2) The inlet piping shall enter the receiving
chamber 2 ½ inches above the invert of the
outlet piping.
(3) On the inlet pipe, inside the receiving
chamber, a sanitary tee of the same size pipe in
the vertical position with the top unplugged
shall be provided as a turndown. To provide air
circulation and to prevent “air lock”, a pipe
(nipple) installed in the top tee shall extend to a
minimum of 6” clearance from the interceptor
ceiling, but not less that the inlet pipe diameter.
A pipe installed in the bottom of the tee shall
extend to a point of 2/3 the depth of the tank.
The inlet T should be made of Schedule 40
PVC or equivalent material. See illustration
Figure 1.
(4) The outlet piping shall be no smaller
than the inlet piping, but in no case smaller
than 4” ID.
(5) The outlet piping shall extend to 12”
above the floor of the interceptor and shall be
made of a noncollapsible
material. Minimum
materials requirement for outlet piping is
Schedule 40 PVC.
(6) The outlet piping shall contain a tee
installed vertically with a pipe (nipple) installed
in the top of the tee to extend to a minimum of
6” clearance from the interceptor ceiling, but
not less that the pipe diameter, with the top
open. Minimum requirement for the outlet tee
is Schedule 40 PVC. See illustration.
(a) Baffles
(1) The grease interceptor shall have a
nonflexing
(i.e. concrete, steel, etc.) baffle
extending the full width of the interceptor,
sealed to the walls and the floor, and extending
from the floor to within 6” of the ceiling. The
baffle shall have an inverted 90 degree sweep,
or schedule 40 PVC tee, fitting at least equal in
diameter size to the inlet piping, but in no case
less than 6” ID. The bottom of the sweep shall
be placed in the vertical position in the inlet
compartment 12” above the floor. The sweep
shall rise to the horizontal portion, which shall
extend through the baffle into the outlet
compartment. The baffle wall shall be sealed to
the sweep. See illustration.
(2) The inlet compartment shall be 2/3 of
the total liquid capacity with the outlet
compartment at 1/3 liquid capacity of the
interceptor.
(b) Access Openings (Manholes)
(1) Access to grease interceptors shall be
provided by a minimum of 1 manhole per
interceptor division (baffle chamber) and of
24inch
minimum dimensions terminating 1
inch above finished grade with cast iron frame
and cover. An 8” thick concrete pad extending
a minimum of 12’’ beyond the outside
dimension of the manhole frame shall be
provided. One manhole shall be located above
the inlet tee hatch and the other manhole shall
be located above the outlet tee hatch. A
minimum of 24” of clear opening above each
manhole access shall be maintained to facilitate
maintenance, cleaning, pumping, and
inspections.
(2) Access openings shall be mechanically
sealed and gas tight to contain odors and
13.04.020
13-58 06/14/2017
bacteria and to exclude vermin and ground
water, in a manner that permits regular reuses.
(3) The manholes shall be accessible for
inspection by the City.
(c) Additional Requirements
(1) Water Tight – Precast concrete grease
interceptors shall be constructed to be
watertight. A static water test shall be
conducted by the installer and timed so as to
permit verification through visual inspection by
City or regulatory agent. The water test shall
consist of plugging the outlet (and the inlet if
necessary) and filling the tank(s) with water to
the tank top a minimum of 24 hours before the
inspection. The tank shall not lose water during
this test period. Certification by the plumbing
contractor shall be supplied to the City prior to
final approval of grease control equipment.
(2) Location – Grease interceptors shall be
located so as to be readily accessible for
cleaning, maintenance, and inspections. They
should be located close to the fixture(s)
discharging the greasy wastewater. If possible,
grease interceptors should not be installed in
“drive-thru” lanes or parking areas. Grease
interceptor access manholes shall never be
paved over, covered by landscaping, or have
any other hindrances to allow access.
(3) Load-Bearing Capacity: Each
interceptor shall be structurally designed to
withstand any anticipated load to be placed on
the interceptor (i.e. vehicular traffic in parking
or driving areas). This includes any “risers” or
other extensions for the interceptor manholes to
insure that any large commercial vehicle will
not cause a collapse of the structure.

Interceptors shall be constructed of sound
durable materials, not subject to excessive
corrosion or decay, and shall be water and gas
tight.
(5) Concrete materials and other grease
interceptor materials shall meet the American
National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and
International Association of Plumbing and
Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) standards.
(6) Marking and Identification -

depth of earth cover in feet; and
f. Inlet and outlet
Figure 1 Grease Interceptor Typical Detail
13.06.017. - Grease Interceptor Cleaning and
Maintenance Requirements
(a) Partial pump of interceptor contents or
onsite
pump and treatment of interceptor
contents will NOT be allowed due to
reintroduction of fats, oils and grease to the
interceptor. In no way shall the pumped
material be returned to any private or public
portion of the sanitary sewer collection system.
All grease waste haulers and procedures for
pumping grease interceptors shall be in
compliance with this FOG Management Policy.
13.04.020
13-59 06/14/2017
(b) Responsibility – Maintaining the grease
interceptor(s), including complete pumping of
contents at the required frequency and insuring
proper components are installed, is the
responsibility of the user/owner. Commercial
property owners shall ensure that lease
agreements identify the responsible party for
proper maintenance to control wastewater
discharges from leaseholder on their property.
(c) Grease interceptors must be
pumpedinfull
(total pump of all contents)
when the total accumulations of surface FOG
(including floating solids) and settled solids
reaches twenty-five percent (25%) of the grease
interceptor’s inlet liquid depth. This criterion is
referred to as the “25 Percent Rule”. At no
time, shall the cleaning frequency exceed 90
days unless approved in writing by the City.
Failure to meet this requirement shall result in
enforcement action. Approval will be granted
on a case by case situation with submittal by
the FSE documenting proof that a reduced
cleaning frequency will meet the requirements
of this FOG Management Policy. Some
existing FSEs in Class 2 through 5 may need to
consider a more frequent pumping schedule to
meet this requirement. A City approved
manifest of grease interceptor
cleaning/maintenance, and an FSE grease
interceptor self-monitoring checklist shall be
maintained onsite at the FSE and provided to
the City upon request. These documents need
to be provided to the City for review before
approval can be granted for a cleaning
frequency to exceed 90 days.
(d) The Grease interceptor’s influent-T and
effluent-T will be inspected during cleaning
and maintenance and the condition noted by the
grease waste hauler’s company or individual
conducting the maintenance. Influent and
effluentTs
that are loose, defective, or not
attached must be repaired or replaced
immediately. Grease waste haulers or
individuals conducting any maintenance or
pumping will use caution to not damage or
dislodge Ts, or cause other grease interceptor
component damage. Any repairs to the grease
interceptor should be documented and kept on
file at the FSE.
(e) Grease Interceptors must have access
manholes over the influentT
and effluentT
for
inspection and ease of cleaning/maintenance.
Access manholes will be provided for all
separate compartments of interceptors for
complete cleaning (i.e. interceptor with two
main baffles or three compartments will have
access manholes at each compartment). The
manholes are to be accessible for inspection by
the City.
(f) Grease Interceptor waste must be hauled
offsite and disposed at a State and POTW
approved disposal location. All disposal of
grease interceptor waste must meet the
requirements of City of Douglas Ordinances.
City approved manifests must be used.
(g) Grease Interceptors must be “certified”
annually by a City approved grease waste
hauler or plumber. A Grease Interceptor
Certification (Form A) must be completed and
submitted to the City annually.
(h) The City may mandate the FSE to
require the grease waste hauler to contact the
City by telephone at least 24 hours prior to any
cleaning, pumping, maintenance, inspection, or
certification of the grease interceptor. The City
has the right to be present to inspect all
maintenance.
13.06.018. - Grease Trap Sizing, Installation,
Cleaning, and Maintenance
(a) All grease traps will have a properly
installed and vented flow control restrictor.
13.04.020
13-60 06/14/2017
Failure to have the flow restrictor and venting
will be considered a violation.
(b) All new FSEs that are allowed to install
grease traps must have City written approval
prior to starting operations.
(c) A Grease Trap’s minimum size
requirement is 20-gallon-per-minute/40-pound
capacity. Drainage time of particular kitchen
fixtures, such as a 3 compartment sink, should
be considered when selecting the grease trap
size.
(d) Grease Traps must have the Plumbing
Drainage Institute certification, and be installed
as per manufacturer’s specifications.
(e) At the discretion of the Director,
alternative grease control equipment may be
considered and approved for installation. The
alternative grease control equipment must
control FOG discharges and be maintained as
outlined in this FOG Management Policy.
(f) No automatic dishwasher shall be connected
to an under-the-sink grease trap or floor grease
trap. Dishwashers will cause hydraulic
overload of the grease trap.
(g) No automatic drip or feed system for
additives is allowed prior to entering the grease
trap without written approval from the City.
(h) A single grease trap device shall be
installed for each significant kitchen fixture
unit (i.e. each 3 compartment sink), unless the
Director or FOG Program Coordinator provides
written approval for multiple fixtures to be
connected to the grease trap. The City must
approve the number of grease traps and
connections to the grease trap.
(i) During each cleaning of the grease trap, the
flow restrictor shall be checked to ensure it is
attached and operational.
(j) Grease Traps will be completely cleaned of
fats, oils and grease and food solids at a
minimum of every thirty (30) days. If the FOG
and food solids content of the grease trap are
greater than 25%, then the grease trap must be
cleaned as frequently as needed to prevent 25%
of capacity being occupied with FOG and food
solids. A written record of grease trap cleaning
and maintenance shall be maintained onsite at
the FSE and provided to the City upon request.
(k) Grease Trap waste shall be sealed or
placed in a container to prevent leachate from
leaking, and then disposed or hauled offsite by
a grease waste hauler or plumber to an
approved disposal location. In no way shall the
pumped material be returned to any private or
public portion of the sanitary sewer collection
system. All grease waste haulers, plumbers,
and procedures for pumping grease traps shall
be in compliance with the City of Douglas
Ordinances and this FOG Management Policy.
(l) Grease Trap waste shall not be mixed with
yellow grease in the grease recycle container.
(m) Grease Traps must be “certified”
annually. See General Requirements of this
FOG Management Policy.
(n) The City may mandate the FSE to
require the grease waste hauler to contact the
City by telephone at least 24 hours prior to any
cleaning, pumping, maintenance, inspection, or
certification of the grease trap. The City has the
right to be present to inspect all maintenance.
13.06.019. - Best Management Practices and
Accidental Discharge Prevention
Food Service Establishments shall implement
Best Management Practices to prevent the
discharge of fats, oils and grease to the City
sanitary sewer system. Food Service
Establishments shall provide such facilities and
institute such procedures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent or minimize the potential
for accidental discharge of fats, oils, and grease
into the sewage collection system.
13.04.020
13-61 06/14/2017
13.06.020. - “Additives” Limitations and
Prohibitions for Use
(a) Additives include but are not limited to
products that contain solvents, emulsifiers,
surfactants, caustics, acids, enzymes, and
bacteria.
(b) Any additive(s) placed into the food
service establishment discharge line system or
grease interceptor on a constant, regular, or
scheduled basis shall be reported to the City. If
the City identifies FOG in the downstream
sewer system from a FSE that is using an
additive, then the City can require the FSE to
discontinue use of the additive.
(c) No additive can be used prior to the
grease trap (inside under-the-sink or floor trap).
(d) Additive use will not be a substitute for
regular, required cleaning, or pumping of
grease control equipment as required in this
FOG Management Policy.
(e) This FOG Management Policy prohibits
the use of chemicals, acids, caustics, enzymes,
hot water, emulsifiers, surfactants, or other
additives to cause oil or grease to pass through
the user's grease trap or grease interceptor
designed to remove oil and grease.
13.06.021. - Private Sewer Line Cleaning of
FOG Requirement
Any grease waste hauler, plumber, or
contractor that cleans FOG from a food service
establishments’ private sewer lines must insure
that the FOG and other debris cleaned from the
private sewer lines does not cause an
obstruction or blockage in the City’s sanitary
sewer system. The FOG or other debris cleaned
from the private sewer line should be
“vactored” or removed by the grease waste
hauler, plumber, or contractor prior to entry
into the City sanitary sewer system to prevent
obstruction or blockage to the City’s sanitary
sewer system. The grease waste hauler,
plumber, or contractor shall immediately
contact the City if FOG is “pushed” or “jetted”
into the City sanitary sewer system to make the
City aware of the FOG and debris at the
specific location.
13.06.022. - Right of Entry, Inspections, and
Monitoring
(a) The City, or their authorized
representative, shall have the right to enter the
premises of FSEs to determine whether the
FSE is complying with the requirements of this
FOG Management Policy as part of the City of
Douglas, Municipal Code, Chapter 13.06.
FSEs shall allow City personnel, or their
authorized representative, upon presentation of
proper credentials, full access to all parts of the
premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, and/or records examination.
Unreasonable delays in allowing City
personnel access to the FSE premises shall be a
violation of this FOG Management Policy.
(b) All grease interceptors and traps shall be
subject to review, evaluation and inspection by
the City or their authorized representative.
Inspections will determine proper maintenance,
changes in operation, proper records and files,
ability of interceptor or trap to prevent grease
from entering the system, and any other factors
pertaining to the control of grease discharges to
the City sewer system. The City can require the
FSE to notify the City 24 hours prior to any
pumping, cleaning, maintenance, or
certification of the GCE so the City can do a
visual inspection of the total GCE tank. The
City can require the FSE to schedule pumping
of their interceptor if the City determines that
the interceptor may be defective or there is
chronic FOG obstruction in the downstream
sewer from the FSE. City personnel, or their
13.04.020
13-62 06/14/2017
authorized representative, reserve the right to
make determinations of interceptor or trap
condition, and adequacy based on review of all
information regarding the interceptor’s or
trap’s performance and can require increased
cleaning frequency, additional maintenance,
modification or replacement of the GCE. All
records will be available on site for review by
City personnel, or their authorized
representative, for a period of 36 months.
Copies shall be provided upon request from the
City.
(c) The City may require that the FSE
install monitoring or additional pretreatment
equipment deemed necessary for compliance
with this FOG Management Policy as part of
the City of Douglas, Municipal Code, Chapter
13.06.
13.01.023. - Fees and Permits
(a) The City may charge inspection,
monitoring, assessment, impact, surcharge,
commercial food facility, and/or permit fees to
the food service establishments to get
reimbursement for the FOG program and/or
POTW impact costs.
(b) A monthly FOG program surcharge fee
may be added to each FSE’s Wastewater bill.
(c) An additional compliance inspection fee
may be charged to each food service
establishment for each re-inspection due to
noncompliance issues.
(d) The City may issue FOG Control
Permits to food service establishments. All new
FSEs shall complete the City’s Grease Control
Inquiry Form and submit the form to the City,
which will serve as the FSE’s FOG permit
application. The City’s FOG inspection form
will serve as the permit application for existing
FSEs. FOG Control Permits may be issued for
a period or duration of up to 5 years. Additional
fees may be implemented by the City for food
service establishment wastewater treatment and
impacts to the POTW.
13.01.024. - FOG Treatment, Disposal, and
Resource Recovery Plan
The City may implement a FOG Treatment,
Disposal, and Resource Recovery Plan (Plan).
The plan may be implemented if problems
continue with FOG disposal, FOG obstruction
in the sewer system, or inconsistent
maintenance of FSE grease control equipment
provided by grease waste haulers to prevent
FOG discharges. The plan may include a
Request For Proposal (RFP) for the treatment
and disposal of FOG waste generated from the
City of Douglas food service establishments.
The RFP may include that the successful RFP
respondent provide some form of beneficial
reuse of the FOG waste that is treated. Also,
the RFP may include a cost estimate for
maintenance (complete pump of grease
interceptors and grease traps) and certification
of the grease control equipment of all City of
Douglas food service establishment grease
interceptors and grease traps. The results of the
RFP may provide a single source for GCE
pumping, GCE certification, FOG treatment,
FOG disposal, and reporting to the City. The
City will implement quality control practices to
ensure that the successful RFP respondent
meets all RFP requirements. In addition, the
total cost of the food service establishment
GCE pumping, and FOG treatment and
disposal should be the same or lower cost than
the average market cost of GCE maintenance
as determined by the City.
13.01.025. - Violations and Enforcement
Action
(a) Enforcement action against the food
service establishment includes, but is not
limited to, failure to clean or pump grease
13.04.020
13-63 06/14/2017
control equipment, failure to maintain grease
control equipment including installation of a
properly functioning influent/effluentT
and
baffle(s), failure to install grease control
equipment, failure to control FOG discharge
from the FSE, failure to certify the grease
interceptor or trap, FSE responsible for sewer
line obstruction, FSE responsible for a sanitary
sewer overflow, and FSE use of additives so
that FOG is diluted and pushed downstream of
the FSE.
(b) Whenever City personnel, or their
authorized representative, determine that a
grease interceptor or trap is in need of
installation, pumping, repairs, maintenance, or
replacement, a Noncompliance Notification
(NCN) or a Notice of Violation (NOV) will be
issued stating the nature of the violation(s) and
timeframe for corrective measures.
(c) If the FSE fails to initiate corrective
action in response to a NCN or NOV, a second
notice will be issued and additional fees may be
assessed. Fees may include compliance
inspection fees, costs associated with service
calls for sewer line blockages, line cleaning,
camera trucks, line and pump repairs, including
all labor, material and equipment. Further noncompliance
will result in escalation in
enforcement action.
(d) Immediate discontinuance of City of
Douglas wastewater services may be issued if
the facility presents an imminent endangerment
to the health, welfare of person or to the
environment, causes stoppages or excessive
City maintenance of the sanitary sewer system,
causes significant interference with the
wastewater treatment plant, or causes the City
to violate any condition of its Aquifer
Protection permit. Service shall be reinstated
when such conditions have been eliminated and
after payment of reconnection fees or other
assessed fees.
(e) In addition to any inspection or violation
fees, any user who is found to have violated
this FOG Management Policy, then
enforcement action responses according to the
City of FOG Management Policy as part of the
City of Douglas, Municipal Code, Chapter
13.06 may be enforced.
(f) If inspections and field investigations
determine that any fats, oils and grease
interference or blockage in the POTW
(including the sewer system, a sewage pumping
station, or the wastewater treatment plant) is
caused by a particular user, or food service
establishment, then that user, or FSE, may be
required to reimburse the City for all labor,
equipment, supplies and disposal costs incurred
by City to clean the interference or blockage.
The charges will be added to the user’s or
FSE’s utility bill. Failure to reimburse the City
may result in termination of utility services.
(g) For all other violations not specifically
mentioned above, the City will use the City of
Douglas Food Service Establishment
Enforcement Response Guide as a guide for
enforcement action. (Ord. 17-1070 § 1, 2017).

Executive Summary
On November 23, 1988, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
amended the General Pretreatment Regulations
requiring all Publicly Owned Treatment Works
(POTWs) with approved pretreatment
programs to develop and implement an
Enforcement Response Plan (ERP) to provide
guidance to Control Authority personnel in
identifying, documenting and responding to
pretreatment violations.
13.04.020
13-65 06/14/2017
The Clean Water Act (CWA) sets forth basic
requirements to regulate the nature and quantity
of industrial wastes discharged to POTWs;
regulations such as 40 CFR § 403. The U.S.
EPA has revised part 403 pursuant to sections
307(b) and 402(b) (8) of the CWA. The most
recent revision to part 403 resulted in the
promulgation of a final rule on October 14,
2005. Contained within part 403.8(f) (5) is a
list of minimum requirements for the
development of an ERP.
The elements of the ERP identified below
describe a process to identify, document and
respond to pretreatment violations in a timely
and equitable manner consistent with relevant
State and Federal law and with the legal
authority contained in Title 13, Water and
Sewer Code, also known as the sewer use
ordinance (SUO). The goal of the ERP is to
describe the manner in which the City of
Douglas (City) enforces its Pretreatment
Program to meet Federal and State pretreatment
program requirements.
The key elements of the ERP meet the
requirements of Federal regulations at 40 CFR
403.8(f)(5):
• Describe how the POTW will investigate
instances of noncompliance;
• Describe the types of escalating enforcement
responses the POTW will take in response to
all anticipated types of industrial user
violations and the time periods within which
responses will take place;
• Identify (by title) the official(s) responsible
for each type of response; and
• Adequately reflect the POTW’s primary
responsibility to enforce all applicable
pretreatment requirements and standards, as
detailed in 40 CFR § 403.8(f) (1) and (2).
Food Service Establishments (FSEs) within the
City of Douglas service area are subject to the
FSE Enforcement Response Guide (FSE-ERG)
which exists as a separate document. The FSEERG
ensures a consistent response to all food
service establishments that cause, or have the
potential to cause, interference, obstruction,
sanitary sewer overflows, bypasses, or storm
water inflow to the City sanitary sewer
collection system and wastewater treatment
plants. FSEs are nondomestic users and are
monitored by the City under its Fats, Oils and
Grease (FOG) Control Program. This FSEERG
is intended to be used for food service
establishments and users that contribute FOG
to the City’s sanitary sewer system. Refer to
the City’s SUO and FOG Management Policy
for additional information on the City’s FOG
control program.
Section 13.07.010 Methods to Investigate
Noncompliance
Methods used by the POTW to investigate the
compliance status of the Industrial User (User)
include but are not limited to, the following:
1.1 Field Inspections. Field Inspection is an
on-site presence of trained personnel to gather
data for immediate fact determination or
evaluation of compliance. The types of data
gathered include documents, statements, and
observations. Physical evidence and
information may also be collected as evidence
that may lead to enforcement.
1.2 Surveillance Sampling. Surveillance
sampling is performed by obtaining a
representative sample of a discharged
substance in accordance with regulatory
requirements. Typically, surveillance samples
of discharge from User operations are taken by
Pretreatment personnel.
1.3 Document Review. Document review
includes the analysis of data that relates to the
compliance status of a User, such as User
13.04.020
13-66 06/14/2017
correspondence, Self-Monitoring Report
Forms, and Baseline Monitoring Reports.
1.4 Meetings. Meetings, both formal and
informal, with a User are utilized to obtain and
share information which relates to any aspect
of the Pretreatment Program. Meetings may be
used to investigate technical issues (laboratory
analysis, sampling procedures/locations,
application of regulations, etc.) or concerns
about the compliance status of a User, or to
gather facts concerning alleged violations.
1.5 Increased Monitoring. Increased
monitoring by submission of samples and/or
records may be required of the User to provide
further data to demonstrate the compliance
status.
1.6 Technical Evaluation/Research. In
making the determination of a User’s
compliance status when substantial technical
considerations exist, an evaluation of the best
available scientific and technical information
will be made. This evaluation may include the
assistance of technical resource people,
industrial or regulatory subject matter experts,
or documents from research, pilot studies, etc.
1.7 Interaction with other Agencies. Review
of local and State files, communication with the
State and local Departments of Environmental
Quality, the Southern Arizona Environmental
Crimes Task Force, and the City’s Attorney’s
Office, is utilized to further investigate the
compliance status.
1.8 Other Methods. Other methods to
establish the compliance status may be used as
the need arises on a case-by-case basis.
Section 13.07.020 Enforcement/Types of
Escalating Responses
This section describes the range of available
enforcement actions. The enforcement
philosophy is progressive; that is, problems are
addressed at the lowest level and with the least
formality possible, consistent with the specific
program. However, it should be remembered
that the severity of the enforcement action is
not dependent upon the completion of any less
formal procedures and, depending upon the
factual scenario presented, a formal procedure
may be needed for the initial action. Listed
below are available enforcement actions.
2.1 Deterrents to Enforcement Actions
2.1.A Annual Public Notice.
In accordance with the requirements and
definition of significant noncompliance (SNC)
in the City’s SUO, a list of Users who are in
SNC at any time during the previous year is
published in a newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provide meaningful public
notice within 120 days of the end of the
calendar year.
2.2 Pre-Enforcement
2.2.A Request for Information.
A request for information to determine if
noncompliance is occurring can be verbal or
written.
2.2.B Regulatory Compliance Assistance.
Meetings are held for Users to discuss
compliance questions and to assist the User in
understanding the requirements of the Permit
and to identify available resources.
2.2.C Verbal Warnings.
An attempt to make contact is made by
telephone to a User’s authorized representative,
explaining the nature of the discrepancy. The
User is encouraged to return to compliance.
2.2.D Written Warning.
A written warning may be sent to a User’s
authorized representative explaining the nature
of the discrepancy and seeking further
information in determining noncompliance.
2.3 Enforcement
2.3.A Notification of Violation (NOV).
13.04.020
13-67 06/14/2017
A Notification of Violation states the
violation(s), may require submittal of
information, and requires the User to take any
corrective action necessary to prevent the
recurrence of the violation(s). An NOV may
include, but is not limited to:
• An Order of Corrective Action. This order
requires the User to carry out a corrective plan
of action to prevent the recurrence of
noncompliance. The User has ten (10) days to
respond in writing (from the time of receipt of
the letter) explaining reasons for the
violation(s) and detailing a plan of corrective
action.
• An Order to Respond. An Order to respond
requires the User to respond in writing to
allegations of noncompliance.
• A Compliance Schedule. A Compliance
Schedule may be made part of an enforcement
order. The deadline dates are subject to civil
penalties and are as enforceable as a discharge
limit.
• An Order to Show Cause. An Order to Show
Cause is an action to allow the User the
opportunity to “show cause” why the City
should not request the City of Douglas
Attorney to petition the courts to impose,
assess, and recover a sum not to exceed One
Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each day in
which the violation(s) has occurred. The User
has ten (10) days to respond in writing
explaining the reasons for the violation(s) and
detailing a plan of corrective action.
• An Order to Cease Discharge. An Order to
Cease Discharge orders the User to cease
discharge of industrial waste to the POTW by a
specified time as provided in the order, and to
carry out a corrective plan of action to prevent
the recurrence of noncompliance to enable the
lifting of the cease discharge order. In addition,
a show cause meeting is scheduled. The User is
required to respond within ten (10) Days in
writing to the NOV. A meeting between the
User and the POTW will occur at the earliest
convenience of the User, but no later than the
date specified in the Order.
• Intent to Suspend. Intent to Suspend
establishes a performance standard which must
be demonstrated within a specific time limit.
Failure to comply invokes permit suspension.
• Permit Suspension. Permit Suspension states
the violation(s), informs the User of permit
suspension, and outlines the corrective
action(s) the User must carry out before the
permit is reactivated and the City Manager or
Director reallows discharge. In addition, a
show cause meeting may be scheduled. The
User has ten (10) days to respond in writing to
the NOV.
• Permit Revocation. Permit Revocation
informs the User of permit revocation and
discharge prohibition and outlines corrective
action(s) the User must carry out before the
User can apply for a new permit. The User has
ten (10) days to respond in writing to the NOV.
• Other Orders. The City Manager or Director
may issue additional Orders determined
appropriate. Additional Orders and changes to
a Suspension or Revocation may follow the
initial Order at the discretion of the City
Manager or Director or as additional
information becomes available.
2.3.B Sewer Service Termination.
Sewer Service Termination is authorized when
it is necessary to cease a discharge from a User
that could present a hazard to public health,
safety or welfare, environment, or the POTW.
2.3.C Emergency Authority.
The use of Emergency Authority is authorized
when a violation presents an immediate hazard
to public health, safety or welfare,
environment, or to the POTW. Any of the
13.04.020
13-68 06/14/2017
enforcement action options can be used in the
event of the need for Emergency Authority
invocation, including judicial actions consisting
of temporary restraining orders or preliminary
or permanent injunctions.
2.3.D Judicial Actions.
Whenever the City Manager or Director finds
that a User has violated any of the provisions of
the City’s SUO the City of Douglas Attorney
may be requested to take appropriate legal
action. This legal action may include, but is not
limited to:
• Prohibitive injunctions;
• Mandatory injunctions for corrective action
and cleanup;
• Civil penalties pursuant to ARS § 49-391;
• Criminal penalties pursuant to A.R.S. § 11-
251.5; A.R.S. § 13-2311 (Fraudulent Schemes
and Practices); A.R.S. § 13-1201
(Endangerment); A.R.S. § 13-2407 (Tampering
with a Public Record); A.R.S. § 49-803(A)(1)
and 49-810 (Discharge of Used Oil to Sewers
without a Permit); and
• Recovery of civil damages, penalties and
costs to the POTW.
Civil Actions. The City has authority to file a
civil suit for violation of any Article of the
City’s SUO pursuant to A.R.S. § 49-391. A
civil action may be settled by Court judgment
or Consent Decree. Before a consent decree
filed with Superior Court becomes final, the
City shall provide a period of thirty (30) days
for public comment [A.R.S. § 49-391(C)].
Criminal Prosecution. The City of Douglas
Attorney has authority pursuant to A.R.S. § 11-
251.05 under State law for criminal prosecution
of Users who violate provisions of the
ordinance and other State laws. The City may
seek criminal prosecution when there is
evidence of willfulness, negligence, or bad
faith shown by the User for:
• Violations of the Ordinance;
• Violations of industrial wastewater
discharge permits (such as discharges in excess
of permit limits, or failure to submit selfmonitoring
reports);
• Violations of Orders for Corrective Actions
issued to implement pretreatment requirements
(such as orders to Cease Discharge or Show
Cause orders);
• Failure to notify the Control Authority of
unauthorized discharges (such as slug loads);
• Falsification of records; or
• Tampering with monitoring equipment.
Violations which continue for more than one
day shall be deemed separate and distinct
offenses for each day.
The EPA Guidance Document for Developing
Control Authority Enforcement Response Plans
suggests that “bad faith” is typically
demonstrated by a lack of cooperation and
incompleteness of corrective measures in a
timely manner.
2.4 Alternative Conflict Resolution
Conflicts can also be resolved by alternative
methods agreed upon by both the User and the
City on a case-by-case basis, as not to conflict
with State Statutes.
Examples of actions include the Pollution
Prevention School (PPS) used to educate
nonsignificant Users in lieu of assessing a
penalty, and negotiated settlement agreements.
2.4.A Pollution Prevention School (PPS)
Purpose: To educate Users in lieu of assessing
a pretreatment penalty, who for the first time
have one violation related to Sampling,
Monitoring, and Submission of Reports with
respect to their Industrial Wastewater
Discharge Permits and the Industrial
Wastewater Ordinance. PPS attendance may be
required when there is a violation of the
13.04.020
13-69 06/14/2017
pretreatment program and an option when a
new permit is issued.
Course Content: The class is approximately
four (4) hours in length. It covers the
background of the Clean Water Act and
NPDES/AZPDES program – Permits,
Wastewater Collection, Treatment and
Disposal in City of Douglas ; the way in which
Permits are written; Actions which the User
must take to comply with the Permit; available
exemptions; the Enforcement Response Plan
and the penalties for violations of a Permit; and
a discussion of the City of Douglas ’s SUO.
Notice: The User would be sent an NOV
advising them of the alternatives: (1) to go to
school; or (2) attend a Show Cause Meeting. A
fee for the course may be required.
2.4.B Negotiated Settlement Agreements
Purpose: As provided by State Statute (ARS §
49-391(c)), pretreatment programs may seek
compliance and recovery of civil penalties by a
negotiated settlement agreement. This process
is anticipated for Users who are in significant
noncompliance.
When to Use Agreements: Negotiated
Settlement Agreements are appropriate when
the User has not previously entered into an
administrative or civil consent decree or been
found liable in a State or Federal court for
similar violations. Pursuant to ARS § 49-
391(C), before a negotiated settlement becomes
final, the City shall provide a period of thirty
(30) days for public comment as provided in
Section 2.4.C below.
Penalty Amount: The proposed settlement will
be determined using the procedures of Setion 6,
considering the Penalty Evaluation List and the
Penalty Amounts sections.
2.4.C Supplemental Environmental Project
(SEP)
Introduction
The term Supplemental Environmental Project
(SEP) refers to a project that may serve in
addition to and in some cases in lieu of a
monetary penalty as the basis for the settlement
of an enforcement action.
In the settlement of a pretreatment violation,
the City may require the alleged violator to
achieve and maintain compliance with federal,
state and local pretreatment regulations and to
pay a civil penalty. To further the City’s goals
to protect and enhance public health and the
environment, one or more SEPs, may be
included in a settlement agreement.
The following is a statement of policy by which
the City will consider to accept an SEP as part
of or all of the settlement of an administrative
enforcement action. The City believes these
projects provide a useful environmental benefit
beyond what can be secured solely through
administrative orders.
Guidance for Discretion
The ultimate decision as to the settlement of an
administrative enforcement action rests with
the City of Douglas City Council. The policies
and procedures in this document are intended
for the guidance of the City.
Criteria for SEPs
A judgment as to the appropriateness of an SEP
in a particular action will generally be made in
accordance with the following criteria:
1. Benefit to the Environment from SEP
SEP’s will be allowed only when the City is
satisfied that an SEP will benefit the
environment or promote public health or safety.
2. Planned, Completed or Required Activities
An SEP may not be allowed for projects which
the Violator has initiated prior to discovery of
the violation.
Projects that have been committed to or started
before the identification of a violation or
13.04.020
13-70 06/14/2017
initiation of enforcement resolution discussions
may mitigate the penalty in other ways.
3. Relationship to Monetary Penalty
An SEP may not replace damages. A monetary
penalty may still be necessary in order to assure
that the City’s enforcement actions are
effective in deterring future violations by the
Violator or others in the regulated community.
Penalties maintain a level playing field by
ensuring that violators do not obtain an unfair
economic advantage over their competitors
who made the necessary expenditures to
comply. Penalties encourage companies to
adopt pollution prevention and recycling
techniques, so that they minimize their
pollutant discharges and reduce their potential
liabilities.
Under the following circumstances, the City
may allow an SEP constituting a 100%, dollarfor
dollar penalty offset:
1. The proposed SEP constitutes a pollution
prevention or pollution reduction/waste
minimization project;
2. The Violator’s compliance history does not
suggest a pattern of non- compliance with
environmental laws; or
3. When the Violator is an agency, board,
commission, council or department of the state,
a municipality, or a non-profit organization or
small business.
4. Available Only if Violations and Pollution
Corrected
An SEP may be considered only if violations
and all pollution created or threatened are fully
corrected and abated in a timely manner under
an enforceable agreement. A Compliance
Schedule timeline shall be no longer than five
years.
5. Relationship to Violation (“Nexus”
Requirement)
Generally, an SEP may be approved if the City
determines there is a direct relationship
between the nature of the violation(s) and the
environmental benefits to be derived from the
SEP. Alternatively, the City Council may
approve an SEP which, while lacking a direct
nexus to the violation, either furthers the City’s
statutory mission or reduces the likelihood of
future violations similar to those at issue. The
City prefers SEPs with a direct nexus. To
constitute a “direct nexus,” the SEP must:
1. Improve the environment injured by the
violation;
2. Reduce the total risk posed to public health
or the environment by the violation;
3. Result in the restoration of natural or manmade
environments from the actual or potential
damage resulting from the violation; or
4. Protect natural environments from actual or
potential damage resulting from the violation.
An “indirect nexus” may be consistent with this
policy if it substantially furthers the City’s
statutory mission or reduces the likelihood of
future violations similar to those at issue.
6. Initiation
The proposal to do an SEP may be initiated by
either the Violator or by the City. The burden
of developing the SEP and convincing the staff
of its benefits and likelihood of success are the
responsibility of the Violator. An SEP proposal
may be made at any time during an
enforcement action, although the City should
consider both the status of the action and the
resources that have been committed to it before
deciding whether to accept an SEP.
7. Compliance History
The Violator’s compliance history and capacity
to successfully and promptly complete the
project must be examined during evaluation of
a proposed SEP.
8. Compliance with SEP
13.04.020
13-71 06/14/2017
The Negotiated Settlement Agreement or
Consent Decree shall specify time- specific
milestones to be met in implementing the SEP,
including a completion date.
2.4.D ARS § 49-391(C) Public Notice
Public notice and comment will be provided
pursuant to the requirements of ARS § 49-
391(C) by the following:
(1) Notice by publication in the general
agenda of the City Council;
(2) Announcement by the Chairman at the
regular agenda meeting that public comment
will be received by the City for thirty (30) days
from the date of this announcement, on
settlements either administrative or civil.
Copies of the settlement and the enforcement
file shall be available for public review at
[insert location]
(3) At the City Councils regular agenda
Council meeting thirty (30) days subsequent to
the agenda item, or as soon thereafter as
possible, depending upon the Council’s
schedule, the City will report to the Council on
the public comments and recommend action to
be taken by the Council. If there are sufficient
requests from the public for a hearing and oral
testimony, the Council may grant a hearing and
take oral testimony.
(4) When a settlement is found to be
acceptable by the Council and the User, the
agreement will be finalized. Consent Decrees
will be filed with the State Superior Court and
negotiated settlement agreements will be filed
with the City.

responsibility of the City’s treatment works
which is to enforce all applicable pretreatment
requirements and standards as detailed in ARS
§ 49-391 and 40 CFR § 403.8(f)(1) and (2).
Section 5: Scheduling Criteria
Field Investigations are scheduled to meet
annual requirements, respond to emergency and
remedial actions, violations, and technical
problems, and to support permit modification.
Section 6: Penalty Policy
The City can propose to the City Council
acceptance of a monetary penalty to be
13.04.020
13-72 06/14/2017
included in a Negotiated Settlement Agreement
for violations of pretreatment standards or
requirements. Monetary penalties are intended
to recapture the full economic benefit of
noncompliance and to deter future violations.
6.1 When to Assess Penalties
Penalties are to be sought by the City Manager
or Director for any of the following reasons:
• Significant Noncompliance;
• Anytime there is pass-through, interference
or upset;
• Whenever the City is required to use
emergency authority; or
• For any other noncompliance for which the
City Manager or Director finds that the
recovery of civil damages, penalties, and costs
to the POTW are appropriate.
In determining the amount of a penalty, the
following items will be considered:
• The seriousness of the violation.
• The economic benefit, if any, resulting from
the violation.
• Any history of such violation.
• Any “good faith” efforts to comply with the
applicable requirements.
• The economic impact of the penalty on the
violator.
• Such other factors as justice may require.
6.2 Methods of Assessing Penalties
A.R.S. § 49-391 provides for the enforcement
of this Ordinance by imposition and recovery
of a penalty of not more than $25,000 for each
violation. For continuing violations, each day
shall constitute a separate offense.
6.3 Penalty Amount(s)
The City shall seek the following penalties. It is
the City’s policy to seek the maximum penalty
available in a court action if not otherwise
resolved in settlement pursuant to this policy.
The City Manager or Director has the
discretion to seek a lesser penalty based on
industrial user compliance history and
accentuating circumstances. The City Manager
or Director may also require that an imposed
penalty be applied to purchase and install
corrective action equipment or allow a SEP
(see section 2.4.C).

Section 7: Enforcement Response Guide
The Enforcement Response Guide, adopted by
City of Douglas, is the standard EPA
configuration. It is intended as a “snapshot” or
quick overview of the enforcement process.
Instructions for using the detailed guidance
precede the Guide. Stepping through the
Enforcement Response Guide, according to the
directions, will allow the
User to arrive at a projected course of action
under “standard conditions.” However, only a
small percentage of actual enforcement cases
follow “standard conditions;” therefore, the
City will still evaluate on a case-by-case basis
the most appropriate enforcement course of
action.
7.1 Description of Terms
Terms and abbreviations used in the
Enforcement Response Guide are defined
below. Specific enforcement responses are
described in greater detail in Section 7.3.

7.2 Instructions for using the Enforcement
Response Guide
(1) Locate the type of noncompliance in the
first column.
(2) Using the second column, identify the
most accurate description of the nature of the
violation.
(3) City staff will assess the appropriateness
of the recommended response(s) in the third
column. First offenders or those demonstrating
13.04.020
13-74 06/14/2017
good faith may merit a more lenient response.
Similarly, repeat offenders or those
demonstrating willful conduct may require a
more stringent response. The City may want to
use what would normally be reserved as a
follow-up response as the initial action for
more serious circumstances.
(4) Document the rationale for selecting the
particular enforcement response.
(5) Apply the enforcement response to the
Industrial User. Specify corrective action or
response required from the User.
(6) Document User responses and resolution
of noncompliance.
(7) Follow up with escalated enforcement
action if the User response is not received or if
violations continue.

7.4 Timeframes for Responses
A. Violations shall be identified and
documented within five days of receiving
compliance information.
B. Initial enforcement responses involving
contact with the User and requesting
information on corrective or preventative
action(s) shall occur within 30 days of the
City’s knowledge of a violation.
C. Violations which threaten health, property,
or environmental quality are considered
emergencies and will receive immediate
responses (not to exceed 24 hours), such as
halting the discharge or terminating services.
D. Follow-up compliance activities shall begin
no later than 45 days after the initial
enforcement action is taken.
E. When follow-up compliance actions indicate
that a violation persists or that satisfactory
progress is not being made, enforcement shall
be escalated within 90 days of the initial
enforcement action. (Ord. 17-1070 § 1, 2017).
The key elements of the ERP meet the
requirements of Federal regulations at 40 CFR
403.8(f)(5):
• Describe how the POTW will investigate
instances of noncompliance;
• Describe the types of escalating enforcement
responses the POTW will take in response to
all anticipated types of industrial user
violations and the time periods within which
responses will take place;
• Identify (by title) the official(s) responsible
for each type of response; and
• Adequately reflect the POTW’s primary
responsibility to enforce all applicable
pretreatment requirements and standards, as
detailed in 40 CFR § 403.8(f) (1) and (2).
Food Service Establishments (FSEs) within the
City of Douglas service area are subject to the
FSE Enforcement Response Guide (FSE-ERG)
which exists as a separate document. The FSEERG
ensures a consistent response to all food
service establishments that cause, or have the
potential to cause, interference, obstruction,
sanitary sewer overflows, bypasses, or storm
water inflow to the City sanitary sewer
collection system and wastewater treatment
plants. FSEs are nondomestic users and are
monitored by the City under its Fats, Oils and
Grease (FOG) Control Program. This FSEERG
is intended to be used for food service
establishments and users that contribute FOG
to the City’s sanitary sewer system. Refer to
the City’s SUO and FOG Management Policy
for additional information on the City’s FOG
control program.
Section 13.07.010 Methods to
Investigate Noncompliance.
Methods used by the POTW to investigate the
compliance status of the Industrial User (User)
include but are not limited to, the following:
1.1 Field Inspections. Field Inspection is an
on-site presence of trained personnel to gather
data for immediate fact determination or
evaluation of compliance. The types of data
gathered include documents, statements, and
observations. Physical evidence and
information may also be collected as evidence
that may lead to enforcement.
1.2 Surveillance Sampling. Surveillance
sampling is performed by obtaining a
representative sample of a discharged
13.04.020
13-84 12/14/2011
substance in accordance with regulatory
requirements. Typically, surveillance samples
of discharge from User operations are taken by
Pretreatment personnel.
1.3 Document Review. Document review
includes the analysis of data that relates to the
compliance status of a User, such as User
correspondence, Self-Monitoring Report
Forms, and Baseline Monitoring Reports.
1.4 Meetings. Meetings, both formal and
informal, with a User are utilized to obtain and
share information which relates to any aspect
of the Pretreatment Program. Meetings may be
used to investigate technical issues (laboratory
analysis, sampling procedures/locations,
application of regulations, etc.) or concerns
about the compliance status of a User, or to
gather facts concerning alleged violations.
1.5 Increased Monitoring. Increased
monitoring by submission of samples and/or
records may be required of the User to provide
further data to demonstrate the compliance
status.
1.6 Technical Evaluation/Research. In
making the determination of a User’s
compliance status when substantial technical
considerations exist, an evaluation of the best
available scientific and technical information
will be made. This evaluation may include the
assistance of technical resource people,
industrial or regulatory subject matter experts,
or documents from research, pilot studies, etc.
1.7 Interaction with other Agencies. Review
of local and State files, communication with the
State and local Departments of Environmental
Quality, the Southern Arizona Environmental
Crimes Task Force, and the City’s Attorney’s
Office, is utilized to further investigate the
compliance status.
1.8 Other Methods. Other methods to
establish the compliance status may be used as
the need arises on a case-by-case basis.

eliminates the need for a Capital Facility
that would have otherwise have been
needed in the immediate area of the EDU
to maintain the City’s Level of Service.
Dwelling Unit: A house, apartment, mobile
home or trailer, group of rooms, or single
room occupied as separate living quarters
or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as
separate living quarters.

development within a particular Category
of Development, defined in terms of a
standardized measure of the demand that a
unit of development in that Category of
Development generates for Necessary
Public Services in relation to the demand
generated by a detached single-family
Dwelling Unit. For all Categories of
Necessary Public Services, the EDU factor
for a detached single-family Dwelling Unit
is one (1), while the EDU factor for a unit
of development within another Category of
Development is represented as a ratio of
the demand for each Category of Necessary
Public Services typically generated by that
unit as compared to the demand for such
services typically generated by a detached
single-family Dwelling Unit. An EDU

per EDU basis as defined and calculated in
the Infrastructure Improvements Plan,
including all required Offsets, and shall
recommend a development impact fee
structure for adoption by the City. The
actual impact fees to be assessed shall be
disclosed and adopted in the form of
impact fee schedules described in
Appendix A to this Chapter.
C. Carry-over of Previously-Established
Development Impact Fees and
Grandfathered Facilities. Notwithstanding
the requirements of this Chapter, certain
development impact fees adopted by the

1. Until August 1, 2014 or the date a new
development impact fee is adopted for the
applicable Category of Necessary Public
Services in a Service Area pursuant to this
Chapter, whichever occurs first,
development impact fees established prior
to January 1, 2012 shall continue in full
force and effect to the extent that the
development impact fee is used to provide
a Category of Necessary Public Services
that is authorized by Section X-8 of this
Chapter. Development impact fees
collected prior to January 1, 2012, shall be
expended on Capital Facilities within the

by the City to provide a Capital Facility.
ii. The applicable Capital Facility was
included in the City’s Infrastructure
Improvements Plan, or other City planning
document prepared pursuant to applicable
law, prior to June 1, 2011.
Before August 1, 2014, the City uses the
development impact fee to finance a Capital
Facility in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05,
Subsection (S).
3. Defined terms in any previously
established fee schedule shall be
interpreted according to the ordinance in

Sec. X-7. – Land Use Assumptions
The Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall
be consistent with the City’s current Land
Use Assumptions for each Service Area
and each Category of Necessary Public
Services as adopted by the City pursuant to
A.R.S. § 463.05.
A. Reviewing the Land Use Assumptions.
Prior to the adoption or amendment of an
Infrastructure Improvements Plan, the City
shall review and evaluate the Land Use
Assumptions on which the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan is to be based to ensure
that the Land Use Assumptions within each
Service Area conform with the General
Plan.
B. Evaluating Necessary Changes. If the
Land Use Assumptions upon which an
Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based
13.08.010
13-97 12/14/2011
have not been updated within the last five
years, the City shall evaluate the Land Use
Assumptions to determine whether changes
are necessary. If, after general evaluation,
the City determines that the Land Use
Assumptions are still valid, the City shall
issue the report required in Section X-10 of
this Chapter.
C. Required Modifications to Land Use
Assumptions. If the City determines that
changes to the Land Use Assumptions are
necessary in order to adopt or amend an
Infrastructure Improvements Plan, it shall
make such changes as necessary to the
Land Use Assumptions prior to or in
conjunction with the review and approval
of the Infrastructure Improvements Plan
pursuant to Section X-10 of this Chapter.
Sec. X-8. – Infrastructure Improvements
Plan
A. Infrastructure Improvements Plan
Contents. The Infrastructure Improvements
Plan shall be developed by Qualified
Professionals and may be based upon or
incorporated within the City’s Capital
Improvements Plan. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall:
1. Specify the Categories of Necessary
Public Services for which the City will
impose a development impact fee, which
may include any or all of the following:
a. Water
b. Wastewater
c. Stormwater, Drainage, and Flood
Control
d. Libraries
e. Street Facilities
f. Fire Protection
g. Police
h. Parks
2. Define and provide a map of one or more
Service Areas within which the City will
provide each Category of Necessary Public
Services for which development impact
fees will be charged. Each Service Area
must be defined in a manner that
demonstrates a Substantial Nexus between
the Capital Facilities to be provided in the
Service Area and the EDUs to be served by
those Capital Facilities. For Libraries and
for Parks larger than 30 acres, each Service
Area must be defined in a manner that
demonstrates a Direct Benefit between the
Capital Facilities and the EDUs to be
served by those Capital Facilities. The City
may cover more than one category of
Capital Facilities in the same Service Area
provided that there is an independent
Substantial Nexus or Direct Benefit, as
applicable, between each Category of
Necessary Public Services and the EDUs to
be served.
3. Identify and describe the Land Use
Assumptions upon which the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan is based in each
Service Area.
4. Analyze and identify the existing Level
of Service provided by the City to existing
EDUs for each Category of Necessary
Public Services in each Service Area.
5. Identify the Level of Service to be
provided by the City for each Category of
Necessary Public Services in each Service
Area based on the relevant Land Use
Assumptions and any established City
standards or policies related to required
Levels of Service. If the City provides the
13.08.010
13-98 12/14/2011
same Category of Necessary Public
Services in more than one Service Area, the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall
include a comparison of the Levels of
Service to be provided in each Service
Area.
6. For each Category of Necessary Public
Services, analyze and identify the existing
capacity of the Capital Facilities in each
Service Area, the utilization of those
Capital Facilities by existing EDUs, and
the available excess capacity of those
Capital Facilities to serve new EDUs
including any existing or planned
commitments or agreements for the usage
of such capacity. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall additionally
identify: (a) any changes or upgrades to
existing Capital Facilities that will be
needed to achieve or maintain the planned
Level of Service to existing EDUs, or to
meet new safety, efficiency, environmental,
or other regulatory requirements for
services provided to existing EDUs; and (b)
those portions of Capital Facilities that will
be necessary to serve any new City facility
for which development impact fees will not
be assessed.
7. Identify any Grandfathered Facilities and
the impact thereof on the need for
Necessary Public Services in each affected
Service Area.
8. Estimate the total number of existing and
future EDUs within each Service Area
based on the City’s Land Use Assumptions
and projected new EDUs in each Service
Area.
9. Based on the analysis in paragraphs (3)-
(6) above, provide a summary table or
tables describing the Level of Service for
each Category of Necessary Public
Services by relating the required Capital
Facilities to EDUs in each Service Area,
and identifying the applicable EDU factor
associated with each Category of
Development.
10. For each Category of Necessary Public
Services, analyze and identify the projected
utilization of any available excess capacity
in existing Capital Facilities, and all new or
expanded Capital Facilities that will be
required to provide and maintain the
planned Level of Service in each Service
Area as a result of the new projected EDUs
in that Service Area, for a period not to
exceed ten years. Nothing in this
Subsection shall prohibit the City from
additionally including in its Infrastructure
Improvements Plan projected utilization of,
or needs for, Capital Facilities for a period
longer than ten years, provided that the
costs of such Capital Facilities are excluded
from the calculation of the Plan-Based Cost
per EDU.
11. For each Category of Necessary Public
Services, estimate the total cost of any
available excess capacity and/or new or
expanded Capital Facilities that will be
required to serve new EDUs, including
costs of land acquisition, improvements,
engineering and architectural services,
studies leading to design, design,
construction, financing, and administrative
costs, as well as projected costs of
inflation. Such total costs shall not include
costs for ongoing operation and
maintenance of Capital Facilities, nor for
13.08.010
13-99 12/14/2011
replacement of Capital Facilities to the
extent that such replacement is necessary to
serve existing EDUs. If the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan includes changes or
upgrades to existing Capital Facilities that
will be needed to achieve or maintain the
planned Level of Service to existing EDUs,
or to meet new regulatory requirements for
services provided to existing EDUs, such
costs shall be identified and distinguished
in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan.
12. Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees,
assessments or other sources that will be
available to fund the new or expanded
Capital Facilities identified in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which
shall include estimated state-shared
revenue, highway users revenue, federal
revenue, ad valorem property taxes,
construction contracting or similar excise
taxes and the capital recovery portion of
utility fees attributable to development
based on the approved land use
assumptions. The Infrastructure
Improvements Plan shall additionally
estimate the time required to finance,
construct and implement the new or
expanded Capital Facilities.
13. Calculate required Offsets as follows:
a. From the forecasted revenues in
Subsection (12) of this Section, identify
those sources of revenue that: (i) are
attributable to new development, and (ii)
will contribute to paying for the capital
costs of Necessary Public Services.
b. For each source and amount of revenue
identified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
Subsection, calculate the relative
contribution of each Category of
Development to paying for the capital costs
of Necessary Public Services in each
Service Area.
c. Based on the relative contributions
identified pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
subsection, for each Category of Necessary
Public Services, calculate the total Offset to
be provided to each Category of
Development in each Service Area.
d. For each Category of Necessary Public
Services, convert the total Offset to be
provided to each Category of Development
in each Service Area into an offset amount
per EDU by dividing the total Offset for
each Category of Development by the
number of EDUs associated with that
Category of Development.
e. Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes
of calculating the required Offset, if the
City imposes a construction, contracting, or
similar excise tax rate in excess of the
percentage amount of the transaction
privilege tax rate that is imposed on the
majority of other transaction privilege tax
classifications in the City, the entire excess
portion of the construction, contracting, or
similar excise tax shall be treated as a
contribution to the capital costs of
Necessary Public Services provided to new
development unless the excess portion is
already utilized for such purpose pursuant
to this Section.
f. In determining the amount of required
Offset for land included in a community
facilities district established under A.R.S.
Title 48, Chapter 4, Article 6, the City shall
take into account any Capital Facilities
provided by the district that are included in
the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
13.08.010
13-100 12/14/2011
the capital costs paid by the district for
such Capital Facilities, and shall offset
impact fees assessed within the community
facilities district proportionally.
14. Calculate the Plan-Based Cost per EDU
by:
a. Dividing the total projected costs to
provide Capital Facilities to new EDUs for
each Category of Necessary Public
Services in each Service Area as
determined pursuant to Subsection (9) of
this Section into the number of new EDUs
projected for that Service Area over a
period not to exceed ten years, considering
the specific EDU factor(s) associated with
such EDUs for each Category of Necessary
Public Services.
b. Subtracting the required Offset per EDU
calculated pursuant to Subsection (11) of
this Section.
B. Multiple Plans. An Infrastructure
Improvements Plan adopted pursuant to
this Subsection may address one or more of
the City’s Categories of Necessary Public
Services in any or all of the City’s Service
Areas. Each Capital Facility shall be
subject to no more than one Infrastructure
Improvements Plan at any given time.
C. Reserved Capacity. The City may
reserve capacity in an Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to serve one or more
planned future developments, including
capacity reserved through a Development
Agreement pursuant to Section X-13 of this
Chapter. All reservations of existing
capacity must be disclosed in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the
time it is adopted.
X-9. – Adoption and Modification
Procedures
A. Adopting or Amending the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan. The
Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall be
adopted or amended subject to the

2. The notice shall identify the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and Fee Report that shall
continue in force without amendment.
3. The notice shall provide a map and
description of the Service Area(s) covered by
such Infrastructure Improvements Plan and
Fee Report.
4. The notice shall identify an address to
which any resident of the City may submit,

Section.
Sec. X-11. - Collection of Development
Impact Fees
A. Collection. Development impact
fees, together with administrative charges
assessed pursuant to Paragraph (A)(6) of
this Section, shall be calculated and
collected prior to issuance of permission to
commence development; specifically:
1. Unless otherwise specified pursuant
to a Development Agreement adopted
pursuant to Section X-13 of this Chapter,
development impact fees shall be paid prior
to issuance of a building permit according
to the current development impact fee
schedule for the applicable Service Area(s)
as adopted pursuant to this Chapter, or
according to any other development impact
fee schedule as authorized in this Chapter.
2. If a building permit is not required for
the development, but water or wastewater
connections are required, any and all
development impact fees due shall be paid
at the time the water service connection is
purchased. If only a wastewater connection
is required, the development impact fees
shall be paid prior to approval of a
connection to the sewer system.
Wastewater development impact fees shall
be assessed if a development connects to
the public sewer, or as determined by the
13.08.010
13-103 12/14/2011
City’s Public Works Director, is capable of
discharging sewage to a City public sewer.
3. If the development is located in a
Service Area with a Stormwater, Drainage,
and Flood Control development impact fee,
and neither a building permit, water, or
sewer service connection is required, the
Storm Drainage development impact fee
due shall be paid at the time a civil or site
permit is issued for the development.
4. No building permit, water or sewer
connection, or certificate of occupancy
shall be issued if a development impact fee
is not paid as directed in the previous
paragraphs.
5. If the building permit is for a change in
the type of building use, an increase in
square footage, a change to land use, or an
addition to a residential or non-residential
point of demand to the water or wastewater
system, the development impact fee shall
be assessed on the additional service units
resulting from the expansion or change,
and following the development impact fee
schedule applicable to any new use type.
6. For issued permits that expire or are
voided, development impact fees and
administrative charges shall be as follows:
a. If the original permittee is seeking to
renew an expired or voided permit, and the
development impact fees paid for such
development have not been refunded, then
the permittee shall pay the difference
between any development impact fees paid
at the time the permit was issued and those
in the fee schedule at the time the permit is
reissued or renewed.
b. If a new or renewed permit for the same
development is being sought by someone
other than the original permittee, the new
permit Applicant shall pay the full
development impact fees specified in the
fee schedule in effect at the time that the
permits are reissued or renewed. If the
original permittee has assigned its rights
under the permits to the new permit
Applicant, the new permit Applicant shall
pay development impact fees as if it were
the original permittee.
B. Exceptions. Development impact fees
shall not be owed under either of the
following conditions:
1. Development impact fees have been paid
for the development and the permit(s)
which triggered the collection of the
development impact fees have not expired
or been voided.
2. The approval(s) that trigger the
collection of development impact fees
involve modifications to existing
residential or non-residential development
that do not: (a) add new EDUs, (b) increase
the impact of existing EDUs on existing or
future Capital Facilities, or (c) change the
land-use type of the existing development
to a different category of development for
which a higher development impact fee
would have been due. To the extent that
any modification does not meet the
requirements of this paragraph, the
development impact fee due shall be the
difference between the development impact
fee that was or would have been due on the
existing development and the development
13.08.010
13-104 12/14/2011
impact fee that is due on the development
as modified.
C. Temporary Exemptions from
Development Impact Fee Schedules. New
developments in the City shall be
temporarily exempt from increases in
development impact fees that result from
the adoption of new or modified
development impact fee schedules as
follows:
1. Residential Uses. On or after the day that
the first building permit is issued for a
single-family residential development, the
City shall, at the permittee’s request,
provide the permittee with an applicable
development impact fee schedule that shall
be in force for a period of 24 months
beginning on the day that the first building
permit is issued, and which shall expire at
the end of the first business day of the 25th
month thereafter. During the effective
period of the applicable development
impact fee schedule, any building permit
issued for the same single-family
residential development shall not be subject
to any new or modified development
impact fee schedule.
2. Commercial, Industrial and Multifamily
Uses. On or after the day that the final
approval, as defined in A.R.S. 9-
463.05(T)(4), is issued for a commercial,
industrial or multifamily development, the
City shall provide an applicable
development impact fee schedule that shall
be in force for a period of 24 months
beginning on the day that final
development approval of a site plan or final
subdivision plat is given, and which shall
expire at the end of the first business day of
the 25th month thereafter. During the
effective period of the applicable
development impact fee schedule, any
building permit issued for the same
development shall not be subject to any
new or modified development impact fee
schedule.
3. Other Development. Any Category of
Development not covered under paragraphs
1 and 2 of this Subsection shall pay
development impact fees according to the
fee schedule that is current at the time of
collection as specified in Subsection (A) of
this Section.
4. Changes to Site Plans and Subdivision
Plats. Notwithstanding the other
requirements of this Subsection, if changes
are made to a development’s final site plan
or subdivision plat that will increase the
number of service units after the issuance
of a grandfathered development impact fee
schedule, the City may assess any new or
modified development impact fees against
the additional service units. If the City
reduces the amount of an applicable
development impact fee during the period
that a grandfathered development impact
fee schedule is in force, the City shall
assess the lower development impact fee.
D. Option to Pursue Special Fee
Determination. Where a development is of
a type that does not closely fit within a
particular Category of Development
appearing on an adopted development
impact fee schedule, or where a
development has unique characteristics
such that the actual burdens and costs
associated with providing Necessary Public
Services to that development will differ
13.08.010
13-105 12/14/2011
substantially from that associated with
other developments in a specified Category
of Development, the City may require the
Applicant to provide the City Public Works
Director or authorized designee with an
alternative development impact fee
analysis. Based on a projection of the
actual burdens and costs that will be
associated with the development, the
alternative development impact fee analysis
may propose a unique fee for the
development based on the application of an
appropriate EDU factor to the applicable
Plan-Based Cost per EDU, or may propose
that the development be covered under the
development impact fee schedule
governing a different and more analogous
Category of Development. The City Public
Works Director or authorized designee
shall review the alternative impact fee
analysis and shall make a determination as
to the development impact fee to be
charged. Such decision shall be appealable
pursuant to Section X-14 of this Chapter.
The City Public Works Director or
authorized designee may require the
Applicant to pay an administrative fee to
cover the actual costs of reviewing the
special fee determination application.
Sec. X-12. - Development Impact Fee
Credits and Credit Agreements
A. Eligibility of Capital Facility. All
development impact fee Credits must meet
the following requirements:
1. One of the following is true:
a. The Capital Facility, or the financial
contribution toward a Capital Facility that
will be provided by the developer and for
which a Credit will be issued, must be
identified in an adopted Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and Fee Report as a
Capital Facility for which a development
impact fee was assessed; or
b. The Applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City that, given the class
and type of improvement, the subject
Capital Facility should have been included
in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in
lieu of a different Capital Facility that was
included in the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan and for which a
development impact fee was assessed. If
the subject Capital Facility is determined to
be eligible for a Credit in this manner, the
City shall amend the Infrastructure
Improvements Plan to (i) include the
subject replacement facility and (ii) delete
the Capital Facility that will be replaced.
2. Credits shall not be available for any
infrastructure provided by a developer if
the cost of such infrastructure will be
repaid to the developer by the City through
another agreement or mechanism. To the
extent that the developer will be paid or
reimbursed by the City for any
contribution, payment, construction, or
dedication from any City funding source
including an agreement to reimburse the
developer with future collected
development impact fees pursuant to
Section X-13 of this Chapter, any Credits
claimed by the developer shall be: (a)
deducted from any amounts to be paid or
reimbursed by the City; or (b) reduced by
the amount of such payment or
reimbursement.
13.08.010
13-106 12/14/2011
B. Eligibility of Subject Development. To
be eligible for a Credit, the Subject
Development must be located within the
Service Area of the eligible Capital
Facility.
C. Calculation of Credits. Credits will be
based on that portion of the costs for an
eligible Capital Facility identified in the
adopted Infrastructure Improvements Plan
for which a development fee was assessed
pursuant to the Fee Report. If the Gross
Impact Fee for a particular category of
Necessary Public Service is adopted at an
amount lower than the Plan-Based Cost per
EDU, the amount of any Credit shall be
reduced in proportion to the difference
between the Plan-Based Cost per EDU and
the Gross Impact Fee adopted. A Credit
shall not exceed the actual costs the
Applicant incurred in providing the eligible
Capital Facility.
D. Allocation of Credits. Before any Credit
can be issued to a Subject Development (or
portion thereof), the Credit must be
allocated to that development as follows:
1. The Developer and the City must
execute a Credit Agreement including all of
the following:
a. The total amount of the Credits resulting
from provision of an eligible Capital
Facility.
b. The estimated number of EDUs to be
served within the Subject Development.
c. The method by which the Credit values
will be distributed within the Subject
Development.
2. It is the responsibility of the developer to
request allocation of development impact
fee Credits through an application for a
Credit Agreement (which may be part of a
Development Agreement entered into
pursuant to Section X-13 of this Chapter).
3. If a building permit is issued or a
water/sewer connection is purchased, and a
development impact fee is paid prior to
execution of a Credit Agreement for the
Subject Development, no Credits may be
allocated retroactively to that permit or
connection. Credits may be allocated to
any remaining permits for the Subject
Development in accordance with this
Chapter.
4. If the entity that provides an eligible
Capital Facility sells or relinquishes a
development (or portion thereof) that it
owns or controls prior to execution of a
Credit Agreement or Development
Agreement, Credits resulting from the
eligible Capital Facility will only be
allocated to the development if the entity
legally assigns such rights and
responsibilities to its successor(s) in
interest for the Subject Development.
5. If multiple entities jointly provide an
eligible Capital Facility, both entities must
enter into a single Credit Agreement with
the City, and any request for the allocation
of Credit within the Subject
Development(s) must be made jointly by
the entities that provided the eligible
Capital Facility.
6. Credits may only be reallocated from or
within a Subject Development with the
13.08.010
13-107 12/14/2011
City’s approval of an amendment to an
executed Credit Agreement, subject to the
following conditions:
a. The entity that executed the original
agreement with the City, or its legal
successor in interest and the entity that
currently controls the Subject Development
are parties to the request for reallocation.
b. The reallocation proposal does not
change the value of any Credits already
issued for the Subject Development.
7. A Credit Agreement may authorize the
allocation of Credits to a non-contiguous
parcel only if all of the following
conditions are met:
a. The entity that executed the original
agreement with the City or its legal
successor in interest, the entity that
currently controls the Subject
Development, and the entity that controls
the non-contiguous parcel are parties to the
request for reallocation.
b. The reallocation proposal does not
change the value of any Credits already
issued for the Subject Development.
c. The non-contiguous parcel is in the same
Service Area as that served by the eligible
Capital Facility.
d. The non-contiguous parcel receives a
Necessary Public Service from the eligible
Capital Facility.
e. The Credit Agreement specifically states
the value of the Credits to be allocated to
each parcel and/or EDU, or establishes a
mechanism for future determination of the
Credit values.
f. The Credit Agreement does not involve
the transfer of Credits to or from any
property subject to a Development
Agreement.
E. Credit Agreement. Credits shall only be
issued pursuant to a Credit Agreement
executed in accordance with Subsection D
of this Section. The City Manager or
Authorized Designee is authorized by this
Chapter to enter into a Credit Agreement
with the controlling entity of a Subject
Development, subject to the following:
1. The Developer requesting the Credit
Agreement shall provide all information
requested by the City to allow it to
determine the value of the Credit to be
applied.
2. An application for a Credit Agreement
shall be submitted to the City by the
Developer within one year of the date on
which ownership or control of the Capital
Facility passes to the City.
3. The Developer shall submit a draft
Credit Agreement to the City Manager or
authorized designee(s) for review in the
form provided to the Applicant by the City.
The draft Credit Agreement shall include,
at a minimum, all of the following
information and supporting documentation:
a. A legal description and map depicting
the location of the Subject Development for
which Credit is being applied. The map
shall depict the location of the Capital
13.08.010
13-108 12/14/2011
Facilities that have been or will be
provided.
b. An estimate of the total EDUs that will
be developed within the Subject
Development depicted on the map and
described in the legal description.
c. A list of the Capital Facilities, associated
physical attributes, and the related costs as
stated in the Infrastructure Improvements
Plan.
d. Documentation showing the date(s) of
acceptance by the City, if the Capital
Facilities have already been provided.
e. The total amount of Credit to be applied
within the Subject Development and the
calculations leading to the total amount of
Credit.
f. The Credit amount to be applied to each
EDU within the Subject Development for
each Category of Necessary Public
Services.
4. The Credit Agreement shall be approved
by the City Council prior to its execution.
The City’s determination of the Credit to
be allocated is final.
5. Upon execution of the Credit Agreement
by the City and the Applicant, Credits shall
be deemed allocated to the Subject
Development.
6. Any amendment to a previously
approved Credit Agreement must be
initiated within two years of the City’s final
acceptance of the eligible Capital Facility
for which the amendment is requested.
7. Any Credit Agreement approved as part
of a Development Agreement shall be
amended in accordance with the terms of
the Development Agreement and Section
X-13 of this Chapter.
F. Issuance of Credits. Credits allocated
pursuant to Subsection (D) of this Section
may be issued and applied toward the
Gross Impact Fees due from a
development, subject to the following
conditions:
1. Credits issued for an eligible Capital
Facility may only be applied to the
development impact fee due for the
applicable Category of Necessary Public
Services, and may not be applied to any fee
due for another Category of Necessary
Public Services.
2. Credits shall only be issued when the
eligible Capital Facility from which the
Credits were derived has been accepted by
the City or when adequate security for the
completion of the eligible Capital Facility
has been provided in accordance with all
terms of an executed Development
Agreement.
3. Where Credits have been issued pursuant
to paragraph (2) of this Subsection, an
impact fee due at the time a building permit
is issued shall be reduced by the Credit
amount stated in or calculated from the
executed Credit Agreement. Where Credits
have not yet been issued, the Gross Impact
Fee shall be paid in full, and a refund of the
Credit amount shall be due when the
Developer demonstrates compliance with
13.08.010
13-109 12/14/2011
Paragraph (2) of this Subsection in a
written request to the City.
4. Credits, once issued, may not be
rescinded or reallocated to another permit
or parcel, except that Credits may be
released for reuse on the same Subject
Development if a building permit for which
the Credits were issued has expired or been
voided and is otherwise eligible for a
refund under Section X-15(A)(2)(a) of this
Chapter.
5. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Section X-12, Credits issued prior to
January 1, 2012 may only be used for the
Subject Development for which they were
issued. Such Credits may be transferred to
a new owner of all or part of the Subject
Development in proportion to the
percentage of ownership in the Subject
Development to be held by the new owner.
Sec. X-13. - Development Agreements
Development Agreements containing
provisions regarding development impact
fees, development impact fee Credits,
and/or disbursement of revenues from
development impact fee accounts shall

500.05 and any applicable requirements of
the City Code. Except where specifically
modified by this Section, all provisions of
Section X-12 of this Chapter shall apply to
any Credit Agreement that is authorized as
part of a Development Agreement.
C. Early Credit Issuance. A Development
Agreement may authorize the issuance of
Credits prior to acceptance of an eligible

Development Agreement specifically states
the form and value of the security (i.e.
bond, letter of Credit, etc.) to be provided
to the City prior to issuance of any Credits.
The City shall determine the acceptable
form and value of the security to be
provided.
D. Non-Contiguous Credit Allocation. A

this Section.
Sec. X-14. - Appeals
A development impact fee determination
by City staff may be appealed in
accordance with the following procedures:

Sec. X-15. – Refunds of Development
Impact Fees
A. Refunds. A refund (or partial
refund) will be paid to any current owner of
property within the City who submits a
written request to the City and
demonstrates that:
1. The permit(s) that triggered the
collection of the development impact fee
have expired or been voided prior to the
commencement of the development for
which the permits were issued and the
development impact fees collected have not
been expended, encumbered, or Pledged
for the repayment of Financing or Debt; or
2. The owner of the subject real property or
its predecessor in interest paid a
development impact fee for the applicable
Capital Facility on or after August 1, 2014,
and one of the following conditions exists:
a. The Capital Facility designed to serve
the subject real property has been
constructed, has the capacity to serve the
subject real property and any development
for which there is reserved capacity, and
the service which was to be provided by
that Capital Facility has not been provided
to the subject real property from that
Capital Facility or from any other
infrastructure.
b. After collecting the fee to construct a
Capital Facility the City fails to complete
construction of the Capital Facility within the
time period identified in the Infrastructure
13.08.010
13-112 12/14/2011
Improvements Plan, as it may be amended,
and the corresponding service is otherwise
unavailable to the subject real property from
that Capital Facility or any other
infrastructure.
c. For a Category of Necessary Public
Services other than Water or Wastewater
Facilities, any part of a development impact
fee is not spent within ten years of the City’s
receipt of the development impact fee.
d. Any part of a development impact fee for
Water or Wastewater Facilities is not spent
within 15 years of the City’s receipt of the
development impact fee.
e. The development impact fee was
calculated and collected for the construction
cost to provide all or a portion of a specific
Capital Facility serving the subject real
property and the actual construction costs for
the Capital Facility are less than the
construction costs projected in the
Infrastructure Improvements Plan by a factor
of 10% or more. In such event, the current
owner of the subject real property shall, upon
request as set forth in this Section A, be
entitled to a refund for the difference between
the amounts of the development impact fee
charged for and attributable to such
construction cost and the amount the
development impact fee would have been
calculated to be if the actual construction cost
had been included in the Fee Report. The
refund contemplated by this Subsection shall
relate only to the costs specific to the
construction of the applicable Capital Facility
and shall not include any related design,
administrative, or other costs not directly
incurred for construction of the Capital
Facility that are included in the development
impact fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-
463.05.
B. Earned Interest. A refund of a development
impact fee shall include any interest actually
earned on the refunded portion of the
development impact fee by the City from the
date of collection to the date of refund. All
refunds shall be made to the record owner of
the property at the time the refund is paid.

dollars shall be assessed against an account
each time water service is disconnected by the
city for failure to pay all due and delinquent

some other location. The City may continue to
pursue all available means to collect the
outstanding arrearages from the delinquent
account holder For residential property of four

or other conditions which the Public Works
Director determines makes it unreasonable or
dangerous to restore service to the premises
until those conditions are corrected by the
owner.
G. Damage to Meters. If a water meter is

other than normal wear and tear, the reasonable
cost of repairing or replacing the meter shall be

It is the purpose of this chapter:
A. To protect the public water supply
served by the city water department from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by
isolating, within its customers internal
distribution system, such contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow or backsiphon
into the city’s water distribution system;
B. To promote the elimination or control of
existing cross-connections, actual or potential,
between its customers in-plant potable water
system and nonpotable systems; and
C. To provide for the maintenance of a
continuing program of backflow prevention
and cross-connection control which will
effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of all potable water systems by crossconnection.
(Ord. 626 § 1, 1993)
13.12.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter:
A. “Approved backflow prevention
assembly” means a backflow prevention
assembly of the size and type approved by the
water and sewer department, that has
completely met the laboratory and field
performance specifications of the Foundation
for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic
Research of the University of Southern
California as are published from time to time
and, where on a fire system, has Underwriters
Laboratory and Factory Mutual approval, or as
otherwise described, limited or provided in
Section 13.12.100 of this chapter.
B. “Auxiliary water supply” means any
water supply on or available to the premises
other than the city’s approved public water
system. These auxiliary waters may include
“used water” or “industrial fluid.”
C. “Backflow” means the reversal of the
flow of water or mixture of water and other
liquids, gases or other substances into any part
of the city’s water distribution system.
D. “Backflow prevention assembly” or
“assembly” means a device or means designed
to prevent backflow and includes:
1. Air-Gap. The unobstructed vertical
distance through the free atmosphere between
the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or
13.12.020
13-121
other device and the flood level rim of the
vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least
double the diameter of the supply pipe,
measured vertically, above the top of the
overflow rim of the vessel, and, in no case less
than one inch.
2. Reduced Pressure Principle Assembly.
An assembly of two independently operating
approved check valves with an automatically
operating differential relief valve between the
two check valves, plus properly located test
cocks for the testing of the check and relief
valves. The entire assembly shall have been
manufactured in full compliance with the
American Water Works Association Standards
(C511-89) for reduced pressure principle
assemblies. The device shall operate to
maintain the pressure in the zone between the
two check valves at a level less than the
pressure on the city’s water supply side of the
device. At cessation of the normal flow the
pressure between the two check valves shall be
less than the pressure on the city’s water supply
side of the device. In case of leakage of either
of the check valves the differential relief valve
shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure
in the zone between the check valves by
discharging to the atmosphere. To be approved,
these devices must be readily accessible for inline
maintenance and testing and be installed in
a location where no part of the device will be
submerged. An acceptable method of handling
discharge water from the device must be
approved by the water and sewer department.
3. Double Check Valve Assembly. An
assembly of two independently operating
approved check valves with tightly closing
shut-off valves on each end of the check valve.
The entire assembly must have been
manufactured in full compliance with the
American Water Works Association Standard
(C510-89) for double check valve assemblies.
To be approved, these devices must be readily
accessible for in-line maintenance and testing.
4. Double Check-Detector Check Valve
Assembly. A specially designed assembly
composed of a line-size approved double check
valve assembly with a specific bypass fiveeighths
inch by three-fourths inch or threefourths
inch water meter and a three-fourths
inch approved double check valve assembly.
The meter shall register all rates of flow. This
assembly shall only be used to protect against a
non-health hazard.
5. Pressure Vacuum Breaker Assembly. An
assembly containing an independently
operating, loaded check valve and an
independently operating, loaded air inlet valve
located on the discharge side of the check
valve. The assembly shall be equipped with
properly located test cocks and tightly closing
shut off valves located at each end of the
assembly.
6. Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker. An
assembly containing a float check, a check seat
and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the
body causes the float to close the air inlet port.
When the flow of water stops, the float falls
and forms a check valve against backsiphonage
and at the same time opens the inlet port to
allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A
shutoff valve immediately upstream is also
required. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is
designed to protect against a health hazard
under a backsiphonage condition only. This
assembly is also known as the nonpressure type
vacuum breaker.
E. “Certified general tester” means a
person who holds a valid General tester
certification issued by the California-Nevada
American Water Works Association Section,
the Arizona State Environmental Technical
13.12.030
13-122
Training Center or other certifying authority
approved by the Arizona Department of
Environmental Quality.
F. “Cross-connection” means a crossconnection
as defined in Section 104-M of the
Uniform Plumbing Code as amended and as
adopted by the city from time to time.
G. “Industrial fluids” means any fluid or
solution which may be chemically, biologically
or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form
or concentration such as would constitute a
health, system, pollutant, or plumbing hazard if
introduced into the city’s water distribution
system. This may include, but is not limited to:
polluted or contaminated waters; all types of
process waters and used waters originating
from the city’s water distribution system which
may have deteriorated in sanitary quality;
chemicals in fluid form, plating acids and
alkalies, circulated cooling waters connected to
an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers
that are chemically or biologically treated or
stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated
natural waters; oils; gases; glycerin; paraffins;
caustic and acid solutions; and other liquid and
gaseous fluids used in industrial or other
purposes or for firefighting purposes.
H. “Used water” means any water supplied
by the city to a customer’s water system after it
has passed through the point of delivery and is
no longer under the sanitary control of the city.
(Ord. 626 § 5, 1993)
13.12.030 Application.
A. Except as provided in this section, the
provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
existing, new or replacement service
connections to the city’s water distribution
system. Approved backflow prevention
assemblies shall be installed on all existing
service connections by July 1, 1994 unless the
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality
approves an installation at a later date.
B. The provisions of this chapter shall not
apply to existing single-family residences used
solely for residential purposes unless a
backflow, backsiphonage or cross-connection
problem is identified at a particular residence
by inspection or site survey. In the event such a
problem is identified, the provisions of this
chapter shall apply to that particular singlefamily
residence.
C. Any water truck, wagon or tanker that is
filled through any unprotected connection to
the city’s water distribution system, such as a
fire hydrant or water hose, shall be equipped
with a reduced pressure backflow prevention
assembly or an air-gap separation. Such
assemblies shall be subject to the provisions of
this chapter.
D. Customers with an existing Class 1 or
Class 2 fire sprinkler systems constructed of
nonpotable material, which does not have an
approved backflow prevention assembly at the
time the ordinance codified in this chapter
becomes effective, may elect to conduct the
annual valve confidence - main drain test and
first draw water sample procedures provided in
Section III in lieu of installing an approved
backflow prevention device.
E. In no event shall a fire protection system
be out of service for more than eight
consecutive hours for any of the testing,
maintenance or repairs required by this chapter.
The Douglas fire department shall be
immediately notified of any change in the
service status of a fire protection system. (Ord.
626 § 2, 1993).
13.12.040
13-123
13.12.040 Class 1 and Class 2 fire
sprinkler systems.
A. This section applies to customers
making the election provided by Section
13.12.030 above. All procedures provided in
this section must be conducted by a licensed
L16 contractor. This option requires an annual
valve confidence - main drain test and first
draw water sample and is comprised of two
parts: (1) an annual fire protection system and
valve inspection and (2) an annual first draw
water sample collection. The main drain test
must be conducted in accordance with the
National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA)
25 (1992 Edition). The valve confidence test
requires the disassembly of the single check
valve to determine if the valve components are
in a good working order and function as
designed. A reading of pressure gauges to
observe differential pressures on each side of
the single check valve is not sufficient to meet
the requirements of this section. Results of the
test must be sent to the water and sewer
department and the Douglas fire department
within thirty days from the date of the test on
forms approved by the water and sewer
department.
B. An annual first draw water sample must
be collected at the same time as the annual
valve confidence - main drain tests. Two water
samples must be collected for the Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA) primary
contaminant heavy metals and bacteriological
(total coliform, presence/absence) analyses.
These water samples must be taken from the
upstream (supply) side of the fire protection
system before any other water is run from the
system. Proper sampling protocol must be
followed and chain-of-custody of the water
samples must be maintained. The analyses
must be performed by a certified laboratory.
Lab results must be sent to the water and sewer
department and the Douglas fire department
with forty-five days from the date of sampling.
C. The single check valve may continue in
place indefinitely following each annual valve
confidence test and first draw water sample so
long as the valve is operable and no upstream
(supply side) SDWA maximum contaminant
level (MCL) has been exceeded. In the event
either of the water sample analysis results
exceeds a SDWA MCL, the single check valve
shall be immediately replaced with an approved
double check valve assembly. A failed main
drain test shall require immediate corrective
action in accord with all applicable state and
local fire codes or as directed by the Douglas
fire department. (Ord. 626 § 3, 1993)
13.12.050 Temporary waiver of permit
fees for existing single-family
residences.
It is anticipated that state regulations will
require the installation of backflow prevention
devices on all single-family residences in the
foreseeable future. Therefore, in order to
encourage the voluntary installation of
backflow prevention devices, the city shall
waive the usual permit fees for the installation
of such devices in existing single-family
residences for a period of one year from the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this
chapter. (Ord. 626 § 4, 1993)
13.12.060 Termination of water service.
A. Water service to any premises connected
to the city’s water distribution system shall be
terminated, after the notice provided in Section
13.12.070, upon a determination by the water
and sewer department that one or more of the
13.12.070
13-124
conditions identified in subsection (B)(1), (2),
(3) or (4) of this section exists. Water service
shall not be resumed at such premises until the
water and sewer department determines that
such conditions have been corrected.
B. Water service to a fire protection system
shall not be subject to discontinuance under
this section. Any customer failing to correct a
condition identified in subsections (B)(1), (2),
(3), (4) or (5) in a connection to a fire
protection system shall be assessed a fine in the
amount of one hundred dollars for each day in
which the condition continues to exist after
thirty days from the date of notice provided in
Section 13.12.070.
1. An unprotected cross-connection exists
on the premises; or
2. An approved backflow prevention
assembly has not been installed as required by
this chapter, is not working, has been altered,
removed or bypassed or is found to otherwise
require the disconnection of the premises from
the city water distribution system by a certified
inspector provided in Section 13.12.090; or
3. A backflow, backsiphonage or crossconnection
problem is identified at a singlefamily
residence;
4. A test record of a backflow prevention
assembly, as required by Section 13.12.120 of
this chapter, has not been submitted to the
water and sewer department; or
5. A record of the annual valve confidence
- main drain test and first water sample is not
submitted as required by Section 13.12.040 of
this chapter. (Ord. 626 § 6, 1993)
13.12.070 Notice of discontinuance of
service.
The city shall give written notice to any
customer in violation of the provisions of
Section 13.12.060 of this chapter stating the
nature of the violation and the date on which
water service to the premises will be
terminated. Except in the case of an
emergency, such notice shall be given at least
thirty days prior to termination of service.
Notice herein shall be deemed given when
deposited in the United States mail at Douglas,
Arizona, postage paid, and addressed to the
water customer at whose premises the violation
is alleged to have occurred as such customer’s
address appears on the record of customers
maintained by the city for water billing
purposes. Any violation which involves an
immediate danger of potentially allowing any
substance into the city water distribution
system shall constitute an emergency and the
notice provided herein shall not be required
prior to terminating water service. (Ord. 626
§ 7, 1993)
13.12.080 Assembly requirement,
maintenance and repair.
A. Except as provided in Section 13.12.030,
all existing, new or replacement service
connections to the city water distribution
system shall be fitted with approved backflow
prevention assemblies. Approved backflow
prevention assemblies shall be installed in each
new single-family residence constructed after
the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this chapter. All assemblies shall be installed
and continuously maintained at the customer’s
expense to prevent the entry of any substance
whatsoever into the city’s water distribution
system, whether by overpressure on the
customer side of the meter or by reduced
pressure (vacuum) on the city’s side.
B. When any inspection or testing reveals
that a back-flow prevention assembly is in an
13.12.090
13-125
unsatisfactory operating condition or otherwise
in a nonpermitted condition under this chapter,
it shall be repaired or replaced by the customer,
at the customer’s expense. Any necessary
repairs, including replacement or overhaul of
the assembly, if necessary, shall be completed
within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty
days.
C. In addition to the requirements of this
chapter, all backflow prevention devices
installed on fire protection systems must be
installed in strict accordance with all current
National Fire Protection Association Standards
for the specific system involved. (Ord. 626 § 8,
1993)
13.12.090 Inspections.
A. All approved backflow prevention
assemblies and other assemblies which are
required by applicable federal, state, local or
other regulation to be tested or inspected
annually shall be subject to an inspection and
certification by the city after each testing of the
assembly. In instances where such assemblies,
if not properly installed or maintained could
pose a serious hazard to the city’s water
distribution system, those assemblies shall be
subject to more frequent inspections.
B. The inspections required under this
section shall be conducted to determine
whether cross-connection or other sanitary
hazards or violations of this chapter, or other
applicable regulations, exist. Such inspections
shall be carried out by an employee or
contractor of the city who is a certified general
tester. Such employee or contractor shall have
the right to enter any premises supplied with
city water in accordance with Section 1-16 of
the city water and sewer code.
C. An air-gap approved by the water and
sewer department shall be used to protect the
city’s water distribution system in any case
where, because of security requirements, other
prohibitions or restrictions, or because of the
complexity of the piping system serving the
premises, it will be impossible or impractical to
make a complete inspection of an assembly or
to otherwise ascertain whether any crossconnections
exist which may affect the city’s
water distribution system. (Ord. 626 § 9, 1993)
13.12.100 Assembly installation.
A. An assembly shall be installed outside,
aboveground, and adjacent to the meter on the
customer side. Such assemblies should be
protected from the elements. Where
construction or equipment located presents
siting problems for the assembly, a location
variance may be granted by the water and
sewer department, provided such request is
made in writing and approval is granted prior to
the installation of the assembly; in all cases the
assembly must be installed before the first
branch line leading off the service line. The
type of assembly required shall depend on the
degree of hazard where the following
conditions exist:
1. Contamination. Any premises where any
condition, device, practice or material may
create an actual or potential introduction of
water or substance which would be hazardous
to the public health into the city’s water
distribution system, shall be protected by an
approved air-gap separation or an approved
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention
assembly at the service connection to the
premises.
2. Auxiliary Water Supply. Any premises
where there is an auxiliary water supply,
13.12.110
13-126
whether or not directly connected with the
city’s water distribution system, shall be

thereof. (Ord. 418 §3, 1978)
15.20.030 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined in this section,
words or phrases used in this chapter shall be
interpreted so as to give them the same
meaning as they have in common usage and so
as to give this chapter its most reasonable
application:
A. “Areas of special flood hazard” means
the land within a community subject to a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This land is identified as Zone A
on the official map.
B. “Development” means any manmade
change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other
structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations.
C. “Flood” means a temporary rise in a
stream’s flow or stage that results in water
overflowing its banks and inundating areas
adjacent to the channel or an unusually and
rapid accumulation of runoff or surface waters
from any source.
D. “Floodproofing” means any combination
of structural and nonstructural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures, including
utility and sanitary facilities, which would
preclude the entry of water. Structural
components shall have the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effect of buoyancy.
E. “Habitable floor” means any floor
used for living which includes working,
sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation or
15-9
combination thereof. A floor used only for
storage purposes is not a habitable floor.
F. “Mobile home” means a structure,
transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and designed to be
used with or without a permanent foundation
when connected to the required utilities. It
does not include recreational vehicles or travel
trailers.
G. “Mobile home park” or “mobile home
subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous
parcels) of land which has been divided into
two or more lots for rent or sale and the
placement of mobile homes.
H. “One-hundred-year flood” means the
condition of flooding having a one-percent
chance of annual occurrence.
I. “Regulatory flood elevation” means the
water surface elevation of the one-hundredyear
flood.
J. “Structure” means a walled or roofed
structure, including a gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above the ground, including
but without limitation to buildings, factories,
sheds, cabins, mobile homes and other similar
uses.
K. “Substantial improvement” means any
repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds
fifty percent of the market value of the
structure either (1) before the improvement is
started, or (2) if the structure has been damaged
and is being restored before the damage
occurred. For the purpose of this definition
“substantial improvement” is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. The term does not, however, include
any alternation to comply with existing state or
local health, sanitary, building or safety codes
or regulations as well as structures listed in
national or state registers of historic places.
(Ord. 418 §11, 1978)
15.20.040 Permits required.
No person, firm or corporation shall erect,
construct, enlarge or improve any building or
structure in the city or cause the same to be
done without first obtaining a separate
development permit for each such building or

relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
habitable floor (including basement) or in the
case of floodproofed nonresidential structures,
15-10
the elevation to which it has been floodproofed.
Documentation or certification of such
elevations will be maintained by the city
engineer.
7. Give such other information as
reasonably may be required by the city
engineer. (Ord. 418 §4, 1978)
15.20.050 Review of permit applications.
The city engineer or his designee shall
review all development permit applications to

Administration in a Flood Insurance Study; and
require within areas designated as Zone A on
the official map that the following performance
standards be met:
1. The first floor elevation (to
include basement) of new residential structures
is elevated to or above the regulatory flood
elevation;
2. The first floor elevation (to
include basement of nonresidential structures)

applications.
The mayor and city council shall approve all
subdivision applications and shall make
findings of fact and assure that:
A. All such proposed developments are
consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
B. Subdivision proposals and other
proposed new development greater than five
acres or fifty lots, whichever is lesser, include
within such proposals regulatory flood
elevation data in areas designated Zone A;
C. Adequate drainage is provided so as to
15-11
reduce exposure to flood hazards;
D. All public utilities and facilities are
located so as to minimize or eliminate flood
damage. (Ord. 418 §7, 1978)
15.20.080 New water and sewer systems.
New and replacement water and sewer
systems shall be constructed to eliminate or
minimize infiltration by or discharge into
floodwaters. Moreover, on-site waste disposal
systems will be designed to avoid impairment
or contamination during flooding. (Ord. 418
§8, 1978)
15.20.090 Alteration or relocation of
watercourse.
The mayor and city council will insure that
the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of any watercourse is
maintained. The city will notify, in riverine
situations, adjacent communities and the state
coordinating office prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies
of such notifications to the administrator.
Moreover, the city will work with appropriate
state and federal agencies in every way
possible in complying with the National Flood
Insurance Program in accordance with the
National Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973. (Ord. 418 §9, 1978)
15.20.100 Compliance with National
Flood Insurance Program.
This chapter shall take precedence over
conflicting ordinances or parts of ordinances.
The city council may, from time to time, amend
this chapter to reflect any and all changes in the
National Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973. The regulations of this chapter are in
compliance with the National Flood Insurance
Program Regulation as published in the Federal
Register, Volume 41, Number 207, dated
October 26, 1976, a pertinent portion of which
has been excerpted and hereinafter set forth:
§1910.3 Flood plain management criteria
for flood-prone areas.
The Administrator will provide the data
upon which flood plain management
regulations shall be based. If the Administrator
has not provided sufficient data to furnish a
basis for these regulations in a particular
community, the community shall obtain,
review and reasonably utilize data available
from other federal, state or other sources
pending receipt of data from the Administrator.
However, when special flood hazard area
designations and water surface elevations have
been furnished by the Administrator, they shall
apply. The symbols defining such special flood
hazard designations are set forth in §1914.3 of
this subchapter. In all cases the minimum
requirements governing the adequacy of the
flood plain management regulations for floodprone
areas adopted by a particular community
depend on the amount of technical data
formally provided to the community by the
Administrator. Minimum standards for
communities are as follows:
(a) When the Administrator has not defined
the special flood hazard areas within a
community, has not provided water surface
elevation data, and has not provided sufficient
data to identify the floodway or coastal high
hazard area, but the community has indicated
the presence of such hazards by submitting an
application to participate in the Program, the
community shall:
(1) Require permits for all proposed
construction or other development in the
community, including the placement of mobile
homes, so that it may determine whether such
15-12
construction or other development is proposed
within flood-prone areas;
(2) Review proposed development
to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those governmental agencies
from which approval is required by federal or
state law, including section 404 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
(3) Review all permit applications
to determine whether proposed building sites
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is in a flood-prone area,
all new construction and substantial
improvements (including the placement of
prefabricated buildings and mobile homes)
shall (i) be designed (or modified) and
adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure,
(ii) be constructed with materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage, and (iii)
be constructed by methods and practices that
minimize flood damage;
(4) Review subdivision proposals
and other proposed new development to
determine whether such proposals will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision
proposal or other proposed new development is
in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall
be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals
are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage within the flood-prone area, (ii) all
public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems are located
and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is provided
to reduce exposure to flood hazards;
(5) Require within flood-prone
areas new and replacement water supply
systems to be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems; and
(6) Require within flood-prone
areas (i) new and replacement sanitary sewage
systems to be designed to minimize or
eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems and discharges from the systems into
flood waters and (ii) on-site waste disposal
systems to be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during
flooding.
(b) When the Administrator has designated
areas of special flood hazards (A zones) by the
publication of a community’s FHBM, but has
neither produced water surface elevation data
nor identified a floodway or coastal high
hazard area, the community shall:
(1) Require permits for all proposed
construction and other developments including
the placement of mobile homes, within Zone A
on the community’s FHBM;
(2) Require the application of the
standards in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and
(6) of this section to development within Zone
A on the community’s FHBM;
(3) Require that all subdivision
proposals and other proposed new
developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres,
whichever is the lesser, include within such
proposals base flood elevation data;
(4) Obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation data available
from a federal, state, or other source, until such
other data has been provided by the
Administrator, as criteria for requiring that (i)
all new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated to
or above the base flood level and (ii) all new
construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures have the lowest floor
15-13
(including basement) elevated or floodproofed
to or above the base flood level;
(5) For the purpose of the
determination of applicable flood insurance
risk premium rates within Zone A on a
community’s FHBM, (i) obtain the elevation
(in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
habitable floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structures, and
whether or not such structures contain a
basement, (ii) obtain, if the structure has been
floodproofed, the elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was
floodproofed, and (iii) maintain a record of all
such information with the official designated
by the community under §1909-.22(a) (9) (iii);
(6) Notify, in riverine situations,
adjacent communities and the State
Coordinating Office prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies
of such notifications to the Administrator;
(7) Assure that the flood carrying
capacity within the altered or relocated portion
of any watercourse is maintained;
(8) Require that all mobile homes
to be placed within Zone A on a community’s
FHBM shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement by providing
over-the-top and frame ties to ground anchors.
Specific requirements shall be that (i) over-thetop
ties be provided at each of the four corners
of the mobile home, with two additional ties
per side at intermediate locations and mobile
homes less than fifty feet long requiring one
additional tie per side; (ii) frame ties be
provided at each corner of the home with five
additional ties per side at intermediate points
and mobile homes less than fifty feet long
requiring four additional ties per side; (iii) all
components of the anchoring system be capable
of carrying a force of four thousand eight
hundred pounds; and (iv) any additions to the
mobile home be similarly anchored;
(9) Require that an evacuation plan
indicating alternate vehicular access and escape
routes be filed with appropriate Disaster
Preparedness Authorities for mobile home
parks and mobile home subdivisions located
within Zone A on the community’s FHBM.
(c) When the Administrator has provided a
notice of final base flood elevations within
Zones A1-30 on the community’s FIRM and, if
appropriate, has designated A0 zones, A99
zones and unnumbered A zones on the
community’s FIRM, but has not identified a
regulatory floodway or coastal high hazard
area, the community shall:
(1) Require the standards of
paragraph (b) of this section within all A1-30
zones, unnumbered A zones and A0 zones, on
the community’s FIRM;
(2) Require that all new
construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures within Zones A1-30 on
the community’s FIRM have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated to or above the
base flood level, unless the community is
granted an exception by the Administrator for
the allowance of basements and/or storm
cellars in accordance with §1910.6(b) (3) (b)
and (4);
(3) Require that all new
construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures within Zones A1-30
on the community’s FIRM (i) have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated to or above
the base flood level or, (ii) together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capacity of
15-14
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and effects of buoyancy;
(4) Provide that where
floodproofing is utilized for a particular
structure in accordance with paragraphs (c) (3)
and (c) (8) of this section or (b) (3) of §1910.6
either (i) a registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the floodproofing
methods are adequate to withstand the flood
depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift
forces and other factors associated with the
base flood, and a record of such certificates
indicating the specific elevation (in relation to
mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained with the
official designated by the community under
§1910.6 shall be submitted to the Administrator
for approval;
(5) Require within Zones A1-30 on
the community’s FIRM for new mobile home
parks and mobile home subdivisions, for
expansions to existing mobile home parks and
mobile home subdivisions, and for existing
mobile home parks and mobile home
subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction or
improvement of the streets, utilities and pads
equals or exceeds fifty percent of the value of

B. Platting Procedures and Requirements
1. General
a. Outline of procedures.
Preparation, submission, review and official action concerning all subdivision plats for
locations within the city proceed through the following progressive stages:
1) Preapplication stage;
2) Preliminary plat stage;
3) Final plat stage;
b. Subdivision committee.
A subdivision committee composed of the community development director, City engineer,
and City planner is hereby delegated authority to represent the commission in
preapplication conferences and investigations and to perform such other functions as may
be assigned by the chairman of the commission.
2. Preapplication Stage
a. Generally.
The preapplication stage of subdivision planning comprises an investigatory period
preceding preparation of the preliminary plat. If, during this stage, it is determined that a
change in zoning will be proposed for all or part of the tract, the subdivider should initiate
an application for rezoning simultaneously with submission of the preliminary plat.
b. Actions by the subdivider.
The subdivider shall confer with the committee and present informally a general outline of
his proposal, including but not limited to:
1) Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, street and lot arrangement, and tentative lot
sizes.
2) Tentative proposals regarding utility and street improvements.
c. Actions by the subdivision committee.
The subdivision committee shall advise the subdivider of procedures, design and
improvements standards and platting requirements. The committee shall investigate the
following aspects of the proposal and report its recommendations to the subdivider:
1) Existing zoning or proposed zoning amendment.
7
2) Adequacy of existing and proposed school, recreation and other public sites.
3) Existing and proposed street and utility systems, existing and proposed uses of
adjoining lands and any special problems such as topography, drainage and flooding.
3. Preliminary Plat Stage
a. Generally.
The preliminary plat stage includes preparation, submission, review and approval of the
preliminary plat. Processing will be expedited by submission of all information essential to
determining the intended character and general acceptability of the proposal.
b. Preliminary plat submission.
1) An application for preliminary plat approval, together with five (5) copies of the
preliminary plat with one (1) copy in electronic format (CD) and one (1) copy in eleven
(11) inch by seventeen (17) inch and required supporting data, prepared in accordance
with section B (3)(f) of this chapter, shall be filed with the City planner. The regular
commission meeting at which the subdivider desires to be heard will be held thirty (30)
days after the committee approves the plat.
2) The preliminary plat shall be designed to meet all requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located; however, in the event that rezoning is deemed necessary, such
application shall accompany submission of preliminary plat. An application for
rezoning may be heard by the commission at the same meeting as the preliminary plat
but shall be acted upon separately. When a preliminary plat constitutes only one unit
of a larger development intended for progressive plating, rezoning shall usually be
limited to the area contained in the first plat.
3) The application shall include payment to the City of the filing fee.
4) If it meets requirements of the Subdivision Code and Engineering Design Standards
Manuel, the application shall be assigned a case number; otherwise, it shall be rejected
and the subdivider notified as to the deficiencies.
c. Preliminary plat review by subdivision committee.
1) The committee shall review the preliminary plat for compliance to provisions of this
chapter and distribute copies of the plat to:
a) The public works director, for review of street plans, drainage, flood control, water
supply and sewage disposal proposals.
b) Superintendents of the elementary and high school districts, for their information.
8
2) The committee shall summarize its recommendations for modifications or change. It
may be sufficiently important to postpone commission action until the problem has been
resolved with the subdivider.
d. Commission hearing and action.
1) If all requirements of this chapter have been met, the commission shall consider the
preliminary plat at a regular meeting within thirty (30) days of the committee’s
approval of the plat.
2) If satisfied that all objectives of these regulations have been met, the commission shall
approve the preliminary plat, and the chairman shall note such approval on three (3)
copies of the plat, returning one to the subdivider, retaining one in the commission
files, and holding one for review by public utilities.
3) If the plat is generally acceptable but requires minor revision before preparation of the
final plat, the commission shall conditionally approve and specify the required
revisions in its meeting minutes.
4) If the commission determines that the plat contains major deficiencies and if the
subdivider agrees to correct such deficiencies, the case may be held over pending
revision, resubmission and reprocessing; otherwise, the preliminary plat shall be
rejected. If the commission rejects the plat, reasons for rejection shall be recorded in
the minutes and therefore, any new filing of a plat for the same tract, or any part
thereof, shall follow normal procedures and be subjected to a new filing fee.
e. Significance of approval.
Approval of a preliminary plat constitutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with
the preparation of the final plat and engineering plans. Preliminary approval is valid for a
period of eighteen (18) months from date, and may be extended upon written request once
for six (6) months at the discretion of the subdivision committee. The subdivider may
submit the final plat, or any part thereof, on or before the expiration date. If approval
expires prior to filing of the final plat, the preliminary plat shall be resubmitted for approval
as a new case, and a new fee paid. If the subdivision committee’s review of the resubmitted
plat reveals no substantial change from the previously approved preliminary plat, and that
conditions under which previous approval was granted have not changed, the resubmitted
plat shall be scheduled for hearing by the commission at its first regular meeting thereafter.
f. Information required for preliminary plat submission.
1) Preliminary plat information shall be presented on one or more plan sheets with written
date entered directly thereon or contained in letters attached thereto. All mapped data
for the same plat shall be drawn at the same standard engineering scale, said scale
having no more than one hundred (100) feet to the inch.
2) The following shall be shown on the plat:

b. Side lots lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines, except where
other treatment can be justified.
c. Every lot shall abut upon a public street furnishing satisfactory access to another existing
public street; except that where special circumstances justify, private streets may be
permitted provided that they are constructed to standards acceptable to the City, are
contained in a permanent private easement, and responsibility for continued maintenance is
vested in a corporation of lot owners.
d. Single-family residence lots extending through the block and having frontage on two nonintersecting
streets shall be prohibited. Reverse frontage along any street shall be prohibited

(35) feet in length measured from the rear lot line in locations designated by the
public utility.
b. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, utility easements or alleys shall usually consist of a
series of straight lines with points of deflection not less than one hundred twenty (120) feet
apart, said points of deflection not always occurring at the junction of side and rear lot lines
on the side of the exterior angle; however, curvilinear easements or alleys may be employed,
providing that the minimum radii of center lines are not less than eight hundred (800) feet.
c. Where an important surface drainage course abuts or crosses the tract, dedication of a public
drainageway of width sufficient to permit widening, deepening, relocating or protecting such
drainage course shall be required.

extension of time under specified conditions. The council may require of the subdivider
such further assurances of completion of improvements as may be justified in the interests
of the future lot owners and the general public.
18
CHAPTER II: STREETS / ROAD DESIGN
A. Street Location and Arrangement
1. Whenever a subdivision embraces any part of a street designated in the adopted major street
plan, such street shall be platted in conformity therewith.
2. Street layout shall provide for the continuation of existing collector streets in adjacent areas,
and such other streets as the Public Works Director may designate.
3. Whenever the tract is located within an area for which a neighborhood plan has been approved
by the Planning & Zoning (P&Z) Commission, the street arrangement shall conform
substantially to that plan.
4. Certain proposed streets, as designated by the P & Z Commission, shall be extended to the
subdivision boundary to provide future connection with adjoining unplatted lands at the full
expense of the Developer.
5. Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by traffic originating outside the
immediate area.
6. When a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial route, the P & Z
Commission may require marginal access streets or reverse frontage with non-access easements
along the arterial route, or such other treatment as may be justified for protection of properties
from the nuisance and hazard of high volume traffic and for preservation of the traffic function
of the arterial route.
7. When a residential subdivision abuts the right-of-way of a railroad or limited access highway or
abuts a commercial or industrial land use, the Public Works Department may require the
placement of a street approximately parallel to such right-of-way or use at a distance suitable
for appropriate use of intervening land, such distance being determined with due regard for
approach grades, access, drainage, bridges or future grade separations.
8. Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to produce desirable lots of
maximum utility and streets of reasonable gradient, and to facilitate adequate drainage.
9. Except where alleys are justified by special conditions, they are not considered appropriate in
residential subdivisions; however, continuation to a logical outlet of an existing dead-end alley
in an adjoining subdivision and the extension of an existing alley pattern where underground
utilities are located in alleys shall be considered justifying conditions. When alleys are platted,
the alley alignment and arrangement shall be such as to provide optimum convenience for truck
service circulation and to avoid alley openings opposite fronts of residential lots. Alleys shall
be required at the rear of multi-family residential, commercial or industrial developments,
except where, in the opinion of the P & Z Commission, other provision is made for adequate
permanent access for purposes of fire protection, parking and loading.
19
10. Half-streets are discouraged except where necessary to provide right-of-way required by the
major street plan, to complete a street pattern already begun, or to ensure reasonable
development of an adjoining unplatted parcel. Where a half-street already exists abutting the
an existing subdivision, then the existing half street must be built to the full build-out street
section and at the full expense of the Developer.
11. Street sections shall be constructed to minimum pavement requirements as stated in these
design guidelines. Additional paving sections may be required by the soils report.

28
E. Paving Requirements – Technical Specifications
1. City of Douglas Asphalt and Paving Policy:
The City of Douglas is willing under certain circumstances to sell asphalt to residents and
contractors within Arizona and a twenty five (25) mile radius of the corporate limits of the City
of Douglas. This willingness stems from (1) the need to support the public good of improving
off-street parking opportunities within the above stated area through a reduction of traffic
congestion, (2) improving dust control, and drainage control, (3) minimizing erosion, and (4)
promoting of vehicle/pedestrian safety. The Mayor and Council must authorize the sale of
asphalt of over 200 tons to residents or contractors doing work within a 25-mile radius of the
corporate limits of the City, within the United States. Any amount under 200 tons per purchase
may be approved by the City Manager until total sales during the prior 12 months to the same
person or entity have exceeded 3000 tons. At that time the Council must approve future
requests. The City Manager may authorize up to 200 tons per purchase to the City of Agua
Prieta, State of Sonora, or Country of Mexico provided said asphalt is to be used by these
public agencies within a 25-mile radius of Douglas. In the event sales exceed 3000 tons in a
12-month period, the agency’s request will be taken to the Mayor and Council for
consideration.
Such material sales are authorized only at such time as the asphalt plant is operating and only to
the extent that excess material over that needed for City projects can be reasonably produced.
All material purchases must be picked up by the purchaser at the City asphalt plant.
The price of the asphalt sold by the City shall be established at the average market price in
effect and charged by private enterprises in Cochise County within 10 days of the order for pick
up at the place of business of the private enterprise or at a price specified by the Mayor and
Council.
There also may be occasions that the City is requested to perform paving services along with
the sale of asphalt. This practice will be limited to churches and qualified private non-profit
organizations or corporations operating within the corporate limits of the City of Douglas. This
service will be performed only if approved by the Council and is determined to be for the
public benefit by providing dust control, improving drainage and minimizing property
deterioration, reducing standing water, and creating safer properties by promoting
vehicle/pedestrian safety.
A church or qualified non-profit organization or corporation must file a written request with the
City Manager for paving or repaving of a lot. The request must include the size of the lot to be
paved and the thickness of asphalt needed. Staff will present the cost of the paving when the
council considers the request for paving services. The cost will include equipment charges,
labor rate, and material. All charges will be charged at a rate as specified by the Mayor and
Council at the time of approval. Labor will be charged at the hourly rate of the employee
including all fringe benefit costs associated. Material will be charged as described above under
material purchases. If the City Council approves the request, the paving will be scheduled into
the Department of Public Works paving schedule. Paving will commence within the 120 days
of approval as long as City equipment is in proper working order. All payments for material
and services must be paid in advance, unless the Mayor and Council or City Manager approves
29
a payment plan. When paving services are provided, the applicant must provide written
agreement to pay for all actual increases in component costs for labor, equipment or materials
beyond that approved by the Council when those increases occur between the approval date and
actual installation date.
Pavement Cuts
There is a five (5) year moratorium on pavement cuts from the time asphalt concrete is placed
in that specific location. There will be instances when, due to an emergency situation, the
pavement must be cut to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. In these
cases, the Director of Public Works can give approval of such pavement cuts.
This policy is intended to discourage pavement cuts beyond the five-year moratorium. All
other options must be considered including but not limited to boring under the street and
rerouting around the street.
Prior to any pavement cuts, a right-of-way permit must be obtained from the Department of
Public Works.
2. All work and materials must conform to the current uniform standard specifications and details
as published by the Maricopa Association of Governments (M.A.G.) and as amended by the
Public Works Department.
3. The Contractor shall obtain any and all permits required unless otherwise noted. A preconstruction
meeting will be mandatory.
4. The Contractor shall notify the Public Works Department a minimum of forty eight (48) hours
in advance to any construction.
5. The Contractor shall be responsible for blue stake and locating underground utilities. The
Contractor shall be responsible for any and all damage that may be incurred to the utilities and
be liable for any repair costs including accidental costs.
6. The Project/Design Engineer shall certify that he has contacted all utility companies and has
transferred, according to information furnished by said utility companies prior to plan approval,
all existing and/or proposed utility lines and all existing and required right-of-way and
easement lines. However, the Contractor is solely responsible for determining the exact
location of all existing utilities in the immediate area prior to the beginning of construction.
7. One set of stakes will be furnished by the Contractor for the curb and gutter, sidewalk, subgrade
and ABC. All additional staking will be charged to the Contractor. Forty eight (48) hours
advance notice is required for staking.
8. All manhole frames and covers, cleanouts and water valve boxes and covers shall be adjusted to
finish grade per MAG Std. Detail No. 270 and Spec. No. 345.
30
9. Construction of surface improvements shall not begin until conflicting underground utility
construction is completed and service connections to all platted lots have been adequately
extended.
10. All underground utilities and street surfacing shall be constructed and completed prior to the
issuance of any building permits.
11. Developer, Contractor and Suddivider shall provide to all the underground utilities a certificate
of grade prior to the commencement of utility trenching to ensure that the roadway subgrade is
within acceptable finish grade that meets or exceeds the minimum coverage requirement set by
each underground utility. The certification of grade shall read as follows “I, the undersigned,
hereby certifies to the individual members of the Douglas Infrastructure Group (DIG), that I, on
behalf of the above property owner(s), surveyed and marked the property corners and/or utility
easements as required along the route of the proposed DIG facility installation for the xxxxx
project and have found the existing ground to be within six inches of final and finish grade
where the DIG trench and all related DIG equipment are to be placed”.
12. Damaged asphalt and/or displaced concrete curb, gutter, sidewalk or driveway slab that is
within the right-of-way shall be replaced or repaired as directed by the City before final
acceptance of the work by the City.
13. Acceptance of the completed right-of-way improvements shall not be given until:
a. Reproducible “as-built record drawings” have been submitted by a registered professional
engineer and accepted by the Public Works Department. When the Public Work
Department provides inspection, the registered engineer shall certify that staking was

45
CHAPTER VI: STREETS / SIGNALS
A. Design
1. Signal design requirements and guidelines shall be in accordance with the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (M.U.T.C.D.), Chapter 4 (2003 Edition).
B. City Traffic Signal Definitions, Warrants & Design References
1. Definition.
A traffic control signal (traffic signal) shall be defined as any highway traffic signal by which
traffic is alternately directed to stop and permitted to proceed.
Traffic shall be defined as pedestrians, bicyclists, ridden or herded animals, vehicles, streetcars,
and other conveyances either singularly or together while using any highway for purposes of
travel.
Standards for traffic control signals are important because traffic control signals need to attract
the attention of a variety of road users, including those who are older, those with impaired
vision, as well as those who are fatigued or distracted, or who are not expecting to encounter a
signal at a particular location.
2. Engineering Studies.
The selection and use of traffic control signals should be based on an engineering study of
roadway, traffic, and other conditions. A careful analysis of traffic operations, pedestrian and
bicyclist needs, and other factors at a large number of signalized and unsignalized locations,
coupled with engineering judgment, has provided a series of signal warrants that define the
minimum conditions under which installing traffic control signals might be justified.
Engineering judgment should be applied in the review of operating traffic control signals to

1. Water main design shall be based on maximum day flows, as listed in Table III, plus fire flows.
Appurtenances (booster, reservoirs, etc.) shall be designed for peak hour of the maximum day
with provisions for fire flow and emergency flows as required. The peak hour is one point
seven (1.7) times the maximum day demand. System pressures should be maintained between
sixty (60) and one hundred (100) psi for maximum day velocity and should not exceed five (5)
fps or a head loss of ten feet per 1000 feet (10 ft./1,000 ft.), whichever is limiting.

CHAPTER X: DRAINAGE – DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION
A. Storm Drainage General Information
1. Adequate provisions shall be made for disposal of storm waters from both private lots and
public streets and to avoid impoundment at any point within the subdivision. Existing major
surface drainage courses shall be maintained and dedicated as drainage ways. The type,
extent, location and capacity of drainage facilities shall be determined for the individual
subdivision by the Public Works Director and shall be constructed accordingly. Where storm
water is discharged into any outlet not directly controlled by the City, the subdivider shall
submit satisfactory evidence that the use of such outlet is approved by the owner custodian
designee.
2. Design Requirement for Storm Drainage.
All developments within the City shall provide such storm drainage facilities as are necessary
to insure that all improvements, structures and properties, both within the subject development
and those located upstream and downstream of the development, shall be protected from the
adverse impact of storm water due to the proposed development.
A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan shall be required of all development/construction
projects unless determined to be non-applicable by the Director of Public Works. Each
development shall comply, as a minimum, with NPDES notification to the EPA and
implementation of SWPPP control measures, as defined and required by the “Best Management
Practices” of the City of Douglas.
3. System Classification.
a. The "Minor System" (10-year) shall consist of those collection and/or retention/detention
facilities necessary to collect, convey, retain and/or detain storm water runoff from the
more frequent rainfalls. The "Minor System" shall be designed to accommodate storms
up to and including a "ten (10) year storm" and shall be used only when specifically
approved by the Public Works Director.
b. The "Major System" (100-year storm of duration) shall consist of those facilities
necessary to convey storm water runoff from storms up to and including a "one-hundred
year storm." It consists primarily of the planning and/or analysis of the overall drainage
system to insure: that there is always positive drainage from all areas, that the "onehundred
year" flows can safely pass through the project, and that all structures are above
the one hundred (100) year water elevation in areas where temporary and/or long duration
ponding may occur as well as those areas lying within the FEMA floodplain.
4. Drainage Facilities Components.
a. Collection System. This portion of the system is intended to collect and convey runoff to
either retention/detention, trunk line storm drain facilities and/or outfall into natural and
man-made drainage channel facilities.
83
b. Retention/Detention Facilities. This portion of the system is intended to retain/detain
sufficient volumes of runoff to minimize the adverse impact of new developments on
downstream areas. All developments must provide retention/detention facilities.
5. Reports.
a. Drainage Report. A drainage report is a report that is required for any site greater than one
(1) acre in size or for any site subject to detention requirements. The drainage report shall
contain all elements of a hydrology report, as well as descriptive data of the appropriate
components for the required detention facility design. In addition, a drainage report shall
be required for any site where extensive structural improvements for mitigating drainage
impacts are required.
b. Hydrology Report. A hydrology report is a report required for developments which are
not subject to detention requirements, nor which require extensive structural
improvements for handling drainage; but which are impacted by flows from significant
watercourses and/or affected by 100-year flows of 500 cfs, or more. The objective of a
hydrology report is to establish finished-floor elevations, which assure that all structures
are free from flooding during a regulatory flood. Additional objectives of a hydrology
report are to establish the size and configuration of flow-through wall openings and other
minor drainage features; and, if required by the Public Works Director, to develop a
grading plan which demonstrates adequate site drainage with no resulting impact to
upstream or downstream properties.
c. The review and approval of drainage reports, hydrology reports, and drainage statements
by the Public Works Director are typically in response to reports and statements submitted
in order to satisfy one of the following: (1) a requirement of rezoning; (2) a specific
requirement for approval of a subdivision plat or a development plan; (3) approval of a
disclosure statement prepared in conjunction with a condominium conversion; (4) the
request for a floodplain, building, or grading permit for a parcel located within either a
regulatory floodplain, an erosion/building-setback zone, or an identified flood-hazard
area; or (5) application for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
B. Design
1. Finish Floor Elevations.
a. Finish floor (FF) elevations shall be a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the
calculated one hundred (100) year storm event elevation.
b. Per individual lot, finish floor elevations shall not be less than fourteen (14) inches above
the low top of curb elevation nor less than six (6) inches above the high top of curb
elevation of the subject lot.
84
c. For manufactured homes or trailers, the lot pad elevation shall be used in lieu of a fixed
finished floor elevation.
2. Street Drainage.
a. The basis of design for local streets shall be designed to carry the ten (10) year storm
being contained within the pavement section with a maximum depth of six (6) inches.
b. Streets shall be designed to carry the following minimum flows:
1) Major and minor arterial streets to carry a ten (10) year flow between the curbs and
maintain a twelve-foot dry lane in each direction; and carry the one hundred (100)
year flow within the right-of-way with a maximum depth of six (6) inches over the
crown of the street, for emergency vehicles and evacuation purposes.
2) Collectors and local streets shall be designed to carry ten (10) year flows between the
curbs, the fifty (50) year flows between the property lines, and the one hundred (100)
year flow within the right-of-way. The grading plans must substantiate the flow
containment capability.
3) Underground storm drains are required when the above street capacity or maximum
depth is exceeded.
3. Underground Storm Drains.
a. Underground storm drains shall be provided whenever the capacity of the pavement
section or maximum depth is exceeded by the design storm event.
b. Pipes shall be sized using "Manning's Formula". Values of Manning's "n" shall be from
appropriate technical literature and shall be referenced.
c. Velocities shall range from three (3) feet per second to nine (9) feet per second in order to
prevent sedimentation and abrasion damage.
d. The minimum pipe size shall be fifteen (15) inch ID, RGRCP class IV minimum in the
right-of-way or easement maintained by the City.
e. The hydraulic grade line (HGL) for the design storm may be above the pipe, provided that
it remains at least one (1) foot below the ground elevation at all manholes, catch basins,
inlets, etc., the pipe shall be designed to operate with the calculated head pressure
provided the HGL does not compromise the operation of the storm drain system. The
HGL shall be provided on the profile portion of the storm drain plan and profile.
f. When the pipe changes direction more than 30 degrees there shall be manhole installed
with a drop, between match points, of at least 0.1 feet. In no case shall the deflection
angle be greater than 90 degrees.
g. Pipe and culverts installed in City easements and rights-of-way shall be bedded from
85
bottom of excavation to one (1) foot above the pipe with granular bedding material in
accordance with the requirements of Section 601.4.6 of MAG Uniform Standard
Specifications, or the manufacturer’s recommendations, whichever is more restrictive.
Bedding compaction densities shall be per MAG Specification Table 601-2. The initial
4” bedding under the pipe is required for pipe having an inside diameter of 12" or larger,
and in all cases where rock larger than 1-1/2" is encountered in the trench bottom, the
requirements of MAG Standard Specification 601.2.5 shall apply. Specially designed and
alternate bedding will be approved on a case by case basis.
h. Minimum trench backfill requirements shall be per MAG Specification 601.4, with
compaction densities per MAG Specification Table 601-2. Backfill requirements
provided by the Project/Design Engineer shall apply, when such provisions are more
restrictive than MAG Specification.
4. Retention/Detention Basins.
a. Basis of Design. All retention/detention facilities shall be sized to retain 100% of the one
hundred (100) year, six (6) hour storm falling over the entire project site including the
total adjacent right(s)-of-way. For the purpose of determining the volume required, the
project shall be considered to extend to the centerline of all existing and future streets on
the exterior boundaries and to include all interior streets and other rights-of-way within
the project.
b. Freeboard. There shall be a one (1) foot freeboard from the basin overflow water surface
elevation to the lowest adjacent building elevation and/or equal to the gutter of the
upstream streets. The freeboard for all project building floor elevations shall be a
minimum of fourteen (14) inches above the project outfall water surface elevation.
c. Volume. The following data shall be provided for each retention/detention basin:
1) Volume Required. The volume required in cubic feet shall be computed using the
City’s developments as urban with respect to percentage of impervious cover.
2) Volume Provided. The volume provided shall be submitted in a table noting the
stage-capacity relationships. All basins shall be sized to retain the calculated required
volume within the first three (3) feet of elevation. Calculated required volume (Vr) is
defined as:
Vr = CPA
12 where C = roughness coefficient
P = precipitation
A = area, in square feet
For compliance, Vr is compared to actual basin incremental volume at the three (3)
foot basin level.
d. Retention/Detention basins shall be located such that they can intercept the flows from the
entire site. If portions of the project cannot drain to the primary basin, additional basins
86
shall be added to retain/detain runoff from these areas.
e. The sub-drainage areas for each basin shall be denoted on the plans and the calculations
for each sub-basin retention/detention required, shall be provided. Overflow from any
sub-basin may be safely routed to another sub-basin, to ultimately be contained in the
compilation of retention/detention provided.
f. The High Water Level (HWL) shall be denoted on the plans for each basin or ponding
area. The basin depth (overall average depth) shall be measured from the lowest point to
the elevation of the basin overflow. This is not to be considered the water surface
elevation of the basin’s retention depth (HWL) for the period storm event.
g. The Outfall elevation and each basin Overflow elevation shall be shown on the plans.
h. The overall average depth shall not exceed three (3) feet without authorization of the
Public Works Director. At the City's option, the basin may be fenced to allow steeper side
slopes or greater depths. In no case shall the depth exceed one (1) foot without a positive
means (not relying on evaporation) of disposing of accumulated runoff.
i. The bottom of all basins shall be sloped towards the discharge points. The minimum
bottom slope shall be 0.1%.
j. Side Slopes.
1) Side slopes adjacent to public rights-of-way, or when there is pedestrian type access
to that portion of the basin, shall have a side slope of 6:1 or flatter. There shall be at
least two (2) feet of level ground between the back of the sidewalk and the beginning
of the side slope grading.
2) Side slopes adjacent to walls, fences, and hedges, etc. (i.e., no or limited pedestrian
type access in that area) may have side slopes up to 4:1 if adjacent to public right-ofway
or easement and 3:1 if adjacent to private property. There shall be at least two
(2) feet of level ground adjacent from any wall or vertical obstruction to the top of the
side slope grading.
3) The following depth/side slope criteria may be used as approved by the Public Works
Director:
Basin Depth (feet) Side Slope
< 4 4:1
4-6 6:1
6-9 10:1
> 9 14:1
k. In the event project basins fail and over top, runoff shall be routed towards an outfall
point. Each subdivision shall be designed such that the "ultimate" outfall for all drainage
is a public street, storm drain, drainage channel or natural watercourse. The outfall shall
be accessible without draining over private property. Design engineers must evaluate
87
cases where project outfall conditions occur and take necessary actions to prevent
flooding or damage to properties located downstream of the outfall. Additionally, all
project site finished floors must be a minimum of fourteen inches (14”) above the outfall
water surface elevation.
l. All retention/detention facilities shall have a positive method of disposing of retained or
detained runoff waters. 100% of the 100 year 6 hour storm being retained/detained shall
be disposed of within 36 hours. Public streets are not considered to be an acceptable
outlet for disposal of retained or detained runoff. However, streets are considered an
acceptable outlet for the conveyance of basin overflow or project outfall.
m. Acceptable methods of disposal of accumulated storm water runoff are:
1) A bleed-off discharge to an existing storm drain or drainage channel of sufficient
capacity to convey the anticipated flows from the tributary drainage area after the
storm.
2) The maximum bleed-off discharge rate shall be 1 cfs. This rate can be achieved by
the addition of a 6" diameter hole in a plate mounted on the discharge structure. Use
a 15" minimum diameter discharge pipe within the public right-of-way or public
easement. Use a 12" minimum diameter discharge pipe for other locations.
3) Percolation wells (drywells) are considered an acceptable method of disposing of the
retained runoff when there is no other reasonably accessible discharge method,
subject to the following:
a) Drywells shall penetrate a minimum or ten (10) feet into permeable soil, defined
as mostly cobbles and gravel with no material passing a no. 40 sieve.
b) An actual well test shall be performed, and the resultant design disposal rate shall
not exceed 50% of the rate determined by the test, in order to compensate for
deterioration of percolation rates over time. Only one test will be required if all
Drywells in the area have similar soil boring logs. Copies of any percolation
tests must be submitted to the City.
c) The minimum number of wells per retention/detention basin shall be computed,
and noted in the drainage report.
d) Drywell drilling log(s) and a copy of the completed Drywell registration(s) will
be required before project can be accepted
e) All drywells shall be equipped with a secure grate to prevent unauthorized
removal. Drywell grates shall be installed four (4) inches above finish grade of
the basin bottom.
88
C. Construction Details
All construction shall be per MAG Standard Details and Specifications subject to City of
Douglas modifications. Specifically MAG Standard Detail 404-1 shall be used where any
storm drain encounters a potable water line or pressure main regardless of the contents.

CHAPTER XI: LANDSCAPING
A. Landscape Area Classifications
1. Median & Streetscape Areas.
Medians within Commercial Cores will be allowed a higher percentage of plant coverage with
the plant materials for the area in which they are located.
2. Downtown and Urban Areas.
The Downtown and Urban classification is given to the areas of the City in which pedestrian
comfort is a primary consideration. When designing these areas concentration should be on
elements such as arcaded walkways, shade, decorative paving, and landscaping so that a
comfortable setting can be created for this use-intensive area. The balanced use of plant
material with decorative paving (stamped concrete, exposed aggregate, pavers, etc.) shall be
effectively practiced to minimize the exposure of decomposed granite.
3. Suburban Areas.
The suburban area applies to areas of the City where compatibility should be achieved between
pedestrians and transportation routes within a medium density development pattern. Using
trees that are native and/or desert adapted and which achieve a broad, dense canopy is
encouraged for the main theme of the streetscape. Separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic
can be accomplished through landscape areas and sidewalk alignment. The use of decomposed
granite, exposed aggregate and grouted riprap in place of decorative paving shall be practiced
with plant palette being used to incorporate more arid-type materials and desert adaptability.
4. Transitional Arid Areas.
For areas of the City where the development pattern is medium to low, and the streetscape
serves as a buffer between traffic and adjacent land uses, the transitional arid classification is
applied. Landscape materials should include native plants or plants compatible with a desert
environment. Special care should be given to protect existing vegetation and natural features
that can be incorporated into the design. Handset riprap and decomposed granite shall be the
primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous and desert-compatible
materials.
5. Natural Areas.
A goal of the natural streetscape designation is to keep the streetscape compatible with the
natural desert. For this reason, the design should use plants that are native to the Upper
Sonoran desert and match densities to the existing and adjacent desert environment. Native
stone and indigenous decomposed granite shall be primary inorganic materials with plant
palette consisting of indigenous materials only, and shall conform to the native distribution
patterns, densities and maturity.
97
6. Blending of Abutting Areas.
Where two different landscape areas join, a blending of the two categories should occur to
prevent a marked difference between opposing sides of streets. These guidelines apply to all
landscaped areas within the public rights-of-way. Areas between the rights-of-way and
building setback lines are encouraged to use the guidelines as well. Transitional areas which
abut the natural areas should use native plants as the primary selection in order to strengthen
the tie to the natural desert and to prevent the spread of invasive, non-native species into the
natural areas.
B. Landscape Guidelines
All streetscape designs must meet the following minimum requirements based upon the City’s
ordinances.
1. Maintenance Responsibility.
Maintenance of landscape medians and rights-of-ways will be the responsibility of the
developer, property owner, or a homeowners association for a given period of time (usually 3
years). For a Capital Improvements Project this period of time will be for one year after final
inspection. This period will begin and end following inspections and acceptance of installation
by a representative of Inspection Services and Capital Projects or an owner’s representative
from the City. It is the developer’s responsibility to set up the inspections.
The maintenance responsibility of medians and rights of ways are to be stated on the final
landscape plans submittal. Table 11-1 below shows the standard landscape maintenance block.
Any deviation from this standard requires City approval and shall be defined in a separately
recorded document.
All landscape areas and materials including those located in public rights-of-way shall be
maintained in a healthy, neat, clean and weed-free condition. This shall be the
responsibility of the ________________________________________________________.
(Property Owner, Developer or Homeowner’s Association)
TABLE 11.1 – STANDARD LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE BLOCK
2. Median Widths.
a. Median width is measured from back of median curb to back of median curb (inside to
inside). The minimum width for a median is four (4) feet.
b. Medians less than four (4) feet in width will either be stamped concrete, exposed concrete
or pavers; no plant material will be allowed.
98
3. Placement of Trees and Shrubs.
For planting details of trees, cacti, shrubs, and groundcovers see the most current version of
MAG Specifications and Details for Public Works Construction. Trees should be located so
that the expected mature tree canopy does not ultimately extend into the street right of way.
Consider also the mature tree height and its potentially adverse effects on above-ground
utilities or signage.
4. Tree Quantities and Sizes.
Trees should be provided at the rate of one tree per each thirty five (35) lineal feet of median
length. The minimum size is fifteen (15) gallon with fifty (50) percent to be provided as
mature trees or larger.
5. Grading.
a. Mounding should not be used in areas designated as Downtown and Urban zones. Care
should be taken when designing landscaping within the sight distance triangles. Mounds
within sight distance easements must not exceed a height of eighteen (18) inches as
measured above the final grade elevation. All mounding should blend with the adjacent
existing terrain.
b. The maximum slope of any mounding shall be 4:1 (25%).
c. The finished landscape grade with decomposed granite should be smooth, uniform, and a
minimum of two (2) inches below the top of curb.
6. Decomposed Granite.
a. Size is to be one half (1/2) inch screened.
b. For installation see the most current MAG Specifications and Details for Public Works
Construction.
c. A sample will be submitted to a representative from the Public Works Department for
approval prior to the contractor ordering and bringing it onto the site. Color to match
what exists in the area.
d. Decomposed granite will be distributed uniformly to a depth of two (2) inches covering
the entire landscape area.
7. Boulders.
Boulders are to be reviewed on a case by case basis and approved by the Public Works
Director.
99
8. Plant Selection.
All plant materials used in a median are per the approved selection as listed on the Arizona
Department of Water Resources low water use plant list. The selected plant materials are also
to be consistent with the appropriate character areas and as approved by the Public Works
Director.
C. Irrigation Guidelines
Refer to MAG Section 440 and related details for more specific information.
1. Approved Irrigation System Types.

devices before the City will accept responsibility for maintaining the system.
7. General Irrigation Design Criteria.
a. The irrigation system is to be located entirely within the median. Sleeving from median to
median is acceptable.
b. The contractor is responsible for initiating the account and having the water meter set.
c. Trees and shrubs should be valved separately.
d. The entire irrigation system must be independent of other users, i.e. landscape dedicated
to the City of Douglas for maintenance is to have separate power and water meters from
other irrigation systems.
e. Plans will indicate existing and design operating water pressure requirements.
8. Final Plan Submittal.
Final submittal for irrigation plans must show details for controller, backflow preventer,
enclosures, control valves, wye strainer, pressure regulator, valve boxes, trenching, backfill,
flush caps, and emitters.
D. Sight Distance
Any plant material installed in a questionable area (i.e. safety triangles, sight lines) will be
identified by the Public Works Department and removed by the contractor. Sight distance must
be considered for vehicles entering and exiting the adjacent properties, as well as for vehicles
using the abutting roadways.

NON-CONFORMING LOTS, NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES,
NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES
SECTION 401. GENERAL
Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance there exists certain lots,
structures, and uses of land and structures, which were lawful prior to the effective date
of this ordinance, but which are prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance. Such uses are declared to be non-conforming uses and are incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. Their elimination, as expeditiously as it is
reasonable, is declared to be of as much concern to the public health, safety, and welfare,
as is the prevention of the establishment of new structures and uses that would violate
provisions of this ordinance. It is therefore, the objective of this Ordinance to permit
these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival.
SECTION 402. NON-CONFORMING LOTS
Any legal lot or parcel of record or any lot or parcel in a final subdivision plat or map of
this Ordinance which has an area, width, or depth smaller than the minimum prescribed
by the zoning district in which the lot is located, and any plat or map so approved which
is amended prior to the effective date of this Ordinance is classified as a non-conforming
lot for purposes of this Ordinance.
Section 402.1 Yard Requirements In Effect
The yard requirements in effect for any legal lot or parcel of record or any lot or parcel in
a final subdivision plat or map approved by the City Council prior to the adoption of this
Ordinance are authorized for such lots or parcels in lieu of those prescribed by this
Ordinance.
Section 402.2 Single-Family Dwelling Erection Permitted
The single-family dwelling may be erected on a non-conforming lot or parcel as
described above in districts permitting such uses, provided that:
(a) Such lot or parcel must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots or parcels in the same ownership.
(b) Yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both,
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot or parcel is
located;
4-2 11/27/05
(c) Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall be obtained only through
action of the Board of Adjustment as provided in Article 11.
(d) If two or more lots, or combinations of lots and portions of lots, with continuous
frontage in single ownership are of record, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
requirements for lot width and area established by this Ordinance, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel, and no portion of said
parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements
of this Ordinance, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves
remaining any lot or parcel having width or area which does not meet
requirements of this Ordinance.
SECTION 403. NON-CONFORMIING STRUCTURES
Any structure, or portion thereof, lawfully existing on the effective date of this
Ordinance, which was designed, erected or structurally altered for a use which does not
conform to the regulation of the zoning district in which it is located; or which does not
comply with all the height, setback and area regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located, classified as a non-conforming structure for purposes of this Ordinance.
Section 403.1 Repair or Rebuilding of a Structure
Although the objective is the eventual elimination of non-conforming structures, the
repairing or rebuilding of a nonconforming structure will be allowed on the footprint of
the original structure, or expanding outside the limits of the footprint, as long as it meets
the setback requirements of the zoning district. (Ord. 05-881 § 3, 2005)
Section 403.2 Unexpired Building Permits
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or designated
use of a building for which valid, unexpired building permit has heretofore been issued,
or obtained prior to the effective date of this Ordinance.
SECTION 404. NON-CONFORMING USES OF LAND AND STRUCTURES
Any use of land or a structure lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this
Ordinance, which does not conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located, is classified as a non-conforming use of land or a structure of purposes of this
Ordinance. Such nonconforming use may continue only in the manner and to the extent
it existed at the time it became nonconforming.
Section 404.1 Expansion or Enlargement of Non-Conforming Use
A non-conforming use may be expanded or enlarged to an extent not exceeding 25% of
the land area and/or building ground floor area existing at the time it became non4-
3 11/27/05
conforming; such expansion shall require the approval of the Board of Adjustment but in
no case shall it be greater than 25%.
Section 404.2 Abandonment or Discontinuance of a Non-Conforming Use
Whenever a non-conforming use is abandoned or has been discontinued for a period of
one year, such use shall not thereafter be re-established, and any future uses shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. Once changed to a conforming use, no
structure or land shall be permitted to revert to a non-conforming use. A business license
will serve as prima facie evidence of any operational use.

LANDSCAPING, WALLS, SCREENING AND BUFFERING
SECTION 1801. PURPOSE
This chapter provides standards for landscaping, walls, screening devices and lighting so
as to promote the general welfare of the community. This is accomplished by
encouraging the creation of an attractive appearance as well as screening from view any
and all uses which may be unattractive to public view. Landscaping materials, including
ground covers, shrubs and trees not only improve appearance, but also facilitate control
of erosion, reduction of dust and glare, and visually soften building masses.
Additionally, walls and screening devices allow for separation and aid in buffering
incompatible, unsuitable, and/or unharmonious activities. Used together, landscaping,
walls, screening devices and lighting help insure privacy, aid in promoting logical land
development and enhance property values. For purposes of this article, landscaping
means the combination of elements such as trees, shrubs, ground covers, vines, and other
organic and inorganic material for the express purpose of creating an attractive and
pleasing environment. Water features, plazas, patios, decorative courtyards and lighting
may also be considered landscape elements. Other paved surfaces are not included in the
minimum requirements.
The City encourages the use of low water plant material in such a way that a lush
appearance is presented. Plant material that is high in pollen production is discouraged.
Plants should be placed in such a way as to maximize survivability (i.e., low water-use
plants should not be placed in drainage ways, and the use of frost-tender plants should be
limited to accent locations, not primary focal points). See Section 1806 for
recommended plant list.
Section 1801.1 General Regulations
All new buildings, all new uses of land, and additions of more than 25 percent to existing
buildings and uses in all districts shall comply with this article.
A. Any proposed building or use shall be shown on the site plan indicating the
location of existing and proposed buildings, parking areas, street improvements,
locations and types of landscaped areas, walls and screening devices.
B. Occupancy permits may be issued prior to the complete installation of all required
landscaping if security equal to 110 percent of the cost of plant materials and
labor, as verified by the Director of Public Works, is filed with the City assuring
such installation within six months after occupancy.
C. Security may consist of one of the following: (1) posting of a performance bond
by a qualified surety, (2) establishing a cash trust, said fund to be deposited with
18-2 11/7/03
the City to the credit of the property owner, (3) depositing with the City a
certificate of deposit issued by a banking institution authorized to issue same, or
(4) filing with the City an executed contract of guarantee between the City and a
trust company, banking institution, or other financial institution authorized to
enter into such contracts
D. If the installation of landscaping is not completed within 6 months, the security
may be used by the City to complete the installation. Upon completion of the
installation, any portion of the remaining security deposited with the City shall be
returned.
E. The final landscape inspection shall be made prior to any security being returned.
Any portions of the landscaping not installed, improperly installed, or not
maintained shall cause the inspection to be postponed until the project is
completed or cause the security to be used by the City.
Section 1801.2 Landscaping Design

Landscaped areas shall be reasonably maintained by the owner and/or the lessee of the
property as to pruning, trimming, watering, mulching, weeding, litter removal, aerating,
dethatching turf areas, and/or other requirements to create an attractive and safe
appearance for the development. Clipping and pruning of the plant material are required
to prevent obstructive overhang into walks, curb areas, drives, and line of sight triangles.
Also any areas designated and intended for the purposes of on-site water retention shall
be maintained and reserved for that specific purpose.
Section 1804.5 Landscape Interference.
It is unlawful for any owner or occupier of property to permit any tree, shrub, hedge or
other plant located on the property, or installed on the property, to interfere with the
function of any traffic sign, signal or lighting, or the flow of drainage water on any street,
roadway, easement or other public right-of-way, or the passage of traffic, pedestrian or
vehicular, on any street, sidewalk, roadway or other public right-of-way.
Section 1804. 6 Irrigation Systems
Regular landscape maintenance should ensure water efficiency. Irrigation systems will be
maintained and replaced as necessary to continue to conserve water. Detection and
repair of leaky or broken pipes, valves, and fittings and malfunctioning and/or misaligned
heads, emitters, and bubblers will be part of a regular maintenance program for the site.
Automatic Irrigation Controllers are recommended to be reset a minimum of four (4)
times a year (spring, summer, fall, and winter) to adjust for plant water requirements
which vary according to the season.
Section 1804.7 Replacement of Materials.
The removal or destruction of landscape material, lighting or other material or equipment
required in this section previously approved by the City, as part of the lighting plan,
landscape plan, shall constitute a violation of the zoning regulations. Dead vegetation
shall be promptly replaced, based on standard seasonal planting practices with healthy,
living plants in all required landscaping areas. Replacement of landscape material shall
be of like size as that which was removed or destroyed. Bare soil is not permitted.

Section 1804.8 Violation Notification.
When notified of a violation the owner, owner's association, or the lessee of the site shall
bring into compliance within thirty (30) days said violation in accordance with the
approved site or landscape plan. This will include any landscape areas, irrigation
systems, walls, screening devices, curbing, lighting, material, and other equipment
required in the zoning regulations that does not survive, function properly or is in need of
repair.
SECTION 1805. NATIVE PLANT SALVAGE
Section 1805.1 General requirements
The Arizona Native Plant Law, A.R.S. 3-901 et seq , states that the developer or
contractor shall not deface, injure or destroy certain trees, shrubs or cacti. The developer
or contractor must give the Arizona Department of Agriculture notice prior of any
clearing or grading operations of any residential subdivision, multi-family residential,
commercial or industrial development one acre or larger in size. The developer or
contractor must provide a copy of the notice submitted to the State in compliance with
the Arizona Native Plant Law to the Public Works Director. Arizona native protected
plants, as defined by the statutes, shall not be disturbed without notifying the Arizona
Department of Agriculture pursuant to state law requirements.
SECTION 1806. LOW WATER USE & DROUGHT TOLERANT PLANT
LIST
Section 1806.1 Drought Tolerant Plant List.
These are some of the native and adapted plants which do well at the elevations in
Cochise County (3,500 to 4,500 feet) and are hardy to at least 15°F. Remember that
these plants need regular irrigation while they are being established. After establishment
they can be grown with moderate to no supplemental irrigation. Ask about a plant's
mature size and characteristics to better plan for its location and spacing relative to
buildings, power lines and other plants. In general, native species adapt better to our
desert environment, provide valuable wildlife habitat, and are less susceptible to diseases
than non-native species. Members of the cacti family are not mentioned as they are well
known low water plants, and fire resistant.

B. Platting Procedures and Requirements
1. General
a. Outline of procedures.
Preparation, submission, review and official action concerning all subdivision plats for
locations within the city proceed through the following progressive stages:
1) Preapplication stage;
2) Preliminary plat stage;
3) Final plat stage;
b. Subdivision committee.
A subdivision committee composed of the community development director, City engineer,
and City planner is hereby delegated authority to represent the commission in
preapplication conferences and investigations and to perform such other functions as may
be assigned by the chairman of the commission.
2. Preapplication Stage
a. Generally.
The preapplication stage of subdivision planning comprises an investigatory period
preceding preparation of the preliminary plat. If, during this stage, it is determined that a
change in zoning will be proposed for all or part of the tract, the subdivider should initiate
an application for rezoning simultaneously with submission of the preliminary plat.
b. Actions by the subdivider.
The subdivider shall confer with the committee and present informally a general outline of
his proposal, including but not limited to:
1) Sketch plans and ideas regarding land use, street and lot arrangement, and tentative lot
sizes.
2) Tentative proposals regarding utility and street improvements.
c. Actions by the subdivision committee.
The subdivision committee shall advise the subdivider of procedures, design and
improvements standards and platting requirements. The committee shall investigate the
following aspects of the proposal and report its recommendations to the subdivider:
1) Existing zoning or proposed zoning amendment.
7
2) Adequacy of existing and proposed school, recreation and other public sites.
3) Existing and proposed street and utility systems, existing and proposed uses of
adjoining lands and any special problems such as topography, drainage and flooding.
3. Preliminary Plat Stage
a. Generally.
The preliminary plat stage includes preparation, submission, review and approval of the
preliminary plat. Processing will be expedited by submission of all information essential to
determining the intended character and general acceptability of the proposal.
b. Preliminary plat submission.
1) An application for preliminary plat approval, together with five (5) copies of the
preliminary plat with one (1) copy in electronic format (CD) and one (1) copy in eleven
(11) inch by seventeen (17) inch and required supporting data, prepared in accordance
with section B (3)(f) of this chapter, shall be filed with the City planner. The regular
commission meeting at which the subdivider desires to be heard will be held thirty (30)
days after the committee approves the plat.
2) The preliminary plat shall be designed to meet all requirements of the zoning district in
which it is located; however, in the event that rezoning is deemed necessary, such
application shall accompany submission of preliminary plat. An application for
rezoning may be heard by the commission at the same meeting as the preliminary plat
but shall be acted upon separately. When a preliminary plat constitutes only one unit
of a larger development intended for progressive plating, rezoning shall usually be
limited to the area contained in the first plat.
3) The application shall include payment to the City of the filing fee.
4) If it meets requirements of the Subdivision Code and Engineering Design Standards
Manuel, the application shall be assigned a case number; otherwise, it shall be rejected
and the subdivider notified as to the deficiencies.
c. Preliminary plat review by subdivision committee.
1) The committee shall review the preliminary plat for compliance to provisions of this
chapter and distribute copies of the plat to:
a) The public works director, for review of street plans, drainage, flood control, water
supply and sewage disposal proposals.
b) Superintendents of the elementary and high school districts, for their information.
8
2) The committee shall summarize its recommendations for modifications or change. It
may be sufficiently important to postpone commission action until the problem has been
resolved with the subdivider.
d. Commission hearing and action.
1) If all requirements of this chapter have been met, the commission shall consider the
preliminary plat at a regular meeting within thirty (30) days of the committee’s
approval of the plat.
2) If satisfied that all objectives of these regulations have been met, the commission shall
approve the preliminary plat, and the chairman shall note such approval on three (3)
copies of the plat, returning one to the subdivider, retaining one in the commission
files, and holding one for review by public utilities.
3) If the plat is generally acceptable but requires minor revision before preparation of the
final plat, the commission shall conditionally approve and specify the required
revisions in its meeting minutes.
4) If the commission determines that the plat contains major deficiencies and if the
subdivider agrees to correct such deficiencies, the case may be held over pending
revision, resubmission and reprocessing; otherwise, the preliminary plat shall be
rejected. If the commission rejects the plat, reasons for rejection shall be recorded in
the minutes and therefore, any new filing of a plat for the same tract, or any part
thereof, shall follow normal procedures and be subjected to a new filing fee.
e. Significance of approval.
Approval of a preliminary plat constitutes authorization for the subdivider to proceed with
the preparation of the final plat and engineering plans. Preliminary approval is valid for a
period of eighteen (18) months from date, and may be extended upon written request once
for six (6) months at the discretion of the subdivision committee. The subdivider may
submit the final plat, or any part thereof, on or before the expiration date. If approval
expires prior to filing of the final plat, the preliminary plat shall be resubmitted for approval
as a new case, and a new fee paid. If the subdivision committee’s review of the resubmitted
plat reveals no substantial change from the previously approved preliminary plat, and that
conditions under which previous approval was granted have not changed, the resubmitted
plat shall be scheduled for hearing by the commission at its first regular meeting thereafter.
f. Information required for preliminary plat submission.
1) Preliminary plat information shall be presented on one or more plan sheets with written
date entered directly thereon or contained in letters attached thereto. All mapped data
for the same plat shall be drawn at the same standard engineering scale, said scale

CHAPTER II: STREETS / ROAD DESIGN
A. Street Location and Arrangement
1. Whenever a subdivision embraces any part of a street designated in the adopted major street
plan, such street shall be platted in conformity therewith.
2. Street layout shall provide for the continuation of existing collector streets in adjacent areas,
and such other streets as the Public Works Director may designate.
3. Whenever the tract is located within an area for which a neighborhood plan has been approved
by the Planning & Zoning (P&Z) Commission, the street arrangement shall conform
substantially to that plan.
4. Certain proposed streets, as designated by the P & Z Commission, shall be extended to the
subdivision boundary to provide future connection with adjoining unplatted lands at the full
expense of the Developer.
5. Local streets shall be so arranged as to discourage their use by traffic originating outside the
immediate area.
6. When a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial route, the P & Z
Commission may require marginal access streets or reverse frontage with non-access easements
along the arterial route, or such other treatment as may be justified for protection of properties
from the nuisance and hazard of high volume traffic and for preservation of the traffic function
of the arterial route.
7. When a residential subdivision abuts the right-of-way of a railroad or limited access highway or
abuts a commercial or industrial land use, the Public Works Department may require the
placement of a street approximately parallel to such right-of-way or use at a distance suitable
for appropriate use of intervening land, such distance being determined with due regard for
approach grades, access, drainage, bridges or future grade separations.
8. Streets shall be so arranged in relation to existing topography as to produce desirable lots of
maximum utility and streets of reasonable gradient, and to facilitate adequate drainage.
9. Except where alleys are justified by special conditions, they are not considered appropriate in
residential subdivisions; however, continuation to a logical outlet of an existing dead-end alley
in an adjoining subdivision and the extension of an existing alley pattern where underground
utilities are located in alleys shall be considered justifying conditions. When alleys are platted,
the alley alignment and arrangement shall be such as to provide optimum convenience for truck
service circulation and to avoid alley openings opposite fronts of residential lots. Alleys shall
be required at the rear of multi-family residential, commercial or industrial developments,
except where, in the opinion of the P & Z Commission, other provision is made for adequate
permanent access for purposes of fire protection, parking and loading.
19
10. Half-streets are discouraged except where necessary to provide right-of-way required by the
major street plan, to complete a street pattern already begun, or to ensure reasonable
development of an adjoining unplatted parcel. Where a half-street already exists abutting the
an existing subdivision, then the existing half street must be built to the full build-out street
section and at the full expense of the Developer.
11. Street sections shall be constructed to minimum pavement requirements as stated in these
design guidelines. Additional paving sections may be required by the soils report.

E. Paving Requirements – Technical Specifications
1. City of Douglas Asphalt and Paving Policy:
The City of Douglas is willing under certain circumstances to sell asphalt to residents and
contractors within Arizona and a twenty five (25) mile radius of the corporate limits of the City
of Douglas. This willingness stems from (1) the need to support the public good of improving
off-street parking opportunities within the above stated area through a reduction of traffic
congestion, (2) improving dust control, and drainage control, (3) minimizing erosion, and (4)
promoting of vehicle/pedestrian safety. The Mayor and Council must authorize the sale of
asphalt of over 200 tons to residents or contractors doing work within a 25-mile radius of the
corporate limits of the City, within the United States. Any amount under 200 tons per purchase
may be approved by the City Manager until total sales during the prior 12 months to the same
person or entity have exceeded 3000 tons. At that time the Council must approve future
requests. The City Manager may authorize up to 200 tons per purchase to the City of Agua
Prieta, State of Sonora, or Country of Mexico provided said asphalt is to be used by these
public agencies within a 25-mile radius of Douglas. In the event sales exceed 3000 tons in a
12-month period, the agency’s request will be taken to the Mayor and Council for
consideration.
Such material sales are authorized only at such time as the asphalt plant is operating and only to
the extent that excess material over that needed for City projects can be reasonably produced.
All material purchases must be picked up by the purchaser at the City asphalt plant.
The price of the asphalt sold by the City shall be established at the average market price in
effect and charged by private enterprises in Cochise County within 10 days of the order for pick
up at the place of business of the private enterprise or at a price specified by the Mayor and
Council.
There also may be occasions that the City is requested to perform paving services along with
the sale of asphalt. This practice will be limited to churches and qualified private non-profit
organizations or corporations operating within the corporate limits of the City of Douglas. This
service will be performed only if approved by the Council and is determined to be for the
public benefit by providing dust control, improving drainage and minimizing property
deterioration, reducing standing water, and creating safer properties by promoting
vehicle/pedestrian safety.
A church or qualified non-profit organization or corporation must file a written request with the
City Manager for paving or repaving of a lot. The request must include the size of the lot to be
paved and the thickness of asphalt needed. Staff will present the cost of the paving when the
council considers the request for paving services. The cost will include equipment charges,
labor rate, and material. All charges will be charged at a rate as specified by the Mayor and
Council at the time of approval. Labor will be charged at the hourly rate of the employee
including all fringe benefit costs associated. Material will be charged as described above under
material purchases. If the City Council approves the request, the paving will be scheduled into
the Department of Public Works paving schedule. Paving will commence within the 120 days
of approval as long as City equipment is in proper working order. All payments for material
and services must be paid in advance, unless the Mayor and Council or City Manager approves
29
a payment plan. When paving services are provided, the applicant must provide written
agreement to pay for all actual increases in component costs for labor, equipment or materials
beyond that approved by the Council when those increases occur between the approval date and
actual installation date.
Pavement Cuts
There is a five (5) year moratorium on pavement cuts from the time asphalt concrete is placed
in that specific location. There will be instances when, due to an emergency situation, the
pavement must be cut to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. In these
cases, the Director of Public Works can give approval of such pavement cuts.
This policy is intended to discourage pavement cuts beyond the five-year moratorium. All
other options must be considered including but not limited to boring under the street and
rerouting around the street.
Prior to any pavement cuts, a right-of-way permit must be obtained from the Department of
Public Works.

45
CHAPTER VI: STREETS / SIGNALS
A. Design
1. Signal design requirements and guidelines shall be in accordance with the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (M.U.T.C.D.), Chapter 4 (2003 Edition).
B. City Traffic Signal Definitions, Warrants & Design References
1. Definition.
A traffic control signal (traffic signal) shall be defined as any highway traffic signal by which
traffic is alternately directed to stop and permitted to proceed.
Traffic shall be defined as pedestrians, bicyclists, ridden or herded animals, vehicles, streetcars,
and other conveyances either singularly or together while using any highway for purposes of
travel.
Standards for traffic control signals are important because traffic control signals need to attract
the attention of a variety of road users, including those who are older, those with impaired
vision, as well as those who are fatigued or distracted, or who are not expecting to encounter a
signal at a particular location.
2. Engineering Studies.
The selection and use of traffic control signals should be based on an engineering study of
roadway, traffic, and other conditions. A careful analysis of traffic operations, pedestrian and
bicyclist needs, and other factors at a large number of signalized and unsignalized locations,
coupled with engineering judgment, has provided a series of signal warrants that define the
minimum conditions under which installing traffic control signals might be justified.
Engineering judgment should be applied in the review of operating traffic control signals to
determine whether the type of installation and the timing program meet the current requirements
of all forms of traffic.
3. Warrants.
An engineering study of traffic conditions, pedestrian characteristics, and physical
characteristics of the location shall be performed to determine whether installation of a traffic
control signal is justified at a particular location.
The investigation of the need for a traffic control signal shall include an analysis of the
applicable factors contained in the following traffic signal warrants and other factors related to
existing operation and safety at the study location:
46
Warrant 1, Eight-Hour Vehicular Volume.
Warrant 2, Four-Hour Vehicular Volume.
Warrant 3, Peak Hour.
Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume.
Warrant 5, School Crossing.
Warrant 6, Coordinated Signal System.
Warrant 7, Crash Experience.
Warrant 8, Roadway Network.
The satisfaction of a traffic signal warrant or warrants shall not in itself require the installation
of a traffic control signal.
4. Design References.
a. Traffic Impact Analysis. A Traffic Impact Analysis in accordance with the Arizona
Department of Transportation (ADOT) Traffic Impact Analysis criteria shall be submitted
for all new developments generating one hundred (100) or more peak hour trips. Use the
most current Version of Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation
manual to determine peak hour trip estimates.
b. Signal Modifications. Signal modifications that are a result of street widening or
recommended in the Traffic Impact Analysis related to the development are the
responsibility of the Developer.
c. Signal Conduit. Signal conduit with pull boxes shall be provided at all major arterial,
minor arterial and collector street intersections as shown in ADOT’s Specification and
Standard Drawings.
d. Specifications and Details. Traffic signals shall be designed in accordance with the
ADOT Traffic Signals and Lighting Specification and Standard Drawings.
5. Traffic Signal Equipment.
a. Traffic signal poles and hardware shall conform to the ADOT standards and shall be
approved through the Electrical Equipment Submittal process.
b. Traffic signal cabinets and controller/electronic equipment shall be selected from the City
of Douglas approved Traffic signal cabinets and controller/electronic equipment list.
Traffic signal cabinets and controller/electronic equipment shall be approved through
ADOT’s Electrical Equipment Submittal process.

a. The minimum standards for Water Distribution pipe sizing as follows:
Description Size
Residential Street 6”
Commercial/Industrial/Collector (1/2 mile streets) 8”
Major Arterials or Section Line Streets 12”
b. Mains designed as single feed systems with fire hydrants shall be a minimum of eight (8)
inch diameter. An eight (8) inch diameter main configured as a looped system with two
(2) feeds can serve up to six (6) fire hydrants. Fire hydrant source water shall be from a
minimum eight (8) inch diameter main.
c. Eight (8) inch diameter water main is permitted only in cul-de-sacs of three hundred fifty
(350) feet or less with fewer than ten (10) services.
2. Pipe materials shall be as specified in the City of Tucson Standard Specifications & Details
(2001 Edition) with the following exception: To provide reliable water service, and minimize
City maintenance activities on private property, public piping within easements (outside
dedicated streets), normally located in shopping centers, industrial developments and
commercial/apartment complexes, shall be ductile iron or PVC (AWWA C-900, class 150).
All service piping for meters, three (3) inch and larger, shall be ductile iron. PVC greater than
twelve (12) inch shall be C-900 / Class 150 with mechanical joint fitting.
3. Pipe locations, where possible, shall follow the standard locations in streets established by the
Public Works Director. A six (6) foot minimum horizontal separation from any parallel

conflict review will be required with approval by the Public Works Director as well.
52
4. Fire line (private hydrants and building sprinkler) connections may be part of the mainline
water construction plan if properly approved drawings for these services are available at the
time of plan review.
5. Backflow Prevention. Back-flow prevention may be required on potable water supply lines to
prevent the possibility that the main potable water supply may become polluted or
contaminated. This type of protection is called containment or secondary protection and is
placed as close as possible to the water meter for domestic, landscape or any other use, and
near the property line for a fire sprinkler system. If water is used for anything other than
bathroom and drinking fountains a back-flow preventer may be required before a certificate of
occupancy is granted.
a. Internal or primary protection will be covered by the plumbing code during the plans
review process. Internal protection requires the same installation and testing as
containment protection.
b. All commercial/industrial landscape sprinkler systems require a reduced pressure zone
(RP) back-flow preventer to be installed and tested as above.
c. Class 1 & 2 fire systems are not required at this time to have back-flow protection. Fire
sprinkler systems must be sized to allow for a ten-pound head loss plus the loss for all
elbows and risers.

CHAPTER IX: SANITARY SEWERS
A. General
1. These standards establish a uniform engineering approach for determining wastewater flow
generation rates and minimum criteria for design of public wastewater systems. The standards
are structured to accommodate designers who are preparing construction plans for private
development. These standards set forth the minimum criteria for design of such sanitary
sewage facilities but are not intended to cover all situations that may arise or substitute for
sound engineering judgment.
2. New public sanitary sewage facilities shall be designed in accordance with the City of Douglas
Public Works Department standard specifications, MAG standard specifications and details
and/or Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) 18-9 and Arizona Departments of Environmental
Quality Bulletin No. 11.
3. No upstream sewer construction shall start until the downstream sewer main is completed and
approved by the City. Pipe laying shall commence at the proposed outfall to the existing City
sewer.
4. Developer shall be responsible to assure that all sewer lines not in service be plugged to ensure
that no inflow be diverted to an existing sewer service line.
B. General
1. The average flow factors are identified here as a guide to ensure adequate sewer capacity is
available. These factors may be modified to be more site specific if greater precision is
requested by the Public Works Department.
2. Design of sewer mains and appurtenances shall be based on the following:
a. The peak day flow.
b. The minimum allowable flow velocity of two (2) fps. (pipe flowing full).
c. The maximum allowable flow velocity of eight (8) fps. (pipe flowing full).
3. For sewer mains less than twelve (12) inches in diameter, the peak daily flow can be assumed
as four (4) times the average daily flow. For sewer mains twelve (12) inches or larger in
diameter, the peak daily flow is assumed as two point five (2.5) times the average daily flow.
4. Average daily flow factors are as listed in Table IV below.

extent, location and capacity of drainage facilities shall be determined for the individual
subdivision by the Public Works Director and shall be constructed accordingly. Where storm
water is discharged into any outlet not directly controlled by the City, the subdivider shall
submit satisfactory evidence that the use of such outlet is approved by the owner custodian
designee.
2. Design Requirement for Storm Drainage.
All developments within the City shall provide such storm drainage facilities as are necessary
to insure that all improvements, structures and properties, both within the subject development
and those located upstream and downstream of the development, shall be protected from the
adverse impact of storm water due to the proposed development.
A Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan shall be required of all development/construction
projects unless determined to be non-applicable by the Director of Public Works. Each
development shall comply, as a minimum, with NPDES notification to the EPA and
implementation of SWPPP control measures, as defined and required by the “Best Management
Practices” of the City of Douglas.
3. System Classification.
a. The "Minor System" (10-year) shall consist of those collection and/or retention/detention
facilities necessary to collect, convey, retain and/or detain storm water runoff from the
more frequent rainfalls. The "Minor System" shall be designed to accommodate storms
up to and including a "ten (10) year storm" and shall be used only when specifically
approved by the Public Works Director.
b. The "Major System" (100-year storm of duration) shall consist of those facilities
necessary to convey storm water runoff from storms up to and including a "one-hundred
year storm." It consists primarily of the planning and/or analysis of the overall drainage
system to insure: that there is always positive drainage from all areas, that the "onehundred
year" flows can safely pass through the project, and that all structures are above
the one hundred (100) year water elevation in areas where temporary and/or long duration
ponding may occur as well as those areas lying within the FEMA floodplain.
4. Drainage Facilities Components.
a. Collection System. This portion of the system is intended to collect and convey runoff to
either retention/detention, trunk line storm drain facilities and/or outfall into natural and
man-made drainage channel facilities.
83
b. Retention/Detention Facilities. This portion of the system is intended to retain/detain
sufficient volumes of runoff to minimize the adverse impact of new developments on
downstream areas. All developments must provide retention/detention facilities.
5. Reports.
a. Drainage Report. A drainage report is a report that is required for any site greater than one
(1) acre in size or for any site subject to detention requirements. The drainage report shall
contain all elements of a hydrology report, as well as descriptive data of the appropriate
components for the required detention facility design. In addition, a drainage report shall
be required for any site where extensive structural improvements for mitigating drainage
impacts are required.
b. Hydrology Report. A hydrology report is a report required for developments which are
not subject to detention requirements, nor which require extensive structural
improvements for handling drainage; but which are impacted by flows from significant
watercourses and/or affected by 100-year flows of 500 cfs, or more. The objective of a
hydrology report is to establish finished-floor elevations, which assure that all structures
are free from flooding during a regulatory flood. Additional objectives of a hydrology
report are to establish the size and configuration of flow-through wall openings and other
minor drainage features; and, if required by the Public Works Director, to develop a
grading plan which demonstrates adequate site drainage with no resulting impact to
upstream or downstream properties.
c. The review and approval of drainage reports, hydrology reports, and drainage statements
by the Public Works Director are typically in response to reports and statements submitted
in order to satisfy one of the following: (1) a requirement of rezoning; (2) a specific
requirement for approval of a subdivision plat or a development plan; (3) approval of a
disclosure statement prepared in conjunction with a condominium conversion; (4) the
request for a floodplain, building, or grading permit for a parcel located within either a
regulatory floodplain, an erosion/building-setback zone, or an identified flood-hazard
area; or (5) application for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) or a Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
B. Design
1. Finish Floor Elevations.
a. Finish floor (FF) elevations shall be a minimum of twelve (12) inches above the
calculated one hundred (100) year storm event elevation.
b. Per individual lot, finish floor elevations shall not be less than fourteen (14) inches above
the low top of curb elevation nor less than six (6) inches above the high top of curb
elevation of the subject lot.
84
c. For manufactured homes or trailers, the lot pad elevation shall be used in lieu of a fixed
finished floor elevation.
2. Street Drainage.
a. The basis of design for local streets shall be designed to carry the ten (10) year storm
being contained within the pavement section with a maximum depth of six (6) inches.
b. Streets shall be designed to carry the following minimum flows:
1) Major and minor arterial streets to carry a ten (10) year flow between the curbs and
maintain a twelve-foot dry lane in each direction; and carry the one hundred (100)
year flow within the right-of-way with a maximum depth of six (6) inches over the
crown of the street, for emergency vehicles and evacuation purposes.
2) Collectors and local streets shall be designed to carry ten (10) year flows between the
curbs, the fifty (50) year flows between the property lines, and the one hundred (100)
year flow within the right-of-way. The grading plans must substantiate the flow
containment capability.
3) Underground storm drains are required when the above street capacity or maximum
depth is exceeded.
3. Underground Storm Drains.
a. Underground storm drains shall be provided whenever the capacity of the pavement
section or maximum depth is exceeded by the design storm event.
b. Pipes shall be sized using "Manning's Formula". Values of Manning's "n" shall be from
appropriate technical literature and shall be referenced.
c. Velocities shall range from three (3) feet per second to nine (9) feet per second in order to
prevent sedimentation and abrasion damage.
d. The minimum pipe size shall be fifteen (15) inch ID, RGRCP class IV minimum in the
right-of-way or easement maintained by the City.
e. The hydraulic grade line (HGL) for the design storm may be above the pipe, provided that
it remains at least one (1) foot below the ground elevation at all manholes, catch basins,
inlets, etc., the pipe shall be designed to operate with the calculated head pressure
provided the HGL does not compromise the operation of the storm drain system. The
HGL shall be provided on the profile portion of the storm drain plan and profile.
f. When the pipe changes direction more than 30 degrees there shall be manhole installed
with a drop, between match points, of at least 0.1 feet. In no case shall the deflection
angle be greater than 90 degrees.
g. Pipe and culverts installed in City easements and rights-of-way shall be bedded from
85
bottom of excavation to one (1) foot above the pipe with granular bedding material in
accordance with the requirements of Section 601.4.6 of MAG Uniform Standard
Specifications, or the manufacturer’s recommendations, whichever is more restrictive.
Bedding compaction densities shall be per MAG Specification Table 601-2. The initial
4” bedding under the pipe is required for pipe having an inside diameter of 12" or larger,
and in all cases where rock larger than 1-1/2" is encountered in the trench bottom, the
requirements of MAG Standard Specification 601.2.5 shall apply. Specially designed and
alternate bedding will be approved on a case by case basis.
h. Minimum trench backfill requirements shall be per MAG Specification 601.4, with
compaction densities per MAG Specification Table 601-2. Backfill requirements
provided by the Project/Design Engineer shall apply, when such provisions are more
restrictive than MAG Specification.
4. Retention/Detention Basins.
a. Basis of Design. All retention/detention facilities shall be sized to retain 100% of the one
hundred (100) year, six (6) hour storm falling over the entire project site including the
total adjacent right(s)-of-way. For the purpose of determining the volume required, the
project shall be considered to extend to the centerline of all existing and future streets on
the exterior boundaries and to include all interior streets and other rights-of-way within
the project.
b. Freeboard. There shall be a one (1) foot freeboard from the basin overflow water surface
elevation to the lowest adjacent building elevation and/or equal to the gutter of the
upstream streets. The freeboard for all project building floor elevations shall be a
minimum of fourteen (14) inches above the project outfall water surface elevation.
c. Volume. The following data shall be provided for each retention/detention basin:
1) Volume Required. The volume required in cubic feet shall be computed using the
City’s developments as urban with respect to percentage of impervious cover.
2) Volume Provided. The volume provided shall be submitted in a table noting the
stage-capacity relationships. All basins shall be sized to retain the calculated required
volume within the first three (3) feet of elevation. Calculated required volume (Vr) is
defined as:
Vr = CPA
12 where C = roughness coefficient
P = precipitation
A = area, in square feet
For compliance, Vr is compared to actual basin incremental volume at the three (3)
foot basin level.
d. Retention/Detention basins shall be located such that they can intercept the flows from the
entire site. If portions of the project cannot drain to the primary basin, additional basins
86
shall be added to retain/detain runoff from these areas.
e. The sub-drainage areas for each basin shall be denoted on the plans and the calculations
for each sub-basin retention/detention required, shall be provided. Overflow from any
sub-basin may be safely routed to another sub-basin, to ultimately be contained in the
compilation of retention/detention provided.
f. The High Water Level (HWL) shall be denoted on the plans for each basin or ponding
area. The basin depth (overall average depth) shall be measured from the lowest point to
the elevation of the basin overflow. This is not to be considered the water surface
elevation of the basin’s retention depth (HWL) for the period storm event.
g. The Outfall elevation and each basin Overflow elevation shall be shown on the plans.
h. The overall average depth shall not exceed three (3) feet without authorization of the
Public Works Director. At the City's option, the basin may be fenced to allow steeper side
slopes or greater depths. In no case shall the depth exceed one (1) foot without a positive
means (not relying on evaporation) of disposing of accumulated runoff.
i. The bottom of all basins shall be sloped towards the discharge points. The minimum
bottom slope shall be 0.1%.
j. Side Slopes.
1) Side slopes adjacent to public rights-of-way, or when there is pedestrian type access
to that portion of the basin, shall have a side slope of 6:1 or flatter. There shall be at
least two (2) feet of level ground between the back of the sidewalk and the beginning
of the side slope grading.
2) Side slopes adjacent to walls, fences, and hedges, etc. (i.e., no or limited pedestrian
type access in that area) may have side slopes up to 4:1 if adjacent to public right-ofway
or easement and 3:1 if adjacent to private property. There shall be at least two
(2) feet of level ground adjacent from any wall or vertical obstruction to the top of the
side slope grading.
3) The following depth/side slope criteria may be used as approved by the Public Works
Director:
Basin Depth (feet) Side Slope
< 4 4:1
4-6 6:1
6-9 10:1
> 9 14:1
k. In the event project basins fail and over top, runoff shall be routed towards an outfall
point. Each subdivision shall be designed such that the "ultimate" outfall for all drainage
is a public street, storm drain, drainage channel or natural watercourse. The outfall shall
be accessible without draining over private property. Design engineers must evaluate
87
cases where project outfall conditions occur and take necessary actions to prevent
flooding or damage to properties located downstream of the outfall. Additionally, all
project site finished floors must be a minimum of fourteen inches (14”) above the outfall
water surface elevation.
l. All retention/detention facilities shall have a positive method of disposing of retained or
detained runoff waters. 100% of the 100 year 6 hour storm being retained/detained shall
be disposed of within 36 hours. Public streets are not considered to be an acceptable
outlet for disposal of retained or detained runoff. However, streets are considered an
acceptable outlet for the conveyance of basin overflow or project outfall.
m. Acceptable methods of disposal of accumulated storm water runoff are:
1) A bleed-off discharge to an existing storm drain or drainage channel of sufficient
capacity to convey the anticipated flows from the tributary drainage area after the
storm.
2) The maximum bleed-off discharge rate shall be 1 cfs. This rate can be achieved by
the addition of a 6" diameter hole in a plate mounted on the discharge structure. Use
a 15" minimum diameter discharge pipe within the public right-of-way or public
easement. Use a 12" minimum diameter discharge pipe for other locations.
3) Percolation wells (drywells) are considered an acceptable method of disposing of the
retained runoff when there is no other reasonably accessible discharge method,
subject to the following:
a) Drywells shall penetrate a minimum or ten (10) feet into permeable soil, defined
as mostly cobbles and gravel with no material passing a no. 40 sieve.
b) An actual well test shall be performed, and the resultant design disposal rate shall
not exceed 50% of the rate determined by the test, in order to compensate for
deterioration of percolation rates over time. Only one test will be required if all
Drywells in the area have similar soil boring logs. Copies of any percolation
tests must be submitted to the City.
c) The minimum number of wells per retention/detention basin shall be computed,
and noted in the drainage report.
d) Drywell drilling log(s) and a copy of the completed Drywell registration(s) will
be required before project can be accepted
e) All drywells shall be equipped with a secure grate to prevent unauthorized
removal. Drywell grates shall be installed four (4) inches above finish grade of
the basin bottom.
88
C. Construction Details
All construction shall be per MAG Standard Details and Specifications subject to City of
Douglas modifications. Specifically MAG Standard Detail 404-1 shall be used where any
storm drain encounters a potable water line or pressure main regardless of the contents.

CHAPTER XI: LANDSCAPING
A. Landscape Area Classifications
1. Median & Streetscape Areas.
Medians within Commercial Cores will be allowed a higher percentage of plant coverage with
the plant materials for the area in which they are located.
2. Downtown and Urban Areas.
The Downtown and Urban classification is given to the areas of the City in which pedestrian
comfort is a primary consideration. When designing these areas concentration should be on
elements such as arcaded walkways, shade, decorative paving, and landscaping so that a
comfortable setting can be created for this use-intensive area. The balanced use of plant
material with decorative paving (stamped concrete, exposed aggregate, pavers, etc.) shall be
effectively practiced to minimize the exposure of decomposed granite.
3. Suburban Areas.
The suburban area applies to areas of the City where compatibility should be achieved between
pedestrians and transportation routes within a medium density development pattern. Using
trees that are native and/or desert adapted and which achieve a broad, dense canopy is
encouraged for the main theme of the streetscape. Separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic
can be accomplished through landscape areas and sidewalk alignment. The use of decomposed
granite, exposed aggregate and grouted riprap in place of decorative paving shall be practiced
with plant palette being used to incorporate more arid-type materials and desert adaptability.
4. Transitional Arid Areas.
For areas of the City where the development pattern is medium to low, and the streetscape
serves as a buffer between traffic and adjacent land uses, the transitional arid classification is
applied. Landscape materials should include native plants or plants compatible with a desert
environment. Special care should be given to protect existing vegetation and natural features
that can be incorporated into the design. Handset riprap and decomposed granite shall be the
primary inorganic materials with plant palette consisting of indigenous and desert-compatible
materials.
5. Natural Areas.
A goal of the natural streetscape designation is to keep the streetscape compatible with the
natural desert. For this reason, the design should use plants that are native to the Upper
Sonoran desert and match densities to the existing and adjacent desert environment. Native
stone and indigenous decomposed granite shall be primary inorganic materials with plant
palette consisting of indigenous materials only, and shall conform to the native distribution
patterns, densities and maturity.
97
6. Blending of Abutting Areas.
Where two different landscape areas join, a blending of the two categories should occur to
prevent a marked difference between opposing sides of streets. These guidelines apply to all
landscaped areas within the public rights-of-way. Areas between the rights-of-way and
building setback lines are encouraged to use the guidelines as well. Transitional areas which
abut the natural areas should use native plants as the primary selection in order to strengthen
the tie to the natural desert and to prevent the spread of invasive, non-native species into the
natural areas.
B. Landscape Guidelines
All streetscape designs must meet the following minimum requirements based upon the City’s
ordinances.
1. Maintenance Responsibility.
Maintenance of landscape medians and rights-of-ways will be the responsibility of the
developer, property owner, or a homeowners association for a given period of time (usually 3
years). For a Capital Improvements Project this period of time will be for one year after final
inspection. This period will begin and end following inspections and acceptance of installation
by a representative of Inspection Services and Capital Projects or an owner’s representative
from the City. It is the developer’s responsibility to set up the inspections.
The maintenance responsibility of medians and rights of ways are to be stated on the final
landscape plans submittal. Table 11-1 below shows the standard landscape maintenance block.
Any deviation from this standard requires City approval and shall be defined in a separately
recorded document.
All landscape areas and materials including those located in public rights-of-way shall be
maintained in a healthy, neat, clean and weed-free condition. This shall be the
responsibility of the ________________________________________________________.
(Property Owner, Developer or Homeowner’s Association)
TABLE 11.1 – STANDARD LANDSCAPE MAINTENANCE BLOCK
2. Median Widths.
a. Median width is measured from back of median curb to back of median curb (inside to
inside). The minimum width for a median is four (4) feet.
b. Medians less than four (4) feet in width will either be stamped concrete, exposed concrete
or pavers; no plant material will be allowed.
98
3. Placement of Trees and Shrubs.
For planting details of trees, cacti, shrubs, and groundcovers see the most current version of
MAG Specifications and Details for Public Works Construction. Trees should be located so
that the expected mature tree canopy does not ultimately extend into the street right of way.
Consider also the mature tree height and its potentially adverse effects on above-ground
utilities or signage.
4. Tree Quantities and Sizes.
Trees should be provided at the rate of one tree per each thirty five (35) lineal feet of median
length. The minimum size is fifteen (15) gallon with fifty (50) percent to be provided as
mature trees or larger.
5. Grading.
a. Mounding should not be used in areas designated as Downtown and Urban zones. Care
should be taken when designing landscaping within the sight distance triangles. Mounds
within sight distance easements must not exceed a height of eighteen (18) inches as
measured above the final grade elevation. All mounding should blend with the adjacent
existing terrain.
b. The maximum slope of any mounding shall be 4:1 (25%).
c. The finished landscape grade with decomposed granite should be smooth, uniform, and a
minimum of two (2) inches below the top of curb.
6. Decomposed Granite.
a. Size is to be one half (1/2) inch screened.
b. For installation see the most current MAG Specifications and Details for Public Works
Construction.
c. A sample will be submitted to a representative from the Public Works Department for
approval prior to the contractor ordering and bringing it onto the site. Color to match
what exists in the area.
d. Decomposed granite will be distributed uniformly to a depth of two (2) inches covering
the entire landscape area.
7. Boulders.
Boulders are to be reviewed on a case by case basis and approved by the Public Works
Director.
99
8. Plant Selection.
All plant materials used in a median are per the approved selection as listed on the Arizona
Department of Water Resources low water use plant list. The selected plant materials are also
to be consistent with the appropriate character areas and as approved by the Public Works
Director.
C. Irrigation Guidelines
Refer to MAG Section 440 and related details for more specific information.
1. Approved Irrigation System Types.
Drip system using rigid laterals.
2. Controllers.
Place controllers in the center of the median, a minimum of twenty (20) feet before the
beginning of the turn bay.
3. Power Source.
a. The contractor is responsible for initiating account and service connection.
b. If the power source cannot be placed within the median or the rights-of-way, a utility
easement must be provided. This location is to be indicated and noted on the final
irrigation plans and also inside of the controller cabinet.
4. Water Source.
a. Show both the water source and location of the proposed tap on the final irrigation plans.
b. Contact the Public Works Department for information on tapping into City waterlines.
c. The minimum source pressure required to operate the system must be noted on plans.
d. The water meter should be located within a median wherever possible.
5. Remote Control Electric Valves.
a. Valves are to be of brass construction, and a minimum size of one (1) inch.
b. An approved valve is Rainbird series GB or equivalent.
c. Full Port ball valves or equivalent must be installed in front of all control valves.
d. All direct buried control valve wiring shall be a minimum fourteen (14) gauge.
100
6. Back Flow Prevention Devices.
a. Only reduced pressure assemblies will be used.
b. All backflow prevention devices will have a security enclosure.
c. A certified tester, recognized by the City of Douglas, must test backflow prevention
devices before the City will accept responsibility for maintaining the system.
7. General Irrigation Design Criteria.
a. The irrigation system is to be located entirely within the median. Sleeving from median to
median is acceptable.
b. The contractor is responsible for initiating the account and having the water meter set.
c. Trees and shrubs should be valved separately.
d. The entire irrigation system must be independent of other users, i.e. landscape dedicated
to the City of Douglas for maintenance is to have separate power and water meters from
other irrigation systems.
