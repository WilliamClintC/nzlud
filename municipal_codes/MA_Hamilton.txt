CHAPTER I
TOWN MEETING
SECTION 1: Manner in which Town Meetings are to be called.
a. WARRANTS: Every town meeting shall be called pursuant to a warrant issued by the Board of Selectmen which shall state the time and place at which the meeting is to convene and the subjects which are to be acted upon.
b. NOTIFICATION: The Board of Selectmen shall cause attested copies of the warrant for each town meeting to be posted, one at the Town Hall, one at each of the Post Offices, and one at the Police/Fire Station in Hamilton at least seven (7) days before the Annual Town Meeting in the Spring and fourteen (14) days before any special town meeting and the regularly scheduled Town Meeting in the Fall of each year;. Such posting shall be deemed to be the legal notification of such meeting, and the legal service of such warrant.
SECTION 2: Time of Meetings
a. GENERAL: The town shall meet in regular meetings twice each calendar year,and in special meetings, at such times as the Board of Selectmen may direct, or as otherwise provided by law.
b. MEETING DATES: “The Spring Town meeting, which shall be the Annual Town Meeting for purposes of General Laws, Chapter 39, Section 9, shall include the adoption of an annual budget and other warrant articles, and shall meet, except for the election of Town Officers, on the first Saturday of April in each year at 9:00 in the morning, unless the Selectmen vote to establish another date in order to suit the public convenience for reasons the Selectmen shall determine including, but not limited to, conflicts with the observance of holidays. That date must be a Saturday. If the business of the Annual Town Meeting is not completed on the first day, it may be adjourned from time to time. A regular Fall Town Meeting shall meet at a time designated by the Board of Selectmen, usually the third Saturday in October.”
c. ELECTION OF TOWN OFFICERS: The election of town officers shall be held on the first Thursday after the opening of the Annual Town Meeting. The Selectmen may upon the recommendation of the Town Clerk change the date of the election to either of the next two succeeding Thursdays. The polls for the election of said town officers shall be opened at 7:00 o’clock a.m. and shall close at 8:00 o’clock p.m.
SECTION 3. Quorum
Seventy-five (75) legal voters shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Town Meeting. Seventy-five (75) legal voters shall constitute a quorum at all other Regular and Special Town Meetings.
- 12 -
CHAPTER II
RULES AND PROCEDURE OF TOWN MEETINGS
SECTION 1.All articles in the warrant shall be taken up in the order of their arrangement, unless otherwise decided by a two-thirds vote, except that unanimous consent shall be required for inclusion of an Article in a “Consent Motion” group of Articles that will be taken up by the meeting for voting on the group.
SECTION 2. In case of motions to amend, or to fill out blanks, the one expressing the largest sum of the longest time shall be put first, and an affirmative vote thereon shall be a negative vote on any smaller sum or shorter time.
SECTION 3. The report of a committee shall be deemed properly before a meeting if a request for its acceptance is included in an article of the warrant and a copy is published in the Annual Report or is filed with the Town Clerk fifteen days prior to the meeting. A vote to accept a final report shall discharge the committee but shall not be equivalent to a vote to carry out its recommendations. A vote on recommendations included in a committee report shall only be in order under an article to that effect in the warrant. A vote to accept a report of progress shall continue the committee under its original authority unless otherwise specified.
SECTION 4. If an article of the Warrant has once been acted upon and disposed of, it shall not be again considered at the meeting except by a two-thirds vote.

Moreover, nothing in this Right to Farm By-Law shall be deemed as acquiring any interest in land, or as imposing any new land use regulation, but neither does it supersede or overrule any other requirements or restrictions on the use of land for the purposes covered hereby, whether by state, regulation or local by-law.

- 56 -
may include, but are not limited to, activities that cause noise, dust and odors.

CHAPTER XXIX
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
- 57 -
1. PURPOSE AND INTENT:
The purpose and intent of this bylaw are to:
A. protect water resources
B. require practices that mitigate soil erosion and sedimentation and control the volume and rate of stormwater runoff resulting from land disturbance activities;
C. promote infiltration and the recharge of groundwater; D. ensure that soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and stormwater runoff control practices are incorporated into the site planning and design process, and are implemented and maintained; E. encourage the use of Low-Impact Development practices such as reducing impervious cover and the preservation of green space and other natural areas, to the maximum extent practicable;
F. comply with state and federal statutes and regulations relating to stormwater discharges;
G. establish the Town of Hamilton as the legal authority to ensure compliance with the provisions of this by-law through inspection, monitoring, and enforcement.
2. DEFINITIONS ABUTTER: The owner(s) of land abutting the legal boundaries of the land on which the land-disturbing activity is proposed.

8. Preservation of Historically Significant Buildings
Purpose and Intent
This bylaw is adopted for the purpose of preserving and protecting significant historic buildings, as defined herein, within the Town of Hamilton and encouraging owners of such buildings to seek out alternatives so as to preserve, rehabilitate, or restore such buildings rather than to demolish them or alter them in a detrimental way. Such buildings constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, economic, agricultural, political, or social history of the Town. Further, through the bylaw, residents of the Town are alerted to impending demolition or alteration of significant buildings. By preserving and protecting significant buildings, streetscapes, landscapes and neighborhoods, this bylaw promotes the public welfare by making the Town a more attractive and desirable community.
To achieve these purposes, the Hamilton Historic District Commission, exercising its powers and duties as the Historical Commission, shall advise the Building Inspector with respect to applications for demolition permits, as defined herein. The issuance of demolition permits is regulated as provided by this bylaw.
Definitions – As used throughout this bylaw, the terms defined below have the following meanings:
- 76 -
APPLICANT - Any person or entity who files an application for a demolition permit. If the applicant is not the owner of the premises upon which the building is situated, the owner must indicate on or with the application his/her assent to the filing of the application.
APPLICATION - An application for the demolition of a building.
BUILDING - Any combination of materials having a roof, whether partial or full, and regardless of the presence or absence of walls or sides, and which is intended for shelter, housing, or enclosure of any person, process, equipment, animals, or goods, including a structure.
BUILDING INSPECTOR - The person occupying the office of Building Inspector or otherwise authorized to issue demolition permits.
COMMISSION – The Hamilton Historic District Commission, as defined by Chapter XXXI of the Town Bylaws, or its designee.
DEMOLITION - Any act of pulling down, destroying, removing, dismantling, or razing a building or commencing the work of total or substantial destruction with the intent of completing the same. The removal, whether in one project or more than one project over the course of a twenty-four (24) month period, of 50% or greater of a building involving the removal of historically significant character-defining exterior features as determined by the Commission shall constitute demolition. Normal repairs or maintenance in kind that is identical to the original structure does not constitute demolition.
DEMOLITION/ALTERATION PERMIT - The building permit issued by the Building Inspector as required by the State Building Code for demolition, substantial demolition, alteration, renovation or removal of a building, excluding a building permit issued solely for the demolition of the interior of a building.
HISTORIC DISTRICT - a defined district, such as the existing Hamilton Historic District, that has been established under the Historic Districts Act, General Laws, Chapter 40C.
PREFERABLY PRESERVED - Any significant building or structure that the Commission determines, following a public hearing, should be preserved or rehabilitated rather than demolished. A preferably preserved building or structure is subject to the 12-month demolition delay period of this bylaw.
SIGNIFICANT BUILDING – Any building or portion thereof within the Town constructed prior to 1940 and which has been determined by the Commission or its designee to be significant based on any of the following criteria:
- The building is listed on, or is within an area listed on, the National Register of Historic Places; or
- The building has been found, by the Massachusetts Historical Commission, to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places; or
- 77 -
- The building is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the Town, the Commonwealth or the nation; or
- The building is historically or architecturally important (in terms of period, style, method of building construction or association with a recognized architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of buildings.
If a building is of an unknown age, it shall be presumed to be constructed prior to 1940.
Procedure
No Demolition/Alteration Permit for a significant building shall be issued until the provisions of this bylaw have been satisfied.
An application for a Demolition/Alteration Permit for a building regulated by this bylaw is to be submitted to the Building Inspector, who shall within seven (7) calendar days of receipt transmit a copy thereof to the Commission. No Demolition/Alteration Permit shall be issued during this time.
An applicant who requires a Special Permit from the Planning Board or from the Board of Appeals in order to perform any activity subject to the requirements of this bylaw may, at the time of filing an application for said Special Permit, file with the Building Inspector a Notice of Intention to apply for a Demolition/Alteration Permit. Such Notice shall be filed in the same manner, and contain the same documentation, as an application for a Demolition/Alteration Permit for a building that was, in whole or part, built prior to 1940. The purpose of the Notice is to allow, if necessary, the applicable boards to hear and decide historic preservation and Special Permit matters contemporaneously. Once filed, such Notice shall be treated for the purpose of Historic Preservation review by the Commission and the special permit granting authority as an application filed pursuant to this section. In the event that the required Special Permit issues to the applicant, the Building Inspector may treat such Notice as an application for a Demolition/Alteration Permit.
An applicant may withdraw an application without prejudice at any time prior to a decision by the Commission.
The Building Inspector shall, within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of such application, forward a copy thereof to the Commission.
Within ten (10 business days of the receipt of the Application by the Commission, the Commission staff in consultation with the Chair of the Commission shall make an initial determination as to whether the building falls into one or more of the categories listed as (a) through (d) below, and shall notify in writing the Commission, the Building Commissioner, Town Clerk, Planning Director, the Applicant, and
- 78 -
the owner of record if different from the Applicant, of the initial determination. The categories are as follows:
a. The building is located in the Historic District;
b. The building is listed on or is within an area listed on the National or State Register of Historic places; is eligible for listing on either Register; or is a building for which a preliminary determination of eligibility has been made by the Massachusetts Historical Commission;
c. The building is associated with one or more significant historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economi, or social history of the Town, Commonwealth, or nation; or
d. The building is historically or architecturally significant in terms of its period, style, method of building construction, or its association with a significant architect or builder, either by itself or as part of a group of buildings.
If the building does not fall into any of these categories, the Chair and Commission Staff may determine that the building in question is not preferably preserved and not subject to the public hearing process. Within five (5) business days of the filing of the initial determination with the Town Clerk, any person aggrieved by the determination may file with Commission Staff and the Town Clerk an appeal of the Chair and Commission Staff’s determination and the application will require review by the full Commission. The Building Inspector may not issue the demolition permit until the expiration of the five (5) business day appeal period.
Within twenty one (21) calendar days of receipt of the application from the Building Inspector, the Commission shall hold a meeting to determine if a public hearing will be required to determine whether the significant building is preferably preserved. If it is determined that no public hearing is required, the Building Inspector is authorized to issue the demolition permit. If it is determined that a public hearing is required, the Commission will hold a public hearing as specified in this bylaw.
Within forty five (45) calendar days of the determination that a public hearing is required, the Commission shall hold a public hearing to determine if it is in the public interest for a significant building to be preserved or rehabilitated rather than demolished, and, based on such determination, whether the significant building is a preferably preserved building.
No less than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the hearing date, the Commission shall transmit written notice of the meeting time and place to the applicant, owner of record (if different from the applicant), the owners of all properties within 300 (three hundred) feet of the subject property, the Building Inspector, the Hamilton Historical Society, and any others the Commission deems necessary to notice. The Commission shall give notice of the public hearing by publishing once at least fourteen (14) calendar days before the hearing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the town of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. The applicant shall be responsible for the payment of the cost of publication.
- 79 -
In cases where it is known that additional approvals will be required for the proposed redevelopment of the premises, including zoning variances, special permits, and/or subdivision approvals, notice of the Commission’s public hearing shall be provided to the authority responsible for granting said approvals.
If, following the public hearing, the Commission determines that:
1. The building is historically or architecturally significant; and
2. The demolition of this historically or architecturally significant building would be detrimental to the historical or architectural resources of the Town,
the Commission shall declare the building a preferably preserved significant building.
If, following the public hearing, the Commission determines that the building proposed for demolition is not historically or architecturally significant, or that the proposed demolition of the building would not be detrimental to the purposes protected by this bylaw, the Commission shall notify the Building Inspector. The Building Inspector may then issue the Demolition/Alteration Permit.
The Commission shall file written notice of its decision with the Town Clerk within thirty (30) calendar days of its vote. A copy of the decision shall also be mailed to the applicant and provided to the Building Inspector.
Failure to open the hearing or file its decision with the Town Clerk within these prescribed time periods shall be deemed to constitute constructive approval by the Commission, and in such case, the Building Inspector shall, subject to the requirements of the State Building Code and any other applicable laws, by-laws, rules and regulations, issue the Demolition/Alteration Permit.
Upon a determination by the Commission that any building which is the subject of an application is a preferably preserved building, no permit for new construction or alterations of the premises shall be issued for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the receipt of the application of the Demolition/Alteration Permit to the Building Inspector unless otherwise agreed to by the Commission. The time period for delay shall be extended until the final resolution of any appeal of the Commission’s decision to delay filed by the applicant, if the appeal is not resolved by the end of the twelve month period.
If twelve (12) months (if no appeal by the applicant) or the extended time period as set forth in the preceding paragraph have passed since the Demolition/Alteration Permit application was submitted to the Building Inspector, a Demolition/Alteration Permit shall be promptly issued by the Building Inspector.
Notwithstanding the above, the Building Inspector may issue a Demolition/Alteration Permit for a preferably preserved building after receipt of written notice from the Commission that:
1. The building has been fully documented to the satisfaction of the Commission,
- 80 -
2. All salvageable and valuable artifacts and materials have been or will be removed and preserved to the satisfaction of the Commission, and
3. Any of the following applies:
a) The Commission is satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood that the applicant, owner, or some other reasonable person or group is willing to purchase, preserve, rehabilitate, restore, or relocate said building; or
b) The Commission is satisfied that for at least 12 (twelve) months, including periods of time prior to the date of submission of an application for demolition permit, the owner has made continuing, bona fide, and reasonable efforts to locate a purchaser to preserve, rehabilitate, restore, or relocate said building or structure, and that such efforts have been unsuccessful; or
c) The Commission is satisfied that the proposed demolition may be conducted in a manner that is not detrimental to the historical or architectural resources of the town.
The Building Inspector may issue a demolition permit or a building permit for a preferably preserved building within the 12 (twelve) months if the Commission notifies the Building Inspector in writing that the Commission finds that the intent and purpose of this bylaw is served even with the issuance of the demolition permit.
No permit for demolition of a building determined to be a preferably preserved building shall be granted until all plans for future use and development of the site have been filed with the Building Inspector and have been found to comply with all laws pertaining to the issuance of a building permit. All approvals necessary for the issuance of such building permit including without limitation any necessary zoning variances or special permits must be granted and all appeals from the granting of such approvals must be concluded prior to the issuance of a demolition permit under this bylaw.
A decision by the Commission expires two (2) years from the date of the decision. If demolition has not occurred prior to the expiration of the Commission’s decision, a new application for a demolition permit must be filed with the Building Inspector, and reviewed by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section, prior to any subsequent demolition.
Application Contents
An applicant proposing to demolish a building subject to this bylaw shall file with the Building Inspector an application containing the following information:
1. The address of the building to be demolished.
2. Map showing location of the building or portion thereof to be demolished, with reference to the lot lines and to neighboring buildings and structures.
- 81 -
3. Written description of the building or portion thereof to be demolished sufficient to identify the nature and extent of the proposed demolition.

Administration

In computing any period of time prescribed in this bylaw, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next business day.
The Commission is authorized to adopt a schedule of reasonable fees to cover the costs associated with the administration of this bylaw, including the retention of consultants deemed necessary to assist the Commission in its review of an application.
The Commission may delegate authority to make initial determinations of significance to one or more members of the Commission or to a municipal employee.
The Commission may proactively develop a list of significant buildings that will be subject to this by-law. Buildings proposed for the significant building list shall be added following a public hearing, with notice to the record owners of any building proposed to be included on the list.
Responsibilities of the Owner
The owner of a significant building for which a Demolition/Alteration Permit is being sought shall:
1. Provide such information as is reasonably requested by the Commission in connection with its consideration of whether the significant building is a preferably preserved building.
2. Allow exterior access to the property on which the significant building is located, as reasonably requested by the Commission; and
3. Secure the significant building.
- 82 -
An applicant who has applied for a Demolition/Alteration Permit for a preferably preserved building shall:
1. Participate in the investigation of preservation options for the preferably preserved building; and
2. Reasonably cooperate with the Commission and any interested parties seeking alternatives to the demolition of the preferably preserved building.
Once a significant building is determined to be a preferably preserved building, the owner shall be responsible for properly securing the building, if vacant, to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector.
Should the owner fail to secure the building, a subsequent destruction of the building at any time during the demolition delay period, which destruction could have been prevented by the required security measures, shall be considered a demolition in violation of this bylaw.
Emergency or Hardship Demolition
If after an inspection the Building Inspector finds that a building subject to this bylaw is found to pose an immediate threat to public health or safety due to its deteriorated condition and that there is no reasonable alternative to the immediate demolition of the building, then the Building Inspector may issue an emergency demolition permit to the owner.
The Building Inspector shall then prepare a report explaining the condition of the building and the basis for his decision, which shall be forwarded to the Commission, within five (5) calendar days.
If the owner of the building suffers from financial hardship such that sale of the building to a buyer who wishes to demolish the building is the only option to provide the owner with financial support to preserve or protect the owner’s health, safety or well-being, the Chair and the Commission staff may file with the Town Clerk and the Building Inspector a determination of financial hardship. Within five (5) business days of the filing of the determination of financial hardship with the Town Clerk, any person aggrieved by the determination may file with Commission Staff and the Town Clerk an appeal of the Chair and Commission Staff’s determination and the application will require review by the full Commission. The Building Inspector may not issue the demolition permit until the expiration of the five (5) business day appeal period. In reviewing a request for a determination of financial hardship, the Chair and Commission staff may consider the sale price, the identity of the buyer, and the buyer’s relationship with the owner, if any, to ensure that the purchase is not an effort to evade the provisions of this bylaw.
Nothing in this bylaw is intended to conflict with or abridge any obligations or rights conferred by G.L. c. 143, §§ 6-10 regarding removal or demolition of dangerous or abandoned structures. In the event of a conflict, the applicable provisions of Chapter 143 shall control.
Nothing in this bylaw shall be deemed to conflict with or abridge the authority of the Board of Health pursuant to G.L. c. 111, § 127B or the Board of Selectmen pursuant to G.L. c. 139, §§ 1 – 3A. The
- 83 -
Board of Health or the Board of Selectmen is encouraged to consult with the Commission prior to taking action against a building constructed prior to 1940.
Nothing in this by-law shall be deemed to conflict with the provisions of the Historic Districts Act, Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 40C, with respect to requirements of notice, hearing and issuance by the Commission of a Certificate of Appropriateness, a Certificate of Non-Applicability or a Certificate of Hardship prior to demolition of any building in the historic district.
Enforcement and Remedies
Permits and determinations under this bylaw shall run with the land.
The Commission and Building Inspector are each specifically authorized to institute any and all actions and proceedings as either of them may deem necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance with the requirements of this bylaw or to prevent a threatened violation thereof.
Any owner of a significant building that is demolished without first obtaining a Demolition/Alteration Permit in accordance with the provisions of this bylaw shall be subject to a penalty of $100 (one hundred dollars). Each day the violation exists until a faithful restoration of the demolished building or other remediation plan has been approved by the Commission shall constitute a separate offense. The Building Inspector may enforce this section by noncriminal disposition as provided by MGL c. 40, § 21D.
If a significant building is voluntarily demolished without first obtaining a Demolition/Alteration Permit, no building permit authorizing construction on the lot on which the building was located or on any adjoining lot under common ownership therewith shall be issued for a period of two (2) years from the date of the demolition on the subject parcel of land or any adjoining parcels of land under common ownership or control, unless the building permit is for the faithful restoration of the significant building or unless otherwise agreed to by the Commission.

BYLAW FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF UNSAFE STRUCTURES OR PROPERTY AND THE MAINTENANCE OF VACANT BUILDINGS
1. AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
Pursuant to the general powers granted to towns by Article 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and the specific powers granted by Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 139, Sections 1-3A, this Bylaw is adopted for the prevention of any unreasonable interference with the common interest of the general public in maintaining decent, safe, and sanitary structures. The provisions of this Bylaw shall be applicable to any building, structure, or property that meets any one of the two sets of conditions set forth herein under the definitions of “Unsafe Structure or Property,” or “Vacant Buildings”.
- 96 -
2. DEFINITIONS
A. Building - A structure, whether portable or fixed, with exterior walls or firewalls and a roof, built, erected or framed, of a combination of any materials, to form shelter for persons, animals, or property.
B. Structure - A combination of materials, whether wholly or partially level with, above or below the surface of the ground, whether permanent or temporary, assembled at a fixed location to give support, shelter, or enclosure such as a building (see above), framework, retaining wall, platform, bin, fence, parking area, sign, flagpole, or mast for antenna or the like.
C. Enforcement Authority – This Bylaw shall be enforced by the Building Commissioner or his qualified designee.
D. Interested Parties - In connection with the enforcement and notification requirements of this Bylaw, Interested Parties are: the Enforcement Authority; any Responsible Party; owners and occupants of property abutting the subject property; owners and occupants of property directly opposite the subject property on any public or private street or way; and a person filing a complaint under this Bylaw.
E. Occupant - A person who occupies real property with the consent of the owner as a lessee, tenant at will, licensee, or otherwise. The singular use of the term includes the plural when the context so indicates.
F. Owner - Every person who alone or jointly or severally with others (a) has legal title to any building, structure or property; or (b) has care, charge, or control of any such building structure or property in any capacity including but not limited to agent, executor, executrix, administrator, administratrix, trustee or guardian of the estate of the holder of legal title; or (c) is a mortgagee in possession; or (d) is an agent, trustee or other person appointed by the courts.
G. Responsible Party - The owner or occupant (in the case of real property) of property that is the subject of proceedings under this Bylaw. The singular use of the term includes the plural when the context so indicates.
3. UNSAFE STRUCTURE OR PROPERTY
Unsafe is a condition of a structure or structures or personal property that exposes persons to unreasonable risk of injury or harm, or exposes property to unreasonable risk of damage, loss or destruction.
4. VACANT BUILDINGS
Vacant buildings or structures are ones which (a) are or will be unoccupied, i.e., not inhabited or lived in, by a Responsible Party for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or more and (b) for which the Responsible Party has failed to do any of the following: (a) comply with all applicable sanitary, building, and fire codes and orders issued pursuant thereto;
- 97 -
(b) secure the premises to prevent unauthorized entry and exposure to the elements; (c) maintain the premises in a manner that ensures their external/visible maintenance, including but not limited to the maintenance of major systems, the removal of trash and debris, and the upkeep of lawns, shrubbery, and other landscape features; (d) repair or replace broken windows or doors within thirty (30) days. Boarding up any doors or windows is prohibited except as a temporary measure for no longer than thirty (30) days, and; (e) for properties vacant for six months or more at which the utilities have been shut off, remove or cut and cap such utilities to prevent accidents.
5. VIOLATIONS
If the Enforcement Authority is informed of or has reason to believe that unsafe conditions, as defined in Section 3, or that vacant buildings, as defined in Section 4, exist on any real property in the Town, he may make or cause to be made an investigation of the facts, including an inspection of the property where the condition may exist. In making such inspection, the Enforcement Authority shall have such right of access to premises that may be lawfully exercised by him under the laws and constitution of the Commonwealth and/or of the United States.
6. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT A. Procedures – During his investigation of the matter, the Enforcement Authority shall make reasonable efforts to consult with the Responsible Party for the purpose of obtaining voluntary compliance with this Bylaw before initiating any enforcement action.
If, after inspection, the Enforcement Authority confirms the existence of unsafe conditions or vacant buildings in violation of this Bylaw and the Responsible Party fails to voluntarily comply, he shall issue a Notice of Violation and may make and issue such Orders as he deems necessary to correct or eliminate the unsafe conditions or obtain compliance with the requirements for vacant buildings. Said Notice and Orders shall be in writing and shall be served upon all Responsible Parties as can be determined after reasonable inquiry.
Any Interested Party who has filed a written complaint of unsafe conditions or vacant buildings to the Enforcement Authority upon which complaint the Enforcement Authority has determined that the conditions do not exist, or the Enforcement Authority has taken action that the Interested Party claims is inadequate, shall have a right to a review of the matter by the Town Manager. At the request of such an Interested Party, the Town Manager shall confer with the Enforcement Authority and may confer with other appropriate agencies of Town government such as the Council on Aging, Assessors Department, and Building Department. The Town Manager shall make a decision and recommend appropriate action in writing to the Interested Parties, the Responsible Parties, the Enforcement Authority, and the Board of Selectmen. Any person aggrieved by the decision and recommendation of the Town Manager may request a hearing before the Board of Selectmen. Said request shall be in writing and received by the Board of Selectmen within ten (10) business days of issuance of the Town Manager’s decision. A copy of the hearing request shall also be delivered to the complainant, if any, and to all Interested Parties. It shall be the
- 98 -
responsibility of the person requesting the hearing to show that all Interested Parties have been notified of the request. If no such request is received within the time specified herein, the order of the Enforcement Authority shall be final. A request for hearing shall not constitute a stay of the Enforcement Authority’s Order unless the Enforcement Authority so orders. Upon receipt of a timely request, the Board of Selectmen shall convene a public hearing, which may include an examination of any complainant or Responsible Party, under oath, to determine whether conditions under this Bylaw exist. Based on the evidence and testimony presented at said public hearing, the Board of Selectmen may affirm the Enforcement Authority’s Order, reverse and nullify the Order, or issue any such Order as it deems necessary to ensure the protection of public safety and/or eliminate unsafe conditions. The determination of the Board of Selectmen after a hearing shall be final.
Fines for non-compliance with the Enforcement Authority’s or Board of Selectmen’s Order may be assessed as a non-criminal disposition pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 40, Section 21D and Article XIII of the Town’s Bylaws in the following amounts:
i. First offense, $100.00
ii. Second offense, $200.00
iii. Third and successive offenses, $300.00 each
Each violation of this Bylaw shall constitute a separate offense. Each day that any such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.
The Enforcement Authority may require that a complaint be made in writing subject to the penalties of perjury. If the Enforcement Authority determines that a reported condition may warrant immediate action, or constitutes a substantial violation of this Bylaw, the Enforcement Authority may seek authority to file for injunctive relief in court without first holding a hearing or providing prior notice to the Responsible Party and without requiring the disclosure of the identity of the complainant.
If the Enforcement Authority determines that the condition is subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Health or is a violation of the State Sanitary Code or any health regulation, in addition to enforcing this Bylaw, he shall refer the matter to the Board of Health for action.
B. Notice to Complainant - In any matter in which a complaint has been made by a person other than the Enforcement Authority, the Enforcement Authority shall notify the complainant in advance of all conferences or proceedings concerning resolution of the complaint or of any enforcement action and the complainant shall be allowed to be present.
C. Removal of Unsafe Conditions or Vacant Buildings by Selectmen - If the Responsible Party fails to remedy the conditions upon notice and order from the Enforcement Authority to do so, the Board of Selectmen may cause corrective action for the conditions as provided in General Laws c. 139.
E. Reports by Enforcement Authority - The Enforcement Authority shall file with the Town Manager each month a report that shall include all complaints under this Bylaw made to him during the
- 99 -
prior month; all proceedings begun by him under this Bylaw; all pending complaints and all investigations and enforcement actions taken by him or referred to the Board of Health. The report shall state the location of the premises, a summary of the nature of the complaint, the name of the Responsible Party(ies), and the disposition or the status of the matter.
7. OTHER LAWS
Compliance with this Bylaw shall not relieve the Responsible Party of any applicable obligations set forth in any other codes, regulations, covenant conditions or restrictions, and/or homeowner or condominium association rules and regulations.

4. To conserve natural conditions, to promote the educational, cultural and economic
welfare of the public through the preservation and protection of Buildings, sites, and
districts of historic interest; and
5. To improve and beautify the Town by encouraging the most appropriate uses of land
within the Town in accordance with the General or Master Plan, and under the provisions
of Chapter 40A of the Massachusetts General Laws, as amended, and Section 2A of 1975
Mass. Acts 808.
1.2 AUTHORITY. This By-law is enacted in accordance with the provisions of the General
Laws, Chapter 40A, and any and all amendments thereto, and by Article 89 of the Amendments

location and use of Buildings, Structures, and land in the Town are regulated as hereinafter
provided.
1.4 APPLICABILITY. All Buildings or Structures hereinafter erected, reconstructed,
altered, enlarged, or moved, and the use of all premises in the Town, shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the By-law. No Building, Structure or land shall be used for any purpose or in
any manner other than is expressly permitted within the district in which such Building,
Structure or land is located. Where the application of this By-law imposes greater restrictions
than those imposed by any other regulations, permits, restrictions, easements, covenants, or
agreements, the provisions of this By-law shall control.
1.4.1 Applicability/Nonconformities. Except as herein after provided, this By-law shall not
apply to Buildings, Structures or uses lawfully in existence or lawfully begun, or to a building
permit or special permit issued before the first publication of notice of the public hearing on this
By-law or any amendments thereto, but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of
2
such use, to a building permit or special permit issued after the first notice or said public hearing,
to any reconstruction, extension or structural change of such Building or Structure and to any
alteration of a Building or Structure begun after the first notice of said public hearing to provide
for its use in a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different
manner or to a substantially greater extent except where alteration, reconstruction, extension or a
structural change to a Single Family Dwelling or Two Family Dwelling does not increase the
nonconforming nature of said Structure.

building permit or special permit shall conform to any subsequent amendments to this By-law,
unless the use or construction is commenced within a period of not more than six months after

SECTION 5.0 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
5.1 APPLICABILITY. This By-law shall not apply to Structures or uses lawfully in
existence or lawfully begun, or to a Building or special permit issued before the first publication
of notice of the public hearing required by G.L. c. 40A, s. 5 at which this By-law, or any relevant
part thereof, was adopted. Such prior, lawfully existing nonconforming uses and Structures may
continue, provided that no modification of the use or Structure is accomplished, unless
authorized hereunder.
5.2 NONCONFORMING USES. The Zoning Board of Appeals may by Finding allow a
change to a nonconforming use in accordance with this Section only if it determines that such
change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming use to the
neighborhood.
5.2.1 Eligible Changes. The following types of changes to nonconforming uses may be
considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals:
1. Change or substantial extension of the use.
5.3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES. The Zoning Board of Appeals may by Finding
allow a change to a nonconforming Structure in accordance with this Section only if it
determines that such change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing
nonconforming Structure to the neighborhood.
5.3.1 Eligible Changes. The following types of changes to nonconforming Structures may be
considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals:
1. Reconstruction, extension or structural change; and
2. Alteration to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a
substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent.
5.3.2 Variance Required. Except as provided in Section 5.3.3 and 5.3.4, below, a variance
from the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be required for:
1.The change of a nonconforming Structure in such a manner as to increase an existing
nonconformity or create a new nonconformity; and
2. The extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within
a required Yard.
5.3.3 Nonconforming Single and Two Family Residential Structures. Nonconforming
Single and Two Family Dwelling Structures may be changed only upon a determination by the
Building Commissioner that such proposed change does not increase the nonconforming nature
of said Structure by more than one hundred (100) percent of the Residential Gross Floor Area.
20
5.3.4. Eligible Changes. The following circumstances shall not be deemed to increase the
nonconforming nature of Nonconforming Single and Two Family Dwelling Structures and the
Building Commissioner may issue a building permit:
1. The existing Structure is on a conforming Lot but is nonconforming because it
encroaches on a setback and the proposed alteration or extension will not change the
setback which fails to conform, and the entire structure meets all other requirements of
this By-law including but not limited to height and Lot coverage.
2. The existing Structure is nonconforming solely because it is located on a Lot which is
nonconforming as to size and/or Lot Frontage as the result of a zoning change, and the
existing Structure and proposed alteration or extension meets all other current
requirements of the By-law including but not limited to setbacks, height and Lot
coverage.
3. The existing Structure is a residence in a district where residences are permitted,
the Structure is situated on a nonconforming Lot or has nonconforming Yards, and the
proposed alteration or extension is a reconstruction or repair which does not change the
Lot size or Yards which fail to conform. For the purposes of this subsection only, the
term “reconstruction” shall not include the voluntary demolition of such Structure and its
rebuilding. See Section 5.5.
If the Building Commissioner determines that proposed change exceeds one (1) or more of the
criteria set forth above, the Zoning Board of Appeals may, by Finding, allow such change where
it determines that the proposed modification will not be substantially more detrimental than the
existing nonconforming structure to the neighborhood.
5.4 ABANDONMENT OR NON-USE. A nonconforming use or Structure which has been
abandoned or not used for a period of two (2) years shall lose its protected status and be subject
to all of the provisions of this By-law.

nonconforming Structure may be reconstructed after a catastrophe or after voluntary demolition
in accordance with the following provisions:
5.5.1 Procedures.
1. Reconstruction of said premises shall commence within two (2) years after such
catastrophe or demolition, with the reconstruction completed and the Structure occupied
within a reasonable time thereafter.
2. Building(s) reconstructed as of right shall be located on the same footprint as the
original nonconforming Structure and shall be only as great in volume or area as the
original nonconforming Structure.
21
3. In the event that the proposed reconstruction would (a) cause the Structure to exceed
the volume or area of the original nonconforming Structure, or (b) cause the Structure to
be located other than on the original footprint, a special permit shall be required from the
Zoning Board of Appeals. In the case of voluntary demolition, the special permit shall be
obtained prior to such demolition.
5.6 REVERSION TO CONFORMITY OR MORE RESTRICTIVE USE. No
nonconforming use shall, if changed to a conforming use or to a more restrictive use, revert to a
nonconforming or less restrictive use.
5.7 SUBSTANDARD LOTS. When a prior lawful nonconforming Structure is located on a
Lot which does not meet current dimensional requirements, such Lot shall not be changed, unless
the change does not result in exacerbation of an existing nonconformity or a new nonconformity.

SECTION 7.0 SPECIAL REGULATIONS
7.1 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USES.
7.1.1 Purpose. It has been documented in numerous towns and cities throughout the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and elsewhere in the United States that Adult Entertainment
Uses are distinguishable from other business uses and that Adult Entertainment Uses degrade the
quality of life in the areas of a community where they are located. Studies have shown
secondary impacts such as increased levels of crime and blight resulting from the clustering and
concentration of Adult Entertainment Uses. Late night noise and traffic also increase due to the
late hours of operation of many of these establishments. This Section is adopted pursuant to
G.L. c. 40A, s. 9A with the purpose and intent of regulating and limiting the location of Adult
Entertainment Uses (as defined herein) so as to prevent the secondary effects associated with
these establishments and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the present and
future inhabitants of the Town of Hamilton.
1. The provisions of this Section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative matter or materials,
including sexually oriented matter or materials.
2. Similarly, it is not the intent or effect of this Section to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented matter or materials protected by the Constitution of the United
26
States or of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nor restrict nor deny rights that
distributors or exhibitors of such matter or materials may have to sell, distribute, or
exhibit such matter or materials. Neither is it the intent or effect of this subsection to
legalize the distribution of obscene matter or materials.

terrain, does not appear as a scar on the landscape, and is approved by the Planning Board
and the Fire Chief to assure emergency access at all times.
8. Design. Consideration shall be given to design that minimizes erosion, construction
on unstable soils, and steep slopes.
9. Height. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that
the location of the CT and/or TAF is necessary and that the size and height are the
minimum necessary for the purpose. The Planning Board shall give consideration to the
possible need for additional height to accommodate future co-locators. It may require
that a structure be built to, or be designed to be extended to, a future height limit.
10. Signs. There shall be no signs, except for announcement signs, applicable warning
signs, no trespassing signs and a required sign giving a phone number where the owner
can be reached on a twenty-four (24) hour basis. All signs shall conform to the sign
requirements of Section 6.3, and shall be subject to conditions of the Site Plan Review
and any special permit.

utilities from and to the communications site shall be installed underground.
12. Visual Impact. The CT and/or TAF shall minimize adverse visual effect on the
environment and the residents of Hamilton. The Planning Board may impose reasonable
conditions to ensure this result, including, but not limited to: painting, lighting standards,
screening, and camouflage.
7.2.7 Clearing. Clearing shall be performed in a manner that will maximize preservation of
natural beauty and conservation of natural resources, which will minimize marring, and scarring
of the landscape or silting of streams.
1. The time and method of clearing rights-of-way should take into account soil stability,
the protection of natural vegetation, the protection of adjacent resources, such as the
protection of natural habitat for wildlife, and appropriate measures for the prevention of
silt deposition in water courses.
2. Clearing of natural vegetation should be limited to that material which poses a hazard
to the CT or TAF.
3. The use of “brush blades” instead of dirt blades on bulldozers is recommended in
clearing operations where such use will preserve the cover crop of grass, low growing
brush, or other vegetation.

reduced tower density in community, etc.).
5. All CTs greater than one hundred ten (110) feet in height shall be monopole in type.
33
6. Night lighting of towers shall be prohibited unless required by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA). Lighting shall be limited to that needed for emergencies and/or as
required by the FAA. To the fullest extent practicable, facilities and towers shall be
designed to avoid FAA required marking and/or lighting requirements.
7. Siting shall be such that the view of the tower from other areas of Town shall be as
minimal as possible. The Planning Board will pay particular attention to the visibility of
the proposed structure from public ways, from historic districts, from popular scenic
areas, and from natural views from residential neighborhoods.
8. Access roads shall be designed to visually conceal all CTs.
9. Shared use of towers and facilities is to be encouraged. When sharing a tower is
technically not practical, replacement of the tower or the addition of a new tower may be
considered. Towers shall be separated on a site so that each tower will not significantly
impact the other.
10. The tower and/or facility shall be designed to accommodate the maximum number of
users technologically practical.
7.2.9 Approval. A special permit shall be granted by the Planning Board in accordance with the
provisions of this Section and Section 10.5.2. Any extension of the tower or antenna support
structure, addition of antennas not previously permitted, replacement of antennas with

SECTION 8.0 SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL REGULATIONS
8.1 OPEN SPACE AND FARMLAND PRESERVATION DEVELOPMENT.
8.1.1 Purpose. The purpose of Open Space and Farmland Preservation Development (OSFPD)
is to:
45
1. Protect permanently open space, agricultural and forestry land, historical and
archeological resources, existing and proposed trails, wildlife habitat and corridors, and
other natural resources including wetlands and water bodies, in a manner consistent with
the goals of the Hamilton Master Plan;
2. Encourage creative, environmentally sensitive design as the preferred form of
residential development;
3. Encourage a more efficient form of development that consumes less open land and
respects existing topography and natural features better than a conventional or grid
subdivision;
4. Provide a variety of housing choices, particularly for older persons;
5. Reduce the anticipated negative fiscal impact on the Town associated with
conventional residential development; and
6. Provide a development option to large-parcel landowners who wish to see a
continuation of their stewardship of the land.
8.1.2 Applicability. In the R-la, R-lb, or R-A Districts, an applicant may obtain a special permit
from the Planning Board for an OSFPD. An OSFPD is encouraged for developments which
involve ten (10) or more acres or five (5) or more Dwelling Units but also is available for smaller
developments. An OSFPD special permit allows the applicant a greater number of Lots or
Dwelling Units on the site than allowed under a conventional subdivision in return for the
applicant providing at least 50% of the total land area as permanently protected common open
space as well as other benefits, all on terms and conditions further described in this Section 8.
8.1.3 Significance of Grant of Special Permit. Approval of an OSFPD special permit is a
preliminary approval only. An applicant wishing to proceed with an OSFPD must then proceed
with a definitive subdivision plan and/or a Cluster Design Plan, as described below. Approval of
an OSFPD special permit does not indicate approval of the Board of Health, Conservation
Commission, or any other entity from which the development requires separate permits or
approvals. At any time during the OSFPD approval process the applicant maintains the option of
withdrawing from the OSFPD process and proceeding with a conventional subdivision plan.
8.1.4 Future Subdivision. The common open space and all Lots in an OSFPD may not be
further subdivided, and a notation to this effect shall be placed on the plan of record, which shall
be recorded at the Registry of Deeds.
8.1.5 Planning Board Regulations. The Planning Board shall adopt and from time to time may
amend OSFPD Rules and Regulations to implement this Section. Such regulations shall include
but will not be limited to submission requirements; plan requirements, such as size, form,
number and contents; development standards; site standards; and standards for Building
46
placement and design. Such rules and regulations are authorized under G.L. c. 40A, s. 9, and
shall be adopted after vote by the Planning Board.
8.1.6 Permitted Uses. An OSFPD may include the following uses:
1. Single Family Dwellings.
2. Townhouse Dwellings, not to exceed four Dwelling Units per Building.
3. Multi-family Dwellings, not to exceed six Dwelling Units per Building.
4. Open space and conservation areas.
5. Passive recreation, including trails for walking, hiking, cross country skiing, and
horseback riding, and areas for other low-impact activities such as picnicking and
wildlife observation.
6. Agricultural, equestrian, and horticultural uses.
7. Accessory recreational uses, such as a tennis court or playground in the developed
area.
8.1.7 Pre-Application Conference. The applicant shall request and attend a pre-application
review at a regular business meeting of the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall invite the
Board of Health, Building Commissioner, Conservation Commission and Open Space
Committee, Department of Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Historic District
Commission, Office on Disability, and Zoning Board of Appeals to attend. The primary purpose
of the pre-application conference is to identify the site’s natural or historically important
features, riding or walking trails on the site and abutting parcels, public safety, traffic or
infrastructure issues, and areas the Town prefers to see preserved as open space or for
agricultural or equestrian uses. The secondary purpose of a pre-application review is to
minimize the applicant’s cost of engineering and other technical experts, and to commence
discussions with the Planning Board at the earliest possible stage of development. Meetings may
be held by mutual agreement of the Planning Board and the applicant. At the pre-application
review, the applicant may outline the proposed OSFPD, seek preliminary feedback from the
Planning Board, and set a timetable for submittal of a formal application. At the expense of the
applicant, the Planning Board may engage technical experts to review the informal plans of the
applicant and to facilitate submittal of a formal application for an OSFPD special permit.
8.1.8 OSFPD Special Permit Application Procedures. An application for a special
permit for an OSFPD shall include a Yield Analysis and an OSFPD Concept Plan. The Planning
Board may engage technical experts, at the applicants’ expense, as reasonably necessary in
connection with its review of the applicant’s proposed analysis or plan(s).
8.1.9 Sources of Data. Both the Yield Analysis and the OSFPD Concept Plan may be prepared
from existing data, such as deed information, USGS topographical maps, FEMA floodplain
47
maps, assessor’s maps, photographs, soil maps, or Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) Wetlands Conservancy Program maps. The locations of wetlands, streams and forest
limits or locations will not be verified during the Concept Plan special permit process until the
applicant has delineated the same in the field and has obtained from the Hamilton Conservation
Commission a positive determination verifying delineation, or the applicant has been issued an
Order of Resource Area Delineation under the procedures outlined in G.L. c. 131 s. 40 and
Chapter 17 of the Town of Hamilton By-laws. It is not necessary to verify these constraints for
Concept Plan submittals, but the applicant must be aware that these locations should be as
accurate as possible in order to avoid significant changes to the Concept Plan in subsequent
applications for approval of an OSFPD definitive subdivision plan or Cluster Design Plan.
8.1.10 Allowed OSFPD Density. The Allowed OSFPD Density is the maximum number of
Lots (or Dwelling Units) in an OSFPD which shall be one and one fifth (1.2) times the Base
Maximum Density, as may be further increased by the Planning Board pursuant to Section 8.1.21
based on additional public benefits being provided by the OSFPD. Computations shall be
rounded to the nearest whole number.
8.1.11 OSFPD Concept Plan. The OSFPD Concept Plan shall be prepared by a Registered
Professional Landscape Architect, Civil Engineer, or Architect, or by a multi-disciplinary team
of which one (1) member must be a Registered Professional Landscape Architect, and shall
include the information listed below. The OSFPD Concept Plan shall be produced through the
five-step OSFPD special permit design process and shall incorporate the common open space
requirement, dimensional standards, and OSFPD special permit design standards all as set forth
in this Section.
1. Title Block including the name of the Owner of record, name of applicant, address of
the property, and the Assessors’ Map and Lot Number; name of the company preparing
the plan, address and phone number, signature and stamp of professional(s) preparing the
plan, date of plan, scale;
2. The location of the proposed development;
3. The size of the site in acres;
4. An existing conditions inventory and description of conservation areas identified
during the OSFPD special permit design process pursuant to this Section;
5. The total number and approximate locations of the proposed Buildings, Dwelling
Units and/or Lots, and the approximate size of each in square feet;
6. The acreage and proposed use(s) of permanently protected common open space;
7. A statement on the disposition or manner of ownership of the proposed open space;
48
8. The areas or approximate delineation of Lots that will be used as building areas, and
the areas or approximate delineation of Lots that are to remain as permanently protected
common open space;
9. A general description of how drainage will be handled, including a soils statement
(soil conservation survey is acceptable) and the general area of the site to be used for
stormwater management facilities; and
10. Sufficient detail of proposed built and natural features as described in this Section to
enable the Planning Board to make the required determinations.
8.1.12 OSFRD Special Permit Design Process.
1. Identification of Conservation Areas. The first step in the design process requires
identification of conservation areas on the site, including wetlands, areas located in the
Conservancy District, riverfront areas, and floodplains regulated by state, federal, or local
law; unprotected natural landscape features such as steep slopes, mature woodlands,
prime farmland, meadows, wildlife habitats and wildlife corridors or connections
thereto; cultural features such as historic and archeological sites and scenic views; and
recreational features such as established trails used for horseback riding, walking and
cross-country skiing. To the maximum extent feasible, conservation areas shall include
areas identified by the Planning Board during the pre-application conference.
2. Identification and Delineation of the Proposed Development Area. The second step in
the design process is to define and delineate the area that will contain buildings,
roadways, other site improvements and amenities for residents of the development. To
the maximum extent feasible, the proposed development area shall consist of land outside
the identified conservation areas.
3. Location of Dwelling Units. The third step in the design process is to identify and
delineate the approximate location of Dwelling Units in the proposed development area.
The number of Dwelling Units should conform to the Allowed OSFPD Density
calculated pursuant to Sections 8.1.10 and 8.1.21. The location of Dwelling Units should
account for proximity to common open space and other amenities, including community
buildings for use by residents of the development. Toward this end, the number of
Dwelling Units with direct access to the amenities of the development should be
maximized.
4. Roads and Trails. The fourth step in the design process is to identify and delineate the
approximate location of roads and trails. Roads shall be aligned to access the Dwelling
Units. The layout of new trails should anticipate internal and external connections to
existing and/or potential future roads, trails and sidewalks.
5. Lotting. If applicable, the final step in the design process is to identify the
approximate location of Lot lines.
49
8.1.13 Common Open Space Requirement. To qualify for an OSFPD special permit, a
development must provide at least fifty (50) percent of the total land area as permanently
protected, usable, common open space that is functional for purposes intended by this Section.
The common open space shall have no Structures, parking, private Yards, patios, or gardens that
are restricted for the exclusive or principal use by residents of individual Dwelling Units. The
following standards apply to the common open space in an OSFPD:
1. Use, Shape, Location of Common Open Space. To the maximum extent feasible, the
common open space shall be undisturbed, unaltered and left in its natural condition or
existing condition. It shall be appropriate in size, shape, dimension, location, and
character to assure its use as a conservation area, or where appropriate, a recreational
area, and serve as a visual and natural amenity for the development and the Town;
2. Contiguous. The common open space shall be Contiguous Open Space and linked as
a unit, with links at least seventy-five (75) feet wide, unless waived by the Planning
Board;
3. Common open space shall be functional for wildlife habitat, passive recreation,
resource preservation, agriculture, or equestrian uses;
4. The location(s) and configuration of the common open space shall be subject to
approval by the Planning Board;
5. Each parcel of common open space shall offer adequate access to residents of the
OSFPD;
6. Land used for common or shared septic systems may not be counted toward the
minimum common open space requirement unless authorized by the Planning Board;
7. Not more than fifty (50) percent of the common open space in an OSFPD shall
consist of areas subject to the Wetlands Protection Act, G.L. c. 131, s. 40, for reasons
other than being subject to flooding, or land in the Conservancy District.
8. Existing utility easements may not be counted as common open space; and
9. Up to five (5) percent of the minimum required open space may be used for gravel
roadways, pavement or structures accessory to the dedicated use or uses of the common
open space. Principal or accessory structures and access roads essential to an agricultural
use are exempt from this requirement, except for indoor/covered riding rings.
8.1.14 Ownership of the Common Open Space. Any common open space within an OSFPD
shall be conveyed to the Town and accepted for park or open space use, and/or shall be conveyed
to a nonprofit organization the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space,
and/or shall be conveyed to a corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of Lots or
residential units within the plan, as provided by G.L. c. 40A, s. 9. In any case where the
common open space is not conveyed to the Town, a restriction enforceable by the Town or the
50
Conservation Commission shall be recorded providing that such land shall be kept in an open or
natural state and not be built for residential use or developed for accessory uses such as parking
or roadway.
8.1.15 Dimensional Standards. To maintain harmony with surrounding areas, existing
dimensional requirements of this By-law shall apply to any lot located along the perimeter of an
OSFPD or abutting any existing residential development. In addition, any OSFPD lot that relies
on an existing public way for frontage shall conform to the applicable Lot Frontage and Front
Yard setback requirements. For interior lots in an OSFPD, the Planning Board may waive the
requirements for minimum lot area, setbacks, building coverage, frontage, number of Dwelling
Units per Lot, shared driveways or irregular Lot shape that would normally apply in the zoning
district in order to maximize the amount of open space, reduce site disturbance and protect
significant farmland or scenic landscapes. The following additional requirements apply within
the OSFPD:
1. The minimum distance between clusters of any Townhouse Dwellings shall be fifty
(50) feet unless waived by the Planning Board to further the purposes of this Section.
2. At least fifty (50) percent of the required Yard setbacks shall be maintained on interior
lots in the OSFPD unless a reduction is authorized by the Planning Board to
accommodate “zero lot line” design.
8.1.16 OSFPD Special Permit General Design Standards. The following general design
standards shall apply to all OSFPDs and shall govern the development and design process:
1. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state, insofar as practicable, by
minimizing tree and soil removal. The grade changes shall be in keeping with the general
appearance of the neighboring developed areas. The orientation of individual building
sites shall be such as to maintain maximum natural topography and cover. Topography,
tree cover, and natural drainage ways shall be treated as fixed determinants of road and
lot configuration rather than as malleable elements that can be changed to follow a
preferred development scheme;
2. Streets shall be designed and located in such a manner as to maintain and preserve
natural topography, significant landmarks and trees, to minimize cut and fill, and to
preserve and enhance views and vistas on or off the subject property;
3. Building designs shall relate harmoniously to the terrain and the use, scale, and
architecture of existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationship
to the proposed buildings;
4. All open space shall be designed to add to the visual amenities of the area by
maximizing its visibility for persons passing the site or overlooking it from nearby
properties; and
51
5. The removal or disruption of historic, traditional or significant uses, structures, or
architectural elements shall be minimized insofar as practicable, whether these exist on
the site or any adjacent properties.
8.1.17 OSFPD Special Permit Site Specific Design Standards. The following site specific
design standards shall apply to all OSFPDs and shall govern the development and design
process:
1. Mix of Housing Types. The OSFPD may consist of a combination of Single Family
Dwelling, Two Family Dwelling, and other Multifamily Dwelling. Two-bedroom
Dwelling Units are encouraged to be designated as restricted to Elderly Persons;
2. Parking. Each Dwelling Unit shall be served by two (2) off-street parking spaces.
Parking spaces in front of garages may count in the computation. All parking areas with
greater than four spaces shall be screened from view from the road. Residential
structures should be oriented toward the street serving the premises and not the required
parking area;
3. Buffer Areas. A vegetated buffer area of twenty-five (25) feet minimum shall be
provided at the following locations:
a. Perimeter of the property where it abuts residentially zoned and occupied
properties;
b. Certain resource areas on or adjacent to the tract such as rock outcrops, ledge,
agricultural or recreational fields, and land held for conservation purposes;
c. A landscape plan will be required for buffers to ensure screening from abutting
properties. Additions to existing plantings may be required by the Planning
Board. The Planning Board may waive the buffer requirement when it determines
that a small buffer (or no buffer) will suffice to accomplish the objective set forth
herein; and
d. Driveways necessary for access and egress to and from the tract may cross
such buffer areas.
4. Stormwater Runoff and Drainage. The peak rate of stormwater runoff and drainage
design shall comply with the DEP Stormwater Management Policy. All structural
surface stormwater management facilities shall be accompanied by a conceptual
screening and landscape plan. The Planning Board shall encourage low impact
development practices such as the use of “soft” (non-structural) natural stormwater
management techniques (such as open swales) and other drainage techniques that do not
create impervious surfaces and that enable infiltration where appropriate. Water
conservation measures, including but not limited to the use of rainwater retention
systems, such as rain barrels and cisterns for water irrigation purposes, are also strongly
encouraged;
52
5. Common/Shared Driveway. A common or shared Driveway may serve a maximum of
three Dwelling Units unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board, with input from
public safety officials; and
6. On-site Pedestrian and Bicycle Circulation. Walkways and bicycle paths shall be
provided to link residences with parking areas, recreation facilities (including parkland
and open space) and adjacent land uses where appropriate.
8.1.18 Review Procedures for OSFPD Special Permit.
1. The applicant shall furnish a copy of the application to the Town Clerk. The applicant
shall furnish sufficient copies of the special permit application to the Planning Board to
distribute for review to the Board of Health, Board of Selectmen, Building
Commissioner, Conservation Commission and Open Space Committee, Department of
Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Historic District Commission, Office on
Disability, and Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. Reports from the above-named boards and officials shall be submitted to the Planning
Board within thirty-five (35) days of receipt by the reviewing party. In the event that the
public hearing by the Planning Board is held prior to the expiration of the thirty-five (35)
day period, the Planning Board shall continue the public hearing to permit the formal
submission of reports and recommendations within that 35 day period. Public hearing
procedures shall comply with the requirements of G.L. c. 40A, s. 9.
3. Planning Board members shall conduct a site visit with the applicant prior to or during
the public hearing.
4. An OSFPD special permit may be issued only following a public hearing held within
sixty-five (65) days after filing an application with the Planning Board.
5. Once an OSFPD special permit application has been submitted, no tree removal, no
utility installation, no ditching, grading or construction of roads, no grading of land or
lots, no excavation, except for purposes of soil testing, no dredging or filling and no
construction of buildings or structures shall be done on any part of the site until the
application (a) has been reviewed and decided as provided by these regulations, or (b) has
been withdrawn and the applicant has obtained other permits for such work.
8.1.19 Decision of the Planning Board for OSFPD Special Permit. The Planning Board shall
take one of the following actions within ninety (90) days following the date of the public hearing
unless extended by written agreement between the Planning Board and the applicant in
accordance with G.L. c. 40A, s. 9.
1. The Planning Board may grant an OSFPD special permit with any conditions,
safeguards, and limitations, considering each of the following criteria in addition to those
in Section 10.5.2:
53
a. The degree to which the conceptual design and layout of the proposed
OSFPD is superior to a conventional development in preserving open space for
conservation and recreation, preserving natural features of the land, achieving
more efficient provision of streets, utilities and other public services, and
providing a high degree of design quality;
b. The degree to which the OSFPD promotes permanent preservation of open
space, agricultural land, forestry land, historical and archeological resources,
existing and proposed trails, wildlife habitat and corridors, and other natural
resources including wetlands and water bodies;
c. The degree to which the OSFPD achieves sustainable design through a more
efficient form of development that consumes less open land and conforms to
existing topography and natural features better than a conventional subdivision;
and
d. The degree to which the OSFPD furthers the goals and policies of the Master
Plan and the purposes of this Section.
2. The Planning Board may deny an OSFPD special permit upon finding that the
application does not comply with the provisions of this Section.
8.1.20 Effect of OSFPD Special Permit Approval. Approval of an OSFPD special permit
under this Section shall not be considered approval of any construction. This approval is a
preliminary approval, intended to give guidance to the applicant for the development of an
OSFPD definitive subdivision plan or a Cluster Design Plan, and to determine whether the
applicant’s submittal meets the objectives of this Section. Approval of an OSFPD special permit
does not indicate approval of the Board of Health, Conservation Commission, or any other entity
from which the development requires separate permits or approvals.
8.1.21 Public Benefit Incentives. In approving an OSFPD special permit, the Planning Board
may authorize an increase in the number of Dwelling Units beyond 1.2 times the Base Maximum
Density. Such increase may be approved only for an OSFPD that provides one (1) or both of the
following public benefits:
1. Additional Common Open Space. For each additional ten (10) percent of the site (over
and above the required fifty (50) percent) set aside as common open space, including
preserving and providing public access to existing walking or riding trails or for
providing connections to existing trails on abutting parcels, an increase of ten (10)
percent of the Base Maximum Density may be approved; provided, however, that the
total number of additional units shall not exceed twenty-five (25) of the Base Maximum
Density. Computations shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
2. Housing for Older Persons. For every one (1) Dwelling Unit restricted to occupancy
by Elderly Persons, the Planning Board may approve an increase of one (1) additional
54
Dwelling Unit; provided, however, that the total number of additional Dwelling Units
approved shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the Base Maximum Density.
Computations shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
3. Limited Public Access to Common Open Space. An increase of ten (10) percent of
the Base Maximum Density may be approved by the Planning Board for limited public
access to the common open space for passive recreation.
In no event shall the Planning Board approve an increase of more than fifty (50) percent of the
Base Maximum Density.
8.1.22 Relationship Between the OSFPD Special Permit and OSFPD Definitive Subdivision
Plan. An OSFPD that involves a subdivision of land may be submitted to the Planning Board
for approval under the Subdivision Control Law following the issuance of an OSFPD special
permit. Planning Board approval of an OSFPD special permit shall neither oblige the Planning
Board to approve any related definitive plan nor substitute for such approval. The OFSPD
definitive subdivision plan shall substantially comply with the OSFPD Concept Plan.
8.1.23 Relationship Between the OSFPD Special Permit and Cluster Design Plan
Approval. The issuance of an OSFPD special permit allows the applicant to submit a Cluster
Design Plan to the Planning Board for review and approval. A Cluster Design Plan shall be
considered neither a subdivision plan under the Subdivision Control Law nor a site plan subject
to the provisions of Section 10.6. No Cluster Design Plan may be filed unless an OSFPD special
permit has been approved and has not lapsed.
8.1.24 Cluster Design Plan Submittal Requirements. The applicant shall submit an
application for Cluster Design Plan approval to the Planning Board, with a copy filed with the
Town Clerk. The size, form, number and contents of the Cluster Design Plan application and
plan requirements shall be set forth in the Planning Board’s OSFPD Rules and Regulations.
1. The Cluster Design Plan shall be designed to conform to the approved OSFPD special
permit.
2. Cluster Design Plan application filing fees shall be governed and set by the Planning
Board in OSFPD Rules and Regulations, and shall be assessed to the owner and/or the
applicant. Separate technical review fees as provided for in state statute may be assessed
for engineering, architectural or other review by one or more consultants selected by the
Planning Board.
8.1.25 Cluster Design Plan Procedures. Cluster Design Plan approval may be issued by the
Planning Board only following a public hearing held within sixty-five (65) days after filing an
application with the Planning Board.
1. The applicant shall furnish sufficient copies of a complete Cluster Design Plan
application for the Planning Board to distribute to the Board of Health, Board of
Selectmen, Building Commissioner, Conservation Commission and Open Space
55
Committee, Department of Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Historic District
Commission, Office on Disability, and Zoning Board of Appeals.
2. Notice of the time, place and subject matter of the public hearing shall be in
accordance with the provisions of G.L. c. 40A, s. 11. Legal notice mailed to abutters shall
be sent by the Planning Board by certified mail at the applicant’s expense. Reports from
other boards and officials shall be submitted to the Planning Board within thirty (30) days
of receipt by the reviewing party. In the event that the public hearing by the Planning
Board is held prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the Planning Board
shall continue the public hearing to permit the formal submission of reports and
recommendations within that thirty (30) day period.
3. The Planning Board shall determine whether the Cluster Design Plan complies with
the requirements of Section 8 within sixty-five (65) days of the public hearing. If no
action is taken within sixty-five (65) days, the application shall be deemed approved as
submitted.
4. Within fifteen (15) days of its vote on the Cluster Design Plan, a copy of the Cluster
Design Plan decision shall be filed with the Town Clerk and the Building Commissioner,
with a copy being sent by certified mail or hand delivered to the applicant. Any
interested party aggrieved by the Cluster Design Plan decision may file an appeal under
the provisions of G.L. c. 40A, s. 17.
5. The Building Commissioner shall not approve any building permit application subject
to these provisions without receipt of Planning Board approval and expiration of the
appeal period, as certified by the Town Clerk.
8.1.26 Cluster Design Plan Decision. The Planning Board shall take one of the following
actions within sixty-five (65) days following the date of the public hearing:
1. The Planning Board shall approve a Cluster Design Plan only upon a determination
that the plan substantially complies with the OSFPD Special Permit and satisfactorily
addresses all of the following criteria:
a. Adequate access to each structure for public safety equipment and personnel;
b. Adequate utility service and drainage, consistent where appropriate with the
Hamilton Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time of the submission of the
site plan;
c. Adequate capacity on impacted streets to accommodate the proposed project,
based on reports received from the Police Department and the Department of
Public Works or technical review consultants retained by the Planning Board;
d. Adequate measures to reduce the volume of cut or fill, soil erosion, and visual
intrusion of parking areas viewed from public ways or abutting properties;
56
e. Protection of pedestrian and vehicular safety within the site and egressing from
it;
f. Compliance with conceptual landscape, building design, and placement of
Buildings;
g. Consistency with the Planning Board’s OSFPD Rules and Regulations; and
h. Compliance with all the other requirements of this By-law.
2. The Planning Board may determine that the Cluster Design Plan does not to comply
substantially with the OSFPD special permit based on any of the following conditions:
a. An increase in the number of Buildings or Dwelling Units;
b. A significant decrease in the open space acreage;
c. A significant change in the general development pattern which adversely
affects natural landscape features and open space preservation;
d. Significant changes to the storm water management facilities; and/or,
e. Significant changes in the wastewater management systems.
3. The Planning Board may conditionally approve a Cluster Design Plan that does not
substantially comply with the OSFPD special permit. However, such conditional
approval must identify where the plan does not substantially comply with the special
permit for the OSFPD Concept Plan and shall require that the special permit be amended
to be in compliance with the significant changes identified by the Planning Board.
4. The Planning Board shall also require that the applicant file an application to amend
the OSFPD special permit within a specified time period. The public hearing on the
application to amend the OSFPD special permit shall be limited to the significant changes
identified by the Planning Board in their conditional approval of the Cluster Design Plan.
These are the only considerations that the Planning Board may take into account in
deciding whether to amend the OSFPD special permit for the Concept Plan.
8.2 SENIOR HOUSING.
8.2.1 Purpose. The purpose of this Section is:
1. To permit the development of moderately priced, affordable, and market rate housing
for Elderly Persons, by allowing for a greater variety of Building types at a higher density
than would normally be allowed;
57
2. To allow greater flexibility in land use planning in order to improve site layouts,
protect natural features and environmental values and utilize land in harmony with
neighboring properties;
3. To encourage the implementation of “Smart Growth” techniques to reduce land
consumption and sprawl, provide for open space preservation, expand housing options,
and encourage re-use of existing Structures;
4. To allow a type of development which has positive fiscal benefits to the Town; and
5. To protect Hamilton’s rural New England character by permitting development of
residential housing in clusters and villages, in a manner which is in harmony with
Hamilton’s historic development patterns and is less demanding on its natural resources.
8.2.2 Eligible Locations. A special permit may be granted for Senior Housing on any Lot(s) in
the R- la, R-1b, R- A, or B Districts that meet the requirements of this Section and other
applicable provisions of this By-law. Parcels in existence as of May 5, 2008, may not be
assembled to create a larger parcel for Senior Housing development.
8.2.3 Administration. The Planning Board shall be the SPGA for this Section. An applicant
may file an application with the Planning Board in conformance with this Section and the
Planning Board Rules and Regulations.
8.2.4 Planning Board Rules and Regulations. The Planning Board shall adopt and from time
to time may amend Senior Housing Special Permit Rules and Regulations to implement this
Section. Such regulations shall include but will not be limited to submission requirements, fees,
plan requirements (such as size, form, number and contents), development standards, site
standards, and standards for Building placement and design. Such rules and regulations are
required and authorized under G.L. c. 40A, s. 9, and shall be adopted after vote by the Planning
Board.
8.2.5 Age Restriction. Each Dwelling Unit in a Senior Housing development shall be owned
and occupied by at least one (1) Elderly Person. All other residents must be over the age of
eighteen (18) years of age.

Town-wide under this Section.
2. A maximum of fifty (50) Dwelling Units per project shall be allowed.
3. The maximum number of Dwelling Units permitted in any year shall be fifty (50).
For the purpose of this Section, a “year” shall mean a calendar year. Any partial year
shall be pro-rated.
58
4. Dwelling Units shall be counted in the calendar year in which the special permit is
granted, not the year in which the application was filed.
5. If fewer than the maximum number of Dwelling Units is permitted in a year, the
balance shall be carried forward to the next year. However, the maximum number of
Dwelling Units permitted per year shall remain at fifty (50).
6. In the event that substantial use or construction under a special permit issued has not
commenced within two (2) years of approval and no extensions have been granted, the
number of Dwelling Units shall be added back into the number of unpermitted Dwelling
Units, and shall be available to be permitted under this Section.

9. Passive recreation;
10. Agricultural, equestrian, and horticultural uses;
11. Accessory Uses, such as a tennis court, pool, community building, and other
amenities, in the developed area, for the benefit of the development;
12. Recreational fields; and
13. In the Business District, a mixture of residential and business uses.
8.2.8 Developable Acres. “Developable Acres” is defined as the area of the tract of land,
exclusive of the area of land lying in the Conservancy District and the area in wetlands subject to
G.L. c. 131, s. 40, as mapped by the applicant’s consultant and approved by the Hamilton
Conservation Commission. In addition, land subject to a preexisting Conservation Restriction,
59
except for land area in a defined “building envelope”, shall be excluded from the total acreage.
This net land area shall constitute “Developable Acres”.
8.2.9 Base Senior Housing Density. The Base Density per Developable Acre for a Senior
Housing special permit shall be: four (4) Dwelling Units in the Business District; three (3)
Dwelling Units in the RI-a District, two (2) Dwelling Units in the Rl-b District, and one (1)
Dwelling Unit in the RA District.
8.2.10 Incentives to Increase Base Senior Housing Density. See the following matrix for

NOTES ON HOW TO READ THE MATRIX:
The Incentives to Increase Base Senior Housing Density may be selected and utilized by an
applicant to increase the Base Senior Housing Density shown in Column B. The percentage
shown in Columns C, D, E, F, G, and Column I would, if selected, increase the number of
Dwelling Units per Developable Acre in Column B, up to the amount shown in Column J,
Maximum Density per Developable Acre.
EXPLANATION OF COLUMNS:
Column A: The existing Zoning Districts in Hamilton.
Column B: The Base Senior Housing Density (BSHD) per Developable Acre. This is the base
acreage that one may apply for in a Senior Housing special permit, without utilizing any of the
Incentives in Columns C, D, E, F, G, and/or I.
61
Column C: Encourages the construction of smaller-sized Dwelling Units. For meeting this
requirement, an applicant earns twenty-five (25) percent more Dwelling Units than what is
shown in Column B.
Column D: Encourages construction of affordable Dwelling Units. Section 8.3, Inclusionary
Housing, requires an affordable housing component for projects of ten (10) or more Dwelling
Units. This column requires that the housing be constructed on-or off-site, rather than meeting
Inclusionary Housing requirements by other authorized methods. For meeting this requirement,
an applicant earns twenty-five (25) percent more Dwelling Units than what is shown in
Column B.
Column E: Encourages the utilization of “Smart Growth” or “Sustainable Development
Principles”, some of which are listed in part in Section 8.2.1. See Planning Board Rules and
Regulations for Smart Growth Principles issued by Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office for
Commonwealth Development. For meeting this requirement, an applicant earns twenty-five (25)
percent more Dwelling Units than what is shown in Column B.
Column F: Encourages the preservation of open space above what is required by this Section.
For meeting this requirement, an applicant earns twenty-five (25) percent more Dwelling Units
than what is shown in Column B.
Column G: Encourages resale prices which will become more affordable for subsequent
purchasers of the Senior Housing Dwelling Units due to a voluntary cap on the allowable rate of
appreciation on sales in future years. A deed restriction (to be included in association
documents) imposed by the applicant, places a cap on appreciation of the resale price of
Dwelling Units. For meeting this requirement, an applicant earns twenty-five (25) percent more
Dwelling Units than what is shown in Column B.
Column H: Represents a sub-total of the incentives in Columns C - G.
Column I: Encourages other initiatives which provide a public benefit to the Town such as, but
not limited to, preservation and enhancement of trails; creation of playing fields; environmental,
energy, water conservation, green building design, and other public benefits. For one (1) or a
combination of these initiatives, an applicant may earn one (1) additional Dwelling Unit per
Developable Acre in the Business, R1-a, and Rl-b Districts, and up to two (2) additional
Dwelling Units per Developable Acre in the RA District.
Column J: Indicates the maximum density per Developable Acre which one may earn by using
a variety of the incentives allowed. Incentives shall be allowed at the discretion of the Planning
Board. The final number shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
8.2.11 Minimum Distance Between Projects. In order to mitigate the impact of multiple
developments on surrounding neighborhoods, a proposed project must be located at least the
distance established in the Minimum Distance Between Projects Table below from any other
existing or approved Senior Housing project, any existing or approved project including
multi-unit residential buildings under G.L. c. 40B, or any existing or approved project including
62
multi-unit residential buildings under any other provision or By-law. Excluded from this
calculation and this Section are any existing multi-family projects approved prior to January 1,
2003, and apartments under Sections 3.4, 3.6 or 3.7.
The minimum distance between projects shall be calculated using the following Table:
Combined Total Dwelling Units in
Proposed Project and in Existing or
Approved Projects
Minimum Distance between Projects
Up to and including 50 total Dwelling Units
0.33 mile
Exceeds 50 total Dwelling Units
0.66 mile
Exceeds 75 total Dwelling Units
1.0 mile
1. The distance between projects shall be measured from the closest property boundary.
Parcels in existence on May 5, 2008 may not be subdivided to avoid application of this
provision. A project shall be deemed to be existing or approved if it has been constructed
or if a special or comprehensive permit, or a site plan approval, has been granted; or if a
special or overlay zoning district which allows multi-family housing has been approved.
2. The determination of the required separation between projects shall be made at the
time the special permit is issued under this By-law, in order to assess the most up to date
existing project status.
3. If a Chapter 40B housing proposal is filed and approved while an application for
Senior Housing special permit has been filed and is under review by the Planning Board,
that Senior Housing project shall be exempt from the distance requirement of this
Section.
4. Senior Housing proposals in the Business District shall be exempt from the provisions
of this Section and developments wholly within the Business District shall not be
considered as existing or approved projects for purposes of establishing required project
separation in any other district.
8.2.12 General Compliance. A proposal must comply with all other applicable Town By-laws,
and the applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of all departments, boards, and
commissions, including the special sensitivities of the Historic District and the Groundwater
Protection Overlay District.
1. Extension or Alteration of Pre-Existing Nonconforming Use. To the extent that such a
finding is required, that approval shall be granted before applying for a Senior Housing
special permit.
63
2. Inclusionary Housing. There shall be compliance with Section 8.3, Inclusionary
Housing. The Town of Hamilton Local Preference Policy shall apply to affordable
Dwelling Units created.
3. Local Preference. The applicant is encouraged to provide a local preference program
for fair market rate Dwelling Units, for an initial limited duration, for the purchase of
Dwellings Units by those eligible under the Local Preference Policy.
8.2.13 General Requirements. The following requirements shall apply.
1. Low Impact Development. The use of low-impact development techniques is required,
where applicable. The applicant shall employ meaningful low impact techniques which
will result in less impervious area, direction of roof runoff toward rain gardens and
swales, and plantings indigenous to the area. The use of recycled or recaptured rainwater
is encouraged. A Low Impact Development Handbook and other references are available
from the Planning Board Office.
2. Minimizing Disturbance. The applicant is encouraged to maintain as much of the site
as possible in its natural state. The applicant is urged to incorporate horticultural and
landscape design that reduces the need for supplemental irrigation and chemical
fertilization, e.g. minimizing lawn area.
3. Location of Wastewater Treatment. All wastewater shall be treated and discharged
on-site. Off-site wastewater treatment is not allowed. An exception to this is for parcels
located in the Business District, where wastewater treatment may be located off-site.
4. Paths and Trails. All existing paths and trails shall be connected, preserved, and
increased when possible.
5. Conversion to Apartments. Dwelling Units constructed by special permit under this
Section shall not be eligible for subsequent conversion to add apartments under Sections
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7.
6. Reuse of Existing Buildings. Existing Buildings and Dwelling Units may be reused
and rehabilitated for the purposes of this Section provided all standards and requirements
are met.
7. Homeowners Association and/or Condominium Documents. Prior to submitting an
application to the Building Commissioner and prior to construction of infrastructure, the
applicant shall submit to the Planning Board and receive approval of all homeowner’s
association and/or condominium documents. The Planning Board or legal counsel shall
review and approve the documents to ensure that the intent of this Section and the
relevant sections of the decision of the Planning Board are incorporated into the
documents.
64
8.2.14 Exemptions. A proposal for a Senior Housing special permit shall be exempt from
Section 10.6, Site Plan Review.
8.2.15 Dimensional Standards. The following dimensional and other standards shall supersede

Note 1. The Planning Board shall require a setback and a vegetated buffer where the
parcel abuts a residential zone.
Note 2. Minimum of twenty-five (25) feet or the height of the Building, whichever is
greater.
8.2.16 Building and Design Standards. In order to achieve a development that reflects the
residential character of the neighborhood in which it is located, the following minimum building
and design standards shall be applied to all Structures constructed in a Senior Housing
development:
1. Dwelling Units shall not contain more than two (2) bedrooms.
2. Buildings shall be designed to be consistent with the residential character of the Town
and shall be complementary in exterior design with each other and, where applicable,
with the existing neighborhood in which the development is located.
3. A mixture of small, medium, and large Dwelling Units is encouraged, in order to
create a range of selling price levels, and to address the needs of various members of the
population.
65
4. A minimum of twenty-five (25) foot separation between Buildings shall be provided
and shall be landscaped.
5. Accessory structures shall comply with all setback requirements and shall be designed
with architectural detailing of similar nature to the principal Buildings located thereon.
6. Other Building and Design Standards in applicable Planning Board Rules and
Regulations shall apply.
8.2.17 Lighting. All lighting fixtures shall be integrated into the architectural style of the
development. All exterior structural and site lighting (not including access road lighting) shall
be localized and of full cut-off design, with light which shall be retained on site and shall not
create a nuisance to abutting properties and streets. All exterior light sources shall be
appropriately shielded from off-premises viewing. Access road lighting shall be designed to
prevent nuisance to abutting properties by reason of light and glare.
8.2.18 Signs. The need for an identifying sign is very site dependent. Accordingly, the
Planning Board shall determine if a sign is needed based on the size, location, and visibility of a
project. If the Planning Board determines that a sign is needed, one (1) sign to identify the
property, no greater than three (3) square feet in size, and mounted on posts with total height
(including the sign) of not more than four (4) feet above the ground, shall be allowed at the
intersection of the project’s access road or driveway with the abutting public way. Signage may

8.3 INCLUSIONARY HOUSING.
8.3.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Inclusionary Housing By-law is to:
1. Produce high-quality Affordable Housing Units to Low or Moderate Income
Households;
2. Encourage more housing choices in Hamilton;
3. Promote geographic distribution of Affordable Housing Units throughout the Town
and avoid over-concentration; and
4. Assist the Town in creating units eligible for the Chapter 40B Subsidized Housing
Inventory through means other than a comprehensive permit.
8.3.2 Applicability. This Section applies to all developments involving the creation of ten (10)
or more Dwelling Units or ten (10) or more Lots for residential use.
Developments may not be segmented to avoid compliance with this Section. Divisions of land
that would cumulatively result in an increase by ten (10) or more residential Lots or Dwelling
Units above the number existing on any parcel or any contiguous parcels in common ownership
in the twenty-four (24) months prior to any application for development under this By-law or the
subdivision control law are subject to this Section. For purposes of this Section, a division of
land shall mean any division of land subject to G.L. c. 41, s. 81K-81GG.
8.3.3 Mandatory Provision of Affordable Housing Units. In any development subject to this
Section, the tenth Dwelling Unit and every seventh unit thereafter shall be an Affordable
Housing Unit. Nothing in this Section shall preclude a developer from providing more
Affordable Housing Units than are required hereunder.
8.3.4 Methods of Providing Affordable Housing Units. The Planning Board may approve one
(1) or more of the following methods, or any combination thereof, for the provision of
Affordable Housing Units:
1. The Affordable Housing Units may be constructed or rehabilitated on the locus of the
development.
2. The Affordable Housing Units may be constructed or rehabilitated on a locus different
from that of the development. The Planning Board may allow a developer of non-rental
Dwelling Units to develop, construct or otherwise provide Affordable Housing Units
reasonably equivalent to those required by this Section in an off-site location in the Town
of Hamilton. All requirements that apply to on-site provision of Affordable Housing
Units shall apply to provision of off-site Affordable Housing Units. In addition, the
location of the off-site Affordable Housing Units shall be approved by the Planning
Board as an integral element of the development review and approval process.
71
3. A donation of land may be made in lieu of providing Affordable Housing Units. An
applicant may offer, and the Planning Board may accept, subject to approval of the Board
of Selectmen, donations of land in fee simple, on-or off-site, that the Planning Board
determines are suitable for the construction of an equivalent number of Affordable
Housing Units. Land donated for this purpose shall be subject to a restriction assuring its
use for affordable housing. Prior to accepting land as satisfaction of the requirements of
this Section, the Planning Board may require the applicant to submit an appraisal or other
data relevant to the determination of suitability for an equivalent number of Affordable
Housing Units.
4. An equivalent fee in lieu of units may be made. The Planning Board may allow a
developer of non-rental Dwelling Units to make a cash payment to the Town through its
Affordable Housing Trust Fund for each Affordable Housing Unit required herein. The
cash payment per unit shall be in accordance with the following formula: two times an
amount equal to eighty (80) percent of area median income for a Family of four (4) in the
metropolitan or non-metropolitan area that includes the Town of Hamilton, as determined
annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
8.3.5 General Provisions. The Planning Board shall be charged with administering this Section
and shall promulgate Inclusionary Housing Rules and Regulations, including but not limited to
submission requirements and procedures, application and review fees, minimum requirements
for a marketing plan, and documentation required by the Town to qualify the Affordable
Housing Units for listing on the Chapter 40B Subsidized Housing Inventory.
1. Affordable Housing Units shall be dispersed throughout the Building(s) in a
development and shall be comparable to market housing units in terms of location,
quality and character, room size, bedroom distribution, and external appearance.
2. The selection of qualified purchasers or qualified renters shall be carried out under a
marketing plan approved by the Planning Board and shall comply with Local Initiative
Program guidelines. The marketing plan must describe how the applicant will
accommodate local preference requirements, if any, established by the Board of
Selectmen.
3. Developers may sell Affordable Housing Units to the Town of Hamilton, the
Hamilton Housing Authority, or to any non-profit housing development organization that
serves the Town of Hamilton, in order that such entity may carry out the steps needed to
market the Affordable Housing Units and manage the choice of buyers.
4. Developers shall be responsible for preparing applications and other documentation
required by the Department of Housing And Community Development (DHCD) to assure
that the Affordable Housing Units are eligible for listing on the Chapter 40B Subsidized
Housing Inventory.
72
8.3.6 Timing of Construction. Unless a different schedule is approved by the Planning Board,
Affordable Housing Units shall be provided in proportion to the development of market-rate
units, but in no event shall the construction of Affordable Housing Units, the payment of fees in
lieu of constructing Affordable Housing Units, or the provision of off-site Affordable Housing
Units be delayed beyond the schedule below. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number.

(Note: Construction or alteration in Conservancy District will usually also require application to
the Hamilton Conservation Commission under the Wetlands Protection Act and the Hamilton
Wetlands By-law.)
9.3.3 Special Permit. Subject to a special permit by the Zoning Board of Appeals under
specified conditions as provided for in Section 10.5, and only when the Conservation
Commission has reported to the Zoning Board of Appeals that such activities will not have
adverse effects relating to water quality or recharge, upstream or downstream flooding and
drainage, and water storage capacity in the Conservancy-District, the following uses are
permitted:
1. Nonresidential Buildings and Structures, such as boathouses, duckwalks and landings;
2. Stands for sale of produce raised on the premises, provided that any such Building or
Structure permitted by the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be designed, placed and
constructed to offer minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be firmly
anchored to prevent floating away and thus threatening other buildings or blocking of
openings in restricted sections of the watercourse below (Note: Special permit and site
plan review required per Sections 10.5 and 10.6.);
3. Dams, changes in watercourses, or drainage works, only as part of an over-all
drainage basin plan;
82
4. Uses, whether or not on the same parcel as activities permitted as a matter of right,
which activities are necessary in connection with scientific research or scientific
development or related production provided the Zoning Board of Appeals finds that the
proposed use does not substantially derogate from the public good, and that the proposed
use does not include impermeable ground cover in excess of 10% of the total lot area, or
any storage of chemical substances which have the potential for degrading groundwater
quality. (Site plan review under Section 10.6);
5. Wind Energy Facilities and Utility Scale Wind Energy Facilities, subject to the
standards set forth in Section 7.3; and
6. When any land shown on the Zoning Map as being in the Conservancy District is
proven to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of Appeals, after reference of the proof to
and report by the Conservation Commission, Planning Board and Board of Health, as
being in fact not subject to flooding or not unsuitable because of drainage conditions for
residential use, and that neither construction activities nor the use of such land for
residence will interfere with the general purposes for which Conservancy Districts have
been established, and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may, by grant of a special permit, permit the use of such land
for Single Family Dwellings under all the provisions of this By-law applying to the
Residence District in which the land lies.

speed drainage through or around a natural watershed, thereby reducing opportunities for
water quality renovation by percolation or infiltration through soils; and
9. Alteration of terrain which may result in increased discharge of stormwater runoff into
the District.
83
9.3.5 Reversion. If for any reason the restrictions or requirements contained in this Section
shall be or become invalid as to any land shown on the Zoning Map as being in the Conservancy
District, then such land shall thereafter be subject to the regulation for the district in which the
land lies.
9.4 ESTATE OVERLAY DISTRICT (EOD).
9.4.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Estate Overlay District (“EOD”) is:
1. To allow for the preservation of the buildings and land of large estate properties while
allowing for appropriate development which has a positive net fiscal benefit to the Town
and is an alternative to the subdivision of an estate property;
2. To allow for the efficient use of such land in harmony with the natural features of the
district while preserving open space for conservation, agricultural, or recreational use,
and providing appropriate public access to open space;
3. To protect natural features that are important to the character of the town, including
public vistas of fields, lakes, and rivers from town roads as well as the existing nonvehicular
connections through trails and pathways; and
4. To protect Hamilton’s rural and agricultural New England character and provide for
its continued uses by permitting a mix of commercial and residential development in a
manner which is in harmony with Hamilton’s historic development patterns.
9.4.2 Overview. The Estate Overlay District By-law is a special district overlaying the R-la,
R-1b and RA districts. The EOD has two (2) distinct subsections:
1. Part A - An Estate House Adaptive Reuse Permit, which allows for new commercial
uses as well as currently allowed and expanded residential uses in existing Estate
Houses; and
2. Part B - An Estate House Adaptive Reuse and New Floor Area Construction for
Commercial Use Permit, which allows for new commercial and expanded residential uses
in the existing Estate House and new construction to create space for commercial use in
an addition or in an associated Building.
Both Part A and Part B are allowed by special permit. An applicant must apply for Part A first
and choose to file a separate special permit application for Part B after an occupancy permit has
been issued for Part A.
9.4.3 Applicability. A property in the EOD is eligible for a Part A special permit if it has a
minimum Lot size of fifteen (15) acres, and is eligible for a Part B special permit if it has a
minimum Lot size of twenty (20) acres. In calculating the Lot size:
1. Contiguous Lots may be combined provided that:
84
a. At least one (1) of the Lots contains an Estate House of over five thousand
(5,000) Residential Gross Square Feet of living area, built before December 31,
1950;
b. The Lots as combined have the required acreage; and
c. The Lots have been under common ownership prior to July 1, 2010.
3. Lots may be considered combined regardless of whether a private or public road
dissects the parcels.
4. Land restricted by conservation easements/restrictions or wetlands will count toward
the fifteen (15) acre and twenty (20) acre thresholds.
9.4.4 Access Requirements for the EOD. Access to the Lot must be through existing frontage
on a public way or through existing frontage on a private way if all abutters to the entire length
of the private way agree in writing to the development proposal.
9.4.5 Open Space Requirement. An EOD project must contain a minimum of forty (40)
percent open space. The following options shall be used to meet this requirement:
1. A minimum of forty (40) percent of the parcel must already be or shall be conveyed to
the Town and accepted by it for open space use;
2. A minimum of forty (40) percent of the parcel must be made subject to a conservation
restriction prepared in accordance with the provision of G.L. c. 184, ss. 31-33, running in
favor of either the Town or, upon the approval of the Board of Selectmen with advice
from the Planning Board, to a non-profit corporation, the principal purpose of which is
the conservation of open space;
3. Land that has already been made subject to a conservation restriction as delineated
above shall count toward the forty (40) percent threshold;
4. No more than fifty (50) percent of the required open space shall consist of resource
areas subject to the Wetlands Protection Act, G .L. c. 131, s. 40, (excepting the resource
area “isolated land subject to flooding”) or land within the Conservancy District;
5. Land used for common or shared septic systems may not be counted toward the
minimum common open space requirement unless authorized by the Planning Board.
9.4.6 Open Space Access. Unless the applicant can provide a compelling reason to the
Planning Board why public access would be infeasible, a portion of the open space shall be
available for public access and use, for example, wildlife corridors, water protection, view-sheds,
trails or other access which provides a public benefit. The Planning Board shall take into
account the size of the parcel, the customary and agricultural uses, and whether or not it can
85
provide adequate parking and other facilities to allow for public use. If the property size or
structure cannot meet public parking requirements, or if public use does not fit with the character
of the neighborhood, the Planning Board may restrict public use.
9.4.7 Review Criteria. The Planning Board is the SPGA for the EOD and shall apply the
provisions of Section 10.5.2 consistent with the purposes set forth in Section 9.4.1.
9.4.8 Advisory Opinions. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of a special permit application in
the EOD, the Planning Board shall transmit copies of the application to the Economic
Development Committee, Historical District Commission, Board of Health, Department of
Public Works, Conservation Commission, Zoning Board of Appeals, and the Fire and Police
Departments for their review and advisory opinions, which shall be submitted within thirty (30)
days.
9.4.9 Phasing. Phasing in the EOD, as approved by the Planning Board, shall be permitted
either pursuant to phasing described in the initial special permit application or in a subsequent
special permit application. The special permit approval shall not be deemed to have lapsed as
long as the applicant shall have commenced use of the phasing time frames set forth in the
special permit application. The Planning Board shall have the authority to require one or more
performance bonds or other similar mechanisms if it determines that such mechanisms are
necessary to ensure that the key components or phase of a project are satisfactorily completed.
9.4.10 Pre-Application Conference. The applicant shall request and attend an EOD preapplication
review at a regular business meeting of the Planning Board. The Planning Board
shall invite the Board of Health, Building Commissioner, Conservation Commission and Open
Space Committee, Department of Public Works, Fire Chief, Police Chief, Historic District
Commission, Office on Disability, and Zoning Board of Appeals to attend the pre-application
conference. The primary purpose of the EOD special permit pre-application conference is to
identify the site’s natural or historically important features, riding or walking trails on the site
and abutting parcels, public safety, traffic or infrastructure issues, and areas the Town prefers to
see preserved as open space, for agricultural or equestrian uses. The secondary purpose of a preapplication
review is to minimize the applicant’s cost of engineering and other technical experts,
and to commence discussions with the Planning Board at the earliest possible stage of
development. Meetings may be held by mutual agreement of the Planning Board and the
applicant. At the pre-application review, the applicant shall outline the proposed Estate Overlay
District proposal, seek preliminary feedback from the Planning Board, and set a timetable for
submittal of a formal application. At the expense of the applicant, the Planning Board may
engage technical experts to review the informal plans of the applicant and to facilitate submittal
of a formal application for an Estate Overlay District special permit.
9.4.11 EOD Special Permit Design Process.
1. Identify Conservation Areas. The first step in the design process requires
identification of conservation areas on the site, including wetlands, areas located in the
Hamilton Conservancy District, riverfront areas, and floodplains regulated by state,
federal, or local law, unprotected natural landscape features such as steep slopes, mature
86
woodlands, prime farmland, meadows, wildlife habitats and wildlife corridors or
connections thereto, cultural features such as historic and archeological sites and scenic
views, and recreational features such as established trails used for horseback riding,
walking and cross-country skiing. To the maximum extent feasible, conservation areas
shall include areas identified by the Planning Board during the pre-application
conference.
2. Identify and Delineate the Proposed Development Area. The second step in the
design process is to define and delineate the area that will contain buildings, roadways,
other site improvements and amenities for the development. To the maximum extent
feasible, the proposed development area shall consist of land outside the identified
conservation areas.
3. Locate Dwelling and Commercial Units. The third step in the design process is to
identify and delineate the approximate location of Dwelling Units or commercial units in
the existing Estate House or commercial units in the proposed development area. The
location, height, density, and architectural treatment of all Buildings proposed for
construction, renovation or re-use should be included.
4. Locate Open Space. The fourth step in the design process is to identify and delineate
the open space to be dedicated along with any potential uses.
5. Roads and Trails. The fifth step in the design process is to identify and delineate the
approximate location of roads, parking area and trails. Roads shall be aligned to access
the Dwelling Units and commercial units. The layout of new trails should anticipate
internal and external connections to existing and/or potential future roads, trails and
sidewalks.
6. Utilities. The type and probable location of the proposed utilities should be included.
9.4.12 Certification. The special permit plan should be accompanied by a certification or letter
from the Hamilton Historical District Commission of all Historically, Culturally and/or
Architecturally Significant Buildings, landscape features and supporting Structures located on
the site if the applicant intends on using this determination as a way to obtain new floor area.
9.4.13 Special Permit Application. All special permit applications for an EOD shall be made
and filed with the special permit application form. For an application to be considered complete,
it shall provide all information required by the Planning Board’s Rules and Regulations
Governing Special Permits. The special permit application shall also be accompanied by
certification from the Hamilton Historical Commission of all Historically, Culturally and/or
Architecturally Significant Buildings (if applying for the bonus square footage for renovation
under Part B), a plan of all existing and proposed Buildings, landscape features and supporting
Structures located on the site and by nine (9) copies of a site development report. The site
development report should include, at minimum, an inventory and analysis of:
87
1. Natural resource features, wildlife and their habitat;
2. All Buildings and Structures;
3. Pedestrian and vehicular access to the site;
4. Public safety issues;
5. Provision of landscaping/buffering;
6. Protection of wildlife habitats;
7. Provision of utilities;
8. Open space and recreation, including trail development and/or maintenance;
9. Water supply and drainage issues;
10. Layout and density of site development;
11. Preservation and rehabilitation of the exterior features, character and structural
integrity of the estate house, and the open space, vistas, stonework, gardens, and other
historic features and supporting Structures;
12. Building design and materials, including exterior elevations of existing and proposed
buildings and additions;
13. Proposed uses for commercial units;
14. Trails or pathways provided or maintained to connect pedestrian, equestrian, nonmotorized-
bicycle riders or skiers to sites within the property and to other public trail
systems if possible; and
15. To the extent possible, the information provided in the report shall be shown in plans
and map form, accompanied by written narrative.
9.4.14 Criteria. In addition to the criteria set forth in Section 10.5.2, the Planning Board shall
consider the feasibility of the project given the size, location and scope of the property,
proximity to abutters, safety concerns, impact on the property, and whether the proposed use is
compatible with the character of the Town of Hamilton and the neighborhood the property is
located within.
9.4.15 Modifications. Any new use or change of use will require an amendment of the EOD
special permit by the Planning Board.
88
EOD Part A - Estate House Adaptive Reuse.
9.4.16 Part A. Estate House Adaptive Reuse allows for the estate owner to apply for a special
permit from the Planning Board to use the Estate House in accordance with one of the following
adaptive reuse criteria. Special permits allow for each application to be considered individually
based on their specific location and impact to the existing neighborhood. Throughout this
Section, residential units are limited to two (2) bedrooms each. This is designed to achieve the
goal of providing alternative housing for groups that do not currently have housing options
within the Town. The Planning Board may, in its sole discretion, allow a developer to increase
the number of bedrooms to a maximum of three (3), provided the developer can demonstrate a
compelling reason why such increase serves the stated goals of the EOD.
9.4.17 Part A - Permitted Uses. The following use or a combination of the following uses may
be permitted in the original Estate House under Part A:
1. Any uses listed in the Table of Uses as an allowable use in the zoning district in which
the property currently exists, whether by special permit or otherwise;
2. Multi-family condominium, cooperative, and apartment residential Dwelling Units,
provided that residential units shall be limited to no more than two (2) bedrooms per unit;
or to thre (3) bedrooms if permitted by the Planning Board pursuant to Section 9.4.16
above;
3. For profit function halls, meeting rooms, inns, Bed and Breakfasts, spas, and
Restaurants (excluding Fast Food or Drive In or Drive Through Establishments);
4. For Profit Educational Facilities;

Assisted Living Residence; and
7. Museums.
9.4.18 Part A - Dimensional Requirements. A minimum vegetated buffer strip of three
hundred (300) feet shall be provided unless the Building is nearer to the abutting property line or
at least one hundred (100) feet, provided that the Planning Board may increase the vegetated
buffer strip based on factors that shall include, but not be limited to: the size and location of the
parcel, the character of the neighborhood and the intended use.
9.4.19 Part A - Special Permit Application. All Part A special permit applications shall
include building plans prepared by a registered architect and filed with the special permit
application form. For an application to be considered complete, it shall provide all information
required by the Hamilton Planning Board Rules and Regulations Governing Special Permits.
89
9.4.20 Part A - Required Information. The special permit application shall include a plan of
the existing Estate House and nine (9) copies of a Site Re-use Report. The Site Re-use Report
should include an outline of how the following issues and impacts will be addressed by the reuse:
1. Pedestrian and vehicular access to the site including anticipated changes to vehicular
traffic patterns;
2. Public safety issues;
3. Provision of landscaping/buffering;
4. Open space and recreation, including trail development and/or maintenance;
5. Water supply and drainage issues;
6. Proposed uses for commercial units, if any;
7. Conceptual floor plans for units;
8. Trails or pathways will be provided or maintained to connect pedestrian, equestrian,
non-motorized-bicycle riders or skiers to sites within the property and to other public trail
systems if possible; and
9. To the extent possible, the information provided in the report shall be shown in
building and site plans, accompanied by a written narrative describing the proposed
adaptive reuse.
EOD Part B - New Floor Area Construction
9.4.21 Part B. New Floor Area construction allows for the estate owner to improve the existing
Estate House with expanded residential and commercial uses while increasing floor space by
construction of an addition to the original Estate House and/or constructing an associated
Building for commercial uses as indicated below. The New Floor Area uses are limited to
commercial only. The new uses may be allowed by special permit with the Planning Board
acting as the SPGA. Special permits allow for each application to be considered individually
based on their specific location and impact to the existing neighborhood.
9.4.22 Part B - Permitted Uses. Along with those uses allowed in Part A, the following single
commercial use or a combination of the following commercial uses may be permitted in the New
Floor Area under Part B (note that residential use is not permitted in any New Floor Area under
Part B):
1. Outdoor recreational facility or center such as cross country skiing, golf, horseback
riding, or non-motorized cross country bike riding facility including any on-site trails;
90
2. Long Term Care Facility providing continuing residential care for seniors or the
infirm; and
3. Additional uses which are consistent with the objective and intention of this Section
and the character of the neighborhood.
9.4.23 Part B - Methods of Achieving New Floor Area. There are three methods to obtain
New Floor Area to construct commercial space on the property in addition to re-use of the
original Estate House. The methods are intended to promote development which encourages
preservation of both Hamilton’s historic buildings and open space.
1. Historic Rehabilitation of the Original Estate House. An application that proposes to
rehabilitate or renovate Buildings and supporting Structures certified by the Hamilton
Historic District Commission as being Historically, Culturally, or Architecturally
Significant may increase New Floor Space by three times the amount of square footage
contained in all existing Buildings that are rehabilitated or renovated as part of the EOD
development. The Planning Board shall refer to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings for guidance when
reviewing the Buildings which have been, or are proposed to be, rehabilitated or
renovated.
2. Non-historic Rehabilitation of Original Estate House. If the Planning Board
determines that the reconstruction or replacement of existing Buildings or supporting
Structures that have not been certified by the Hamilton Historic District Commission as
being Historically, Culturally or Architecturally Significant are more consistent with the
Building’s rehabilitation or renovation, then the applicant may increase New Floor Area
by the amount of square footage contained in all existing Buildings that are rehabilitated
or reconstructed. The renovated or rehabilitated Building or supporting Structure may
not be torn down.
3. Yield Analysis Plan of Developable Land. For the purpose of this By-law, two
thousand (2,000) square feet of New Floor Area may be constructed for each Lot that
could be created on the property as shown by a Yield Analysis Plan with a maximum of
thirty-thousand (30,000) of additional square feet of New Floor Area obtained from this
subsection. The applicant shall provide with the application for special permit a Yield
Analysis Plan together with verifiable soil tests indicating the number of buildable lots
possible under single family zoning, the State Environmental Code, Title V, the
requirements of the Board of Health, the Wetlands Protection Act, and the Hamilton
Conservation By-law and Rules and Regulations. Such soil tests shall be conducted as if
they were actually percolation tests in accordance with the above-referenced
requirements and shall be verified and attested to by a registered professional engineer.
Buildable lot calculation can only apply to land that is not under current restriction
(excluding G.L. c. 61A or c. 61B).
91
9.4.24 Part B - Dimensional Requirements. The following dimensional requirements apply
in Part B:
1. Newly constructed or renovated buildings in an EOD must be thirty-five (35) feet or
lower in height unless the original Estate House is greater than thirty-five (35) feet high
in which case, newly constructed or renovated additions or any other new Buildings will
be limited to the height of the original Estate House, but in no case greater than four (4)
stories;
2. Newly constructed Buildings shall be clustered within one hundred (100) feet of the
original Estate House unless the developer has a specific goal consistent with the
purposes of this By-law that allows for placement of the newly constructed Buildings
outside of this area that achieves the cohesive integration of the new Buildings into the
whole;
3. In no event will new construction within the three-hundred (300) foot buffer be
permitted any nearer the property line than the greater of at least one hundred (100) feet
or the distance from the property line of the current Building; and
4. A vegetated buffer strip with a minimum depth of fifty (50) feet shall be provided
between the Buildings of an EOD and any public or private way provided that the
Planning Board may increase the vegetated buffer strip based on factors that shall

9.5 WILLOW STREET OVERLAY DISTRICT (WSOD).
9.5.1 Purpose. The general purpose of the Willow St. Overlay District (WSOD) is to encourage
planned and orderly development of land within the boundaries of the WSOD. These areas are
designated for special land use, planning, environmental, and access considerations that warrant
careful control of development under a special permit procedure using appropriate standards.
The specific purposes of the WSOD are the following:
1. To support land uses and activities that will promote economic development in
Hamilton, thereby generating substantial increases in net tax revenue from new
development and business growth as well as additional local jobs;
2. To allow for the phased development of new uses and activities that are appropriate
and desirable for the WSOD, based on planning and market oppo1iunities identified in
the Hamilton Master Plan;
3. To provide for mitigation of any negative impacts caused by new development,
including but not limited to transportation and environmental impacts;
92
4. To incorporate into the design review and permitting process input from Hamilton’s
land use boards, nearby residential abutters and citizens; and
5. To improve the aesthetics, vibrancy and quality of life for the neighborhoods that
include the downtown business district.
9.5.2 Location. The Willow Street Overlay District shall consist of an area within the Business
District, west of the railroad tracks and along Willow Street from Asbury Street, including 203
Willow Street.
9.5.3 Applicability. The WSOD provides for additional uses through a special permit process.
All underlying uses remain available to property owners. If a property owner elects to apply for
a special permit to develop in accordance with the WSOD, the provisions of this Section shall
apply. All underlying zoning district requirements still apply, unless they are superseded by this
Section. By filing an application for a special permit under this Section, the owner shall be
deemed to accept and agree to the terms and provisions set forth herein.
If the owner elects to proceed under the zoning provisions of the underlying district, the zoning
By-laws applicable in the underlying district shall control and the provisions of the Willow Street
Overlay District shall not apply.
9.5.4 Permitted Uses. In addition to the uses provided in the underlying zoning district, the
following additional uses shall be permitted in the WSOD:
1. Athletic facilities;
2. Accessory infrastructure facilities;
3. Retail or Restaurant;

10.6 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
10.6.1 Purpose. Site plan review is intended to allow the Town to review and impose
reasonable conditions on development, allowed as of right or by special permit, which by its
nature or location has the potential for significant impacts on traffic circulation, public safety,
public utilities, the environment and neighborhood character and appearance. The purpose is to
provide a mechanism and a process for fitting the proposed development to neighborhood
character, scale, and infrastructure, and to reasonably protect the Town and abutting property
owners from potential negative impacts. These purposes are to be served by providing for
consistent submissions of thorough data for each proposal for Town review; and for
consideration by Town boards as specified below, in terms of specific criteria; and for issuance
of a site plan decision setting whatever terms and conditions, if any, are necessary to achieve the
purposes of site plan review, consistent with Town By-laws and regulations. Provision is made
to exempt small modifications and improvements from portions of this Section, and to coordinate
site plan review with other required review of special permits and alteration of nonconforming
uses and structures.
10.6.2 Projects Requiring Approval. No building permit shall be applied for or issued for any
construction or alteration subject to this Section, as specified below, until a site plan has been
approved or conditionally approved by the Planning Board as set forth herein. Except as
exempted in the By-law, site plan review shall be required for the following construction,
alterations, and uses:
1. Any new construction or alteration or expansion of, or conversion to a business,
office, industrial, institutional, or multi-family residence Building or Structure in any
district;

government buildings and structures, farm stands, and Buildings in commercial, and/or
office use;
4. Industrial and scientific research use under Section 3.2;
5. Stables providing boarding and/or services for more than six (6) horses other than
those owned by the residents of the Lot on which the stable is located;
6. Greenhouses for commercial production of plants or produce;
7. Interior alterations which increase the commercial, industrial, institutional or multifamily
floor area within an existing Building, and/or which change the number of
separately leasable or saleable spaces within an existing Building; and
8. Wind Energy Facilities in the Commercial Overlay District.
10.6.3 Projects Requiring Abbreviated Site Plan Review. Proposed additions or alterations to
existing Buildings subject to site plan review which would either add new floor area totaling less
than ten (10) percent of the current ground floor area of the existing Building, or which are
estimated to cost less than ten (10) percent of the current one hundred (100) percent assessed
valuation of the Building shall require only abbreviated site plan review as provided below. For
purposes of applying this guideline, when ground floor area includes attached residential floor
area or attached commercial greenhouses, the area of the residential and/or greenhouse portions
shall be deducted before applying the ten (10) percent threshold factors.
10.6.4 Exemptions from Site Plan Review. The following activities shall not require site plan
review or abbreviated site plan review:
1. Interior alterations unless the alterations increase the floor area within the building
devoted to any of the uses listed in Section 10.6.2 and/or change the number of separately
leasable or saleable spaces within the Building. Examples of exempt interior alterations
are: paneling, shelving, partitions other than those creating new commercial units,
counters, flooring and general interior decoration;
2. Repairs, repainting, residing, reroofing and window replacement unless the activity
also increases floor area;

plan review with generally identical portions. Total replacement of such a destroyed
Building shall require site plan review;
109
4. Demolition of a Building or Structure;

10.8 REQUEST FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION.
10.8.1 Purpose. Under the requirements of the Federal Housing Act (“FHA”), it is a
discriminatory practice to refuse to make “a reasonable accommodation in rules, policies,
practices, or services when such accommodation may be necessary to afford [a handicapped]
person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(3)(B). The same
standard applies under the Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which also addresses
nonresidential facilities providing services to persons with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. §12112(b)(5).
The purpose of this Section is to facilitate housing and/or services for persons with disabilities
and to comply fully with the spirit and the letter of the FHA and, where applicable, the ADA.
10.8.2 Request. Any person eligible under the FHA or any provider of housing to persons
eligible under the FHA, or any person eligible to operate a nonresidential facility providing
services to persons eligible under the ADA, may request a reasonable accommodation as
provided by the FHA and/or the ADA. A request for a reasonable accommodation does not
affect a person’s or provider’s obligations to act in compliance with other applicable laws and
regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.
10.8.3 Zoning Board of Appeals. All requests for reasonable accommodation under the FHA
and/or the ADA shall be submitted to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
116
10.8.4 Information. All requests for a reasonable accommodation under the FHA and/or the
ADA shall be in writing and provide, at a minimum, the following information:
1. Name and address of person (s) or entity requesting accommodation;
2. Name and address of property owner;
3. Name and address of dwelling or facility at which accommodation is requested;
4. Description of the requested accommodation and specific regulation or regulations for
which accommodation is sought;
5. Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the person or persons
with disabilities to use and enjoy the premises; and
6. If the requested accommodation relates to the number of persons allowed to occupy a
dwelling, the anticipated number of residents, including facility staff (if any).
If necessary to reach a decision on the request for reasonable accommodation, the Zoning Board
of Appeals may request further information from the applicant consistent with the FHA and/or
ADA, specifying in detail the information required.
10.8.5 Zoning Board of Appeals Procedures. The deadlines imposed in G.L. c. 40A, s. 11 or
s. 15 may be extended upon the request of the applicant and the approval of the Zoning Board of
Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals may seek information from other Town agencies in
assessing the impact of the requested accommodation on the rules, policies, and procedures of
the Town. Upon written notice to the Zoning Board of Appeals, an applicant for a reasonable
accommodation may withdraw the request without prejudice. The Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider the following criteria when deciding whether a request for accommodation is
reasonable:
1. Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration of a
legitimate Town policy; and
2. Whether the requested accommodation would impose undue financial or
administrative burdens on the Town government.
10.8.6 Decision. After conducting an appropriate inquiry into the request for a reasonable
accommodation, the Zoning Board of Appeals may:
1. Grant the request;
2. Grant the request subject to specified conditions; or
3. Deny the request.
117
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall issue a written final decision on the request in accordance
with G.L. c. 40A, s. 15. If the Zoning Board of Appeals fails to render its decision on a request
for a reasonable accommodation within the time allotted by G.L. c. 40A, s. 15, the request shall
be deemed granted. The Zoning Board of Appeals’ decision shall be filed with the Town Clerk
and sent to the applicant by certified mail.
10.8.7 Appeal. The Zoning Board of Appeals’ decision pursuant to this Section may be
appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with G.L. c. 40A, s. 17 or otherwise.
10.8.8 File. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain a file of all requests for reasonable
accommodation under the FHA and/or the ADA and a file of all decisions made on such
requests. The file(s) may be reviewed in the office of the Zoning Board of Appeals upon request
during regular business hours.
10.8.9 Other Laws. While a request for a reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and
regulations otherwise applicable to the premises that are the subject of the request shall remain in
full force and effect.
10.8.10. Effective Date. The provisions of this Section shall apply only to requests for
reasonable accommodation made after adoption of this By-law. Any person who has previously
submitted a request for a reasonable accommodation may resubmit the request for processing
pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Hamilton Planning Board

Before making any division of land in Hamilton, the subdivider is required by law to secure from the Hamilton Planning Board approval, or endorsement as “approval not required”, of the plan for the proposed division. The regulations set out below, indicate the requirements to be met and the procedure to be followed before such approval or endorsement can be obtained.

PURPOSE

“The subdivision control law has been enacted for the purpose of protecting the safety, convenience and welfare of the inhabitants of the cities and towns in which it is, or may hereafter be, put in effect by regulating the laying out and construction of ways in subdivisions providing access to the several lots therein, but which have not become public ways, and ensuring sanitary conditions in subdivisions and in proper cases parks and open areas. The powers of a planning board and of a board of appeal under the subdivision control law shall be exercised with due regard for the provision of adequate access to all of the lots in a subdivision by ways that will be safe and convenient for travel; for lessening congestion in such ways and in the adjacent public ways; for reducing danger to life and limb in the operation of motor vehicles; for securing safety in the case of fire, flood, panic and other emergencies; for ensuring compliance with the applicable zoning ordinances or by-laws; for securing adequate provisions for water, sewerage, drainage, and other requirements where necessary in a subdivision; and for coordinating the ways in a subdivision with each other and with the public ways in the city or town in which it is located and with the ways in neighboring subdivisions…..”

SECTION III : GENERAL
A. Definitions:

For the purposes of these Rules and Regulations the words and terms used herein are hereby defined or the meaning thereof explained, extended or limited as stated in Chapter 41 of the General Laws as amended, and as follows:

Board The Planning Board of the Town of Hamilton.

By Right Plan. A By-Right Plan demonstrates that the proposed lot can be subdivided in compliance with all zoning and subdivision control laws without variances or waiver

Major Street. A street which, in the opinion of the Board, is being used or will be used as a thoroughfare across or between different portions of the Town or which will otherwise carry a heavy volume of traffic.

Minor Street. A street which, in the opinion of the Board, is being used or will be used primarily, to provide access to abutting lots, and which is designed to discourage its use by through traffic.

Secondary Street. A street intercepting one or more minor streets and which, in the opinion of the Board, is used or will be used to carry a substantial volume of traffic from such minor street(s) to a major street or community facility, and normally including the principal entrance street of a large subdivision, or group of subdivisions, and any principal circulation streets within such subdivisions.

Subdivision. A division of land into two or more lots in such a manner as to constitute “subdivision”, as defined in Section 81-L, Ch. 41 of the General Laws.

Recorded Recorded in the South Essex Registry of Deeds; or, as affecting registered land, it shall mean filed with the recorder of the Land Court.

B. Plan Believed Not to Require Approval. (Wording adapted from Section 81 of Chapter 41.)

Any person who wishes to cause to be recorded a plan of land situated in Hamilton and who believes that his plan does not require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, may submit his application Form A (Appendix) and his plan, with seven contact prints thereof, to the Planning Board, accompanied by the necessary evidence to show that the plan does not require approval. If the parcels created are building lots, an application fee of $250. plus $100. for each lot in the subdivision, whether newly created or modified, shall accompany the filing of the Form A at the time of submission. (Fees: Added 2/89, amended 9/01.) Said person shall file in the manner prescribed in Section 81 T of Chapter 41 G.L. by delivery or registered mail, a notice with the Town Clerk stating the date of submission for such determination. The Board will review the Plan for relation of proposed lots to the Zoning By-law, to the General or Master Plan, and to the requirements for health and drainage, etc.; and consult with the applicant. The Planning Board may require the applicant to pay a review fee to cover the reasonable costs of consultants engaged by the Planning Board to assist in review of the proposed plans, as authorized and limited by M.G.L. Ch. 44, Sec. 53 G and Sec. VII. D. of these Subdivision Regulations. (Review Fees: Added 6/90)

If the Board determines that the plan does not require approval, the Board or its agent shall without a public hearing and within twenty-one (21) days of submission endorse on the plan the words “Planning Board approval under Subdivision Control Law not required,” or words of similar import. Such endorsement shall not be deemed to constitute any determination of compliance with requirements of the Zoning By-law. The original tracing of said plan shall be returned to the applicant.

All lots coming before the Planning Board for “Approval Not Required” endorsement must have the feasibility for reasonable driveway access across the legal frontage on the existing or proposed street to the building site, even if other access by a common or single driveway easement is actually to be used. If interior lot access is only feasible by common or outside driveway easement, the lots are in effect landlocked; the driveway, as the sole feasible access is tantamount to a street that should be subject to regulation under Subdivision Control, per M.G.L. Ch. 41, Sec. 81-L (Definitions) and M (Purpose). Determination as to feasibility of access via legal frontage shall be made based on steepness of topography, presence/absence of ledge, and presence/absence of wetland along the proposed driveway route from legal frontage to building site. (See also Hamilton Zoning By-law, Sec. I.B., limiting driveways across wetlands). The applicant shall document compliance with access via legal frontage “requirements” on the plan. If compliance cannot be demonstrated, submission as a Definitive Subdivision Plan under these Subdivision Regulations is an alternative for the applicant.” (Added: 11/84)

If the Board determines that the plan does require approval under the Subdivision Control Law, it shall within twenty-one (21) days of submission of said plan so inform the applicant by written notice and return the original tracing of the plan. The Board shall also notify the Town Clerk in writing of its determination.

The following words will be stamped on each “Approval not Required” plan endorsed under this section:

PLANNING BOARD ENDORSEMENT OF THIS PLAN INDICATES ONLY THAT THE PLAN IS NOT A SUBDIVISION UNDER M.G.L. CH. 41, SEC. 81 L, AND DOES NOT INDICATE THAT THE LOT IS BUILDABLE OR THAT IT MEETS ZONING, HEALTH, CONSERVATION OR GENERAL BY-LAW REQUIREMENTS.

10. Digital Data Requirements (added September 27, 2005)

a. All site or subdivision plans and as-builts and/or specifications must be submitted in digital format to the town.

b. All geographic data must be submitted in a standard real-world coordinate system. The following coordinate system is strongly preferred:

Projection: Datum: Fipszone: Units: Spheroid:

Massachusetts Stateplane Mainland NAD83
2001
Meters
GRS 1980

c. All digital data must be delivered in one of the following formats:

ESRI Shapefile format
ESRI Arc/Info Interchange File format (eOO)
Autodesk AutoCAD dwg format
Autodesk AutoCAD dxf format

d. All data must be clean of undershooting and overshooting arcs (dangles). Polygons must be snapped closed at nodes and lines must snap to one another at nodes.

e. All data must be thematically organized. There must be separate layers for road edges, road centerlines, buildings, streams, water and sewer mains, hydrants, easements, parcels, water bodies, etc. For example, if a stream is coincident with a parcel boundary that coincident line must appear in both the parcel layer and the stream layer. All data shown on the plan shall be submitted digitally.

f. Features which contain a third dimension or elevation data (z value) must have the elevation value within the attribute data. If elevation data is submitted in a CAD format then the value must be part of the feature (polyline).

g. Documentation:

1). A list of all files being submitted is required.

2). CAD data shall include metadata for each layer included within the file. This documentation will provide information on the source of the data, feature type (point, line, polygon, etc), source date, and a general description of what is shown on the layer(s).

3) GIS data submissions (e.g., shp file, eOO export) must include all items from B above as well as metadata for each of the feature’s geographic data attributes. This will include a complete description of each attribute’s definition as well as a description of what each of the attribute values mean for each field.

h. Documentation on the method/s used for data collection shall be submitted for all data deliverables.

i. Documentation on the horizontal and vertical accuracy shall be submitted for all data deliverables.

j. Text & Annotation:

1). For CAD submissions, text must be placed in separate layers. Features must not be erased in order to accommodate the placement of text. Text layers must be thematically separate, meaning that text associated with hydrography should be placed on a single layer, while text pertaining to a parcel’s ID number should be placed on yet another separate layer. For example, should there be text on a map defining a parcel’s ill number and another piece of text defining a stream name, the deliverable to the town must include two (2) separate text layers, one for the parcel ID numbers and one for the stream names.

2). Text associated with a GIS formatted data deliverable must be in one of three forms.

a). A label attribute. This would be related to the feature’s attribute fields as previously described above in Section 7.

b). Annotation subclass. This would be separate annotation included within a feature data set as a series of text attribute tables (TAT).

c). Annotation coverage (eOO export). This would be an entirely separate feature class containing text or annotation only.

k). Pertaining to CAD formatted deliverables, features which cross map sheets must precisely match each other at the join line between the sheets; edge matching must be seamless.

The GIS Technical Agent for the Town shall insure data is properly submitted before permits are issued or plans are endorsed.
All deliverables, data, text and/or documentation must be submitted on either CD-ROM or DVD.

C. These regulations shall be considered as revised to conform with any amendment of Chapter 41 of the General Laws made after adoption of these regulations.

D. Outside Consultants to Assist Planning Board (Section added 6/90)

When reviewing an application for (permit/approval), the Board may determine that the assistance of outside consultants is warranted due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project or because of a project’s potential impacts. The Board may require that applicants pay a “review fee” consisting of the reasonable costs incurred by the Board for the employment of outside consultants engaged by the Board to assist in the review of an application.

In hiring outside consultants, the Board may engage engineers, planners, lawyers, urban designers or other appropriate professionals who can assist the Board in analyzing a project to ensure compliance with all relevant laws, ordinances/bylaws, and regulations.

The Board will estimate the review fee in advance of performance of the consulting work. Funds received by the Board pursuant to this section shall be
deposited with the municipal treasurer who shall establish a special account for this purpose. Expenditures from this special account may be made at the direction of the Board without further appropriation. Expenditures from this special account shall be made only in connection with the review of a specific project or projects for which a review fee has been or will be collected from the applicant. Failure of an applicant to pay a review fee shall be grounds for denial of the (application/permit).

Review fees may only be spent for services rendered in connection with the specific project from which they were collected. Accrued interest may also be spent for this purpose. At the completion of the Board’s review of a project, any excess amount in the account, including interest, attributable to a specified project, shall be repaid to the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest. A final report of said account shall be made available to the applicant or the applicant’s successor in interest. For the purpose of this regulation, any person or entity claiming to be an applicant’s successor in interest shall provide the Board with documentation establishing such succession in interest.

Any applicant may take an administrative appeal from the selection of the outside consultant to the Board of Selectmen. The grounds for such an appeal shall be limited to claims that the consultant selected has a conflict of interest or does not possess the minimum, required qualifications. The minimum qualifications shall consist either of an educational degree in, or related to, the field at issue or three or more years of practice in the field at issue or related field. The required time limit for action upon an application by the board shall be extended by the duration of the administrative appeal. In the event that no decision is made by the Board of Selectmen within one month following the filing of the appeal, the selection made by the board shall stand.
