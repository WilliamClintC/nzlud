PREFACE 
    The Commerce Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1968, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with the 2010 Republication, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of William Camil, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and Beginning with the 2010 Republication, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This Supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 695, passed February 20, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title, chapter, article and division. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with the 2010 Republication, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    Beginning with the 2010 Republication, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with the 2010 Republication, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with the 2010 Republication, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    The page numbering system used in this code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1

The defendant may, prior to the date upon which he promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant shall not appear, either in person or by counsel, the magistrate may declare the bail forfeited, and may, in his discretion, order that no further proceedings shall be had in the case. 
    Upon the making of the order that no further proceedings be had, all sums deposited as bail shall forthwith be paid into the county treasury for distribution pursuant to Section 1463 of the Penal Code.

CHAPTER 2.10 - LIMITATIONS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS IN CITY ELECTIONS 

2.10.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The problem of ever increasing campaign expenditures has become a serious, if not disastrous, reality of American politics, and campaigns in the city are not excepted. Incidental to the high cost of election campaigning is the problem of improper influence, real or potential, exercised by campaign contributors over elected officials. 
    It is the purpose and intent of the city council in enacting this chapter to place realistic and enforceable limits on the amounts individuals may contribute to political campaigns in municipal elections; to insure and promote integrity, honesty, and fairness in the decisions of public policy; to insure that funds and services donated to a candidate or campaign committee are used solely for lawful campaign purposes; to insure a level of discussion of public issues adequate for a viable political campaign and to provide opportunity for all citizens to become candidates for public office unhindered by a need to meet exorbitant costs; and to provide full and fair enforcement of all the provisions of this chapter. 
    In seeking to establish such realistic limitations, it is the intent of the city council to promote a broader and more open participation by all citizens in the electoral process and it is in no way intended that such limitations should act to deprive or restrict any citizen in the exercise of rights guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. 
(Ord. 401 § 1(part), 1987). 
2.10.020 - Definitions. 
    Whenever in this chapter the following words or phrases are used, they shall mean:

(2)  "Committee" means any person or combination of two or more persons acting jointly in behalf of or in opposition to a candidate for municipal office or to the qualification for the ballot or adoption of one or more measures. 
(3)  "Election" means any primary, general or special municipal election held in the city including an initiative, referendum or recall election. 
(4)  "Measure" means any proposition submitted to a popular vote at an election, whether by initiative, referendum or recall procedure or otherwise, or circulated for purposes of submission to a popular vote at any election, whether or not the proposition qualifies for the ballot. 
(5)  "Person" means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, firm, committee, club or other organization or group of persons however organized. 
(Ord. 412 § 1, 1987: Ord. 401 § 1(part), 1987). 
2.10.030 - Supplementation of state law. 
    This chapter is intended to supplement the Political Reform Act of 1974. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, words and phrases used in this chapter, including reporting periods and thresholds, shall have the same meaning as defined in the Political Reform Act of 1974, Title 9 of the Government Code of the state of California, as said Act now exists or may hereafter be amended. 
(Ord. 401 § 1(part), 1987). 
2.10.040 - Campaign contribution limitations. 
(a)  No candidate for elective office and no controlled committee of that candidate may solicit or accept any campaign contribution that will cause the total amount contributed by any one person to the candidate in support of or opposition to a campaign, measure or other expenditure related to a political, legislative or governmental activity to exceed one thousand dollars per calendar year. For purposes of this chapter, contributions from husband and wife are considered separate and distinct contributions and may not exceed one thousand dollars each. However, contributions purported to be from minor children under eighteen years of age shall be considered one in the same as those made by their respective parent(s) and/or guardian(s). 
(b)  Loans for use in connection with an election for a period of more than thirty days are prohibited. Loans of more than one thousand dollars for use in connection with an election are prohibited. Loans to a candidate or his or her controlled committees shall be counted against the contribution limitations applicable to that candidate. Provided, however, a candidate is not prohibited from obtaining a personal loan of any amount from a duly licensed financial lending institution in the regular course of business or loaning his or her personal funds in any amount to his or her own campaign or controlled committee. 
(c)  Any contributions solicited or accepted pursuant to this section shall be expended only in connection with the candidacy for the office specified in the candidate's declaration of intent to solicit and receive contributions, or the measure for which it is solicited, unless otherwise permitted by applicable state laws or regulations.

CHAPTER 3.10 - HOTEL VISITOR TAX 

3.10.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Uniform Hotel Visitor Tax Ordinance of the City of Commerce." 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.020 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter, as follows: 
(1)  "Guest," "transient" and/or "visitor" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a guest, transient and/or visitor until the period of thirty days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a guest, transient and/or visitor, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(2)  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by guests, transients and/or visitors for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, bed and breakfast, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, boarding house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
(3)  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
(4)  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
(5)  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or other group or combination acting as a unit. 
(6)  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
(7)  "Tax administrator" means the finance director of the city or his or her designee. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.030 - Imposition-Amount-Where payable. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each guest, transient and/or visitor is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator or at any lesser rate that the city council shall determine by resolution. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the guest, transient and/or visitor to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The guest, transient and/or visitor shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the guest, transient and/or visitor's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.040 - Exemptions. 
    No tax shall be imposed upon: 
(1)  Any federal officer or employee when on official business; 
(2)  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
    No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.050 - Guest, transient and/or visitor occupancy registration certificate requirements. 
    Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to guests, transients and/or visitors shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him or her a guest, transient and/or visitor occupancy registration certificate, which shall be referred to as the "visitor occupancy registration certificate," to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(1)  The name of the operator; 
(2)  The address of the hotel; 
(3)  The date upon which the certificate was issued; and 
(4)  The following statement: 
This visitor occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform hotel visitor tax ordinance of the city of Commerce by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from guests, transients and/or visitors the hotel guest, transient and/or visitor tax and remitting such tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. It is unlawful to operate a hotel in the city without a currently valid certificate. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.060 - Collection. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every guest, transient and/or visitor. If the operator collects the rent but fails to collect the tax imposed by this chapter, for any reason, the operator shall nevertheless be required to pay such tax to the city. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each guest, transient and/or visitor shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. A duplicate of this receipt shall be kept by the operator in accordance with Section 3.10.080. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for guest, transient and/or visitor occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted by the operator to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.080 - Recordkeeping. 
    It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.090 - Failure of operator to collect and report tax-Determination of tax by tax administrator-Notice and hearing. 
    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of business address. Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause, at a time and place fixed in the notice, why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable fifteen days after the date of the tax administrator's written notice unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.10.100. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.100 - Appeals. 
    Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give five days' notice in writing thereof to such operator at his or her last known place of business address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive, and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner previously prescribed for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.110 - Penalties and interest. 
(a)  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any portion of any tax imposed by this chapter, within the time required, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
(b)  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
(c)  Audit Deficiency. If, upon audit by the city, an operator is found to be deficient in his or her return or his or her remittance, or both, the tax administrator shall immediately invoice the operator for the amount of the net deficiency plus a penalty of ten percent of the net deficiency. If the operator fails or refuses to pay the deficient amount and applicable penalties within fourteen days of the date of the invoice, an additional penalty shall be imposed at the rate of one percent per day of the net deficiency, not to exceed ten percent of the total of the deficiency amount and penalties. 
(d)  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(e)  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(f)  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.120 - Duty of successor or operator. 
    If an operator who is liable for any tax or penalties under this chapter sells or otherwise disposes of his or her hotel, his or her successor shall notify the tax administrator of the date of sale and withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to equal the amount of such tax or penalty, for payment to city, until the selling operator produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that the tax or penalty has been paid or a tax clearance certificate from the tax administrator stating that no tax or penalty is due. If the seller does not present a receipt or tax clearance certificate within thirty days after such successor commences to conduct business, the successor shall deposit the withheld amount with the tax administrator pending settlement of the account of the seller. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.130 - Liability of successor for failure to withhold-Notice of amount due. 
    If the successor to the hotel fails to withhold a portion of the purchase price as required, he or she shall also, along with the seller, be liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld, and any penalty. Within thirty days after receiving a written request from the successor for a tax clearance certificate, stating that no tax or penalty is due, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the successor at his or her address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the estimated amount of the tax and penalty that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005).

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
(b)  An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a guest, transient and/or visitor; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the guest, transient and/or visitor or credited to the rent subsequently payable by the guest, transient and/or visitor to the operator. 
(c)  A guest, transient and/or visitor may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the guest, transient and/or visitor directly to the tax administrator, or when the guest, transient and/or visitor, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the guest, transient and/or visitor has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax and that the operator has already paid the amount of the subject tax to the city.

Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.

The tax administrator shall give the operator written notice of the suspension or revocation of his or her certificate. The notice required in this section may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination. The tax administrator shall not issue a new certificate after a revocation unless he or she is satisfied that the former holder of the certificate will comply with the provisions of this chapter and regulations of the tax administrator.

From the time of the filing for record, the amount required to be remitted, together with interest and penalties, constitutes a lien upon all real property in the county owned by the operator or afterwards and before the lien expires acquired by him or her. The lien has the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien and shall continue for ten years from the time of filing of the notice of lien unless sooner released or otherwise discharged.

(4)  Whenever the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person required to pay any amount under this chapter are levied upon by process law. This chapter does not give the city a preference over any recorded lien which attached prior to the date when the amounts required to be paid became a lien. 
(b)  The preference given to the city by this section shall be subordinate to the preferences given to claims for personal services by Sections 1204 through 1208.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
(Ord. 591 §1(part), 2005). 
3.10.210 - Warrant for collection of tax.

After receiving the withholding notice, the person so notified shall make no disposition of the taxpayer's credits, other personal property or debts until the city consents to a transfer or disposition or until sixty days elapse after the receipt of the notice, whichever expires earlier. All persons, upon receipt of such notice, shall advise the city immediately of all such credits, other personal property or debts in their possession, under their control or owing by them.

CHAPTER 5.09 - MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS AND MASSAGE TECHNICIANS*[] 

Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
*  Prior ordinance history: Ordinance 173, 174, 344 and 389. 

5.09.100 - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(b)  The city is authorized, by virtue of the State Constitution, Section 16000 of the Business and Professions Code, and Sections 51030 et seq. of the Government Code, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards relative to the skill and experience of massage operators and reasonable conditions on the operation of massage establishments. 
(c)  The state legislature enacted Business and Professions Code Section 4600 et seq., which establishes uniform standards of certification and regulation of massage practitioners and massage therapists that are binding on all cities throughout the state. 
(d)  There is significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly trained and/or educated massage technicians and this chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss. 
(e)  There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments are often brothels in disguise. The establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity. 
(f)  The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter reduce the burdens on the sheriff's department and permit the deployment of police personnel such that more serious crimes may be prevented and more important laws enforced. 
(g)  The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter tend to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved.

(g)  In determining whether to grant, deny or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer of a franchise, grantor's consideration may include, but is not necessarily limited to: 
(1)  The legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; 
(2)  Any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; 
(3)  Whether the incumbent grantee is in compliance with its franchise and applicable law and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; 
(4)  Whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the service area and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of the cable service in the service area; and 
(5)  Whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public or grantor's interest in the cable franchise or applicable law. 
(h)  Any transfer without grantor's prior written approval is ineffective, and will make a franchise subject to revocation and to any other remedies available under the franchise or applicable law, except where a request for approval or sale is subject to a deadline for action under 47 U.S.C. Section 537 and grantor fails to act by the time required under 47 U.S.C. Section 537. 
(i)  Grantor will not approve a transfer request unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of the cable franchise grant and applicable law and that the transferee will assume the obligations, liabilities and responsibility for all acts and omissions of the previous grantee under the franchise grant and applicable law for all purposes, including renewal, unless grantor, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole or in part. 
(j)  Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, such financial institution shall also agree in writing to continue cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. 
(k)  Any submission of an application for transfer of a franchise shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable franchise processing fee in the amount of three thousand dollars. Upon transfer, grantee shall reimburse grantor for grantor's reasonable processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses.

(Ord. 570 §1(part), 2003). 
5.44.060 - Nonexclusive franchise. 
    Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable system, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable law. 
(Ord. 570 §1(part), 2003). 
5.44.065 - Multiple franchises. 
(a)  Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
(1)  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage; 
(2)  The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service; or 
(3)  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way. 
(b)  Grantor may require that any new entrant, non-incumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in grantor's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. 
(Ord. 570 §1(part), 2003). 
5.44.070 - Franchise modification. 
    The grantee may be required to pay any reasonable costs incurred by the grantor in processing a grantee request for franchise modification.

CHAPTER 6.07 - MOBILE SOURCE AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION 

6.07.010 - Findings. 
    The city hereby finds and declares that: 
(1)  Whereas, the city is committed to improving the public health, safety and welfare, including air quality; 
(2)  Whereas, mobile sources are a major contributor to air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin; 
(3)  Whereas, air quality goals for the region established by state law cannot be met without reducing air pollution from mobile sources; 
(4)  Whereas, the South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) calls upon cities and counties to reduce emissions from motor vehicles consistent with the requirements of the California Clean Air Act of 1988 by developing and implementing mobile source air pollution reduction programs; 
(5)  Whereas, such programs place demands upon the city's funds, those programs should be financed by shifting the responsibility for financing from the general fund to the motor vehicles creating the demand, to the greatest extent possible; 
(6)  Whereas, Section 44223, added to the Health and Safety Code by action of the California Legislature on September 30, 1990 (Chapter 90-1705), authorizes the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) to impose an additional motor vehicle registration fee of two dollars, commencing on April 1, 1991, increasing to four dollars, commencing on April 1, 1992, to finance the implementation of transportation measures embodied in the AQMP and provisions of the California Clean Air Act; 
(7)  Whereas, forty cents of every dollar under Section 44223 of the Health and Safety Code shall be distributed to cities and counties located in the South Coast Air Quality Management District that comply with Section 44243 of the code, based on the jurisdictions' prorated share of population as defined by the State Department of Finance; 
(8)  Whereas, the city is located within the South Coast Air Quality Management District and is eligible to receive a portion of the revenues from the additional motor vehicle registration fees contingent upon adoption of this chapter; 
(9)  Whereas, the prorated share of the fee revenues for cities that fail to adopt an ordinance pursuant to Section 44243(b)(3) of the Health and Safety Code shall be distributed instead to the jurisdictions within the district that have adopted an ordinance; 
(10)  Now, therefore be it resolved that, the city, after careful consideration, hereby finds and declares that the imposition of the additional motor vehicle registration fee by the SCAQMD to finance mobile source air pollution reduction programs is in the best interest of the city and promotes the general welfare of its residents. 
(Ord. 448 § 1(part), 1991).

CHAPTER 6.13 - REQUIREMENTS FOR AREAS FOR COLLECTING AND LOADING RECYCLABLE MATERIALS IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 

6.13.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  Cities and counties must divert fifty percent of all solid waste by January 1, 2000, through source reduction, recycling and composting activities. 
(b)  Diverting fifty percent of all solid waste requires the participation of the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors. 
(c)  The lack of adequate areas for collecting and loading recyclable materials that are compatible with surrounding land uses is a significant impediment to diverting solid waste and constitutes an urgent need for state and local reduction, recycling and composting activities. This chapter has been developed to meet that need. 
(Ord. 492 § 1(part), 1994). 
6.13.020 - Definitions.

(2)  Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded and any improvements for any areas of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste; 
(3)  The definition of development project only includes subdivisions or tracts of single-family detached homes if, within such subidivisions of tracts, there is an area where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location which serves five or more living units. In such instances, reycling areas as specified in this chapter are only required to serve the needs of the living units which utilize the solid waste collection and loading area. 
(b)  Improvement. An improvement adds to the value of a facility, prolongs its useful life or adapts it to new uses. Improvements should be distinguished from repairs. Repairs keep facilities in good operating condition, do not materially add to the value of the facility, and do not substantially extend the life of the facility. 
(c)  Public Facility. The definition of public facility includes, but is not limited to buildings, structures and outdoor recreation areas owned by local agency. 
(d)  Recycling Area (Areas for Recycling). Space allocated for collecting and loading of recyclable materials. Such areas shall have the ability to accomodate receptacles for recyclable materials.

CHAPTER 9.05 - BURGLAR AND ROBBERY ALARMS 

9.05.010 - Findings. 
    The city council finds: 
(a)  Many burglar and robbery alarms to which law enforcement responds are false. Such false alarms result in an enormous waste of manpower; 
(b)  Alarm systems which automatically and directly dial any emergency phone number are very prone to be activated by current failures or other events having no connection with criminal activity and tie up such emergency phones making them unavailable to receive genuine emergency calls; 
(c)  The danger to citizens through emergency response created by false alarms must be eliminated; 
(d)  The unnecessary waste of tax dollars through responses to false alarms must be elimated; and 
(e)  False burglar and robbery alarms have created conditions causing danger and annoyance to the general public. 
(Ord. 559 § 1, 2002).

(e)  "False alarm" means an alarm signal activated by causes other than the commission or attempted commission of an un-lawful act which the alarm system is designated to detect and/or report; and which results in a requested and/or actual response by law enforcement. False alarms include, but are not limited to, the activation of an alarm system because of mechanical failure, preventable accident, improper operation, misuse, malfunction, improper installation, or negligence or carelessness of the alarm user. An alarm signal activated by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances not subject to the control of the alarm owner shall not constitute a false alarm. 
(Ord. 559 § 1, 2002). 
9.05.030 - Audible alarm-Identification of owner operation.

(Ord. 559 § 1, 2002). 
9.05.100 - Violation-Corrective action. 
    Violation of this chapter shall be prosecuted as an infraction. Upon the first and second false alarm in a calendar year beginning January 1st, the sheriff will fill out a form (in triplicate) one to the alarm owner, one to the city, and one to remain on file with the sheriff's department indicating the property location, date of false alarm, and other information necessary to track false alarms.

CHAPTER 9.09 - RESIDENT ACTIVITY CARD REQUIREMENTS; PENALTIES FOR FRAUDULENTLY OBTAINED CARDS 

9.09.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council finds that, at times, the city resident activity cards have been obtained based on fraudulent representations to the city's parks and recreation department staff. The resident activity cards are intended to benefit the city's residents and provide access to a number of programs that are paid for, in whole or in part, by the city. The use of fraud by individuals that are not qualified to obtain the resident activity cards prevents other qualified individuals from participating in certain city programs and undermines the purpose of the resident activity card program. The city council finds that it is in the best interests of the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the city, as well as in fairness to its citizens, that the city specifically identify the qualifications for the issuance of the resident activity cards and impose penalties on those persons that are found to have fraudulently obtained a resident activity card or who have assisted another person in fraudulently obtaining a resident activity card.

CHAPTER 9.14 - ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR CODE SECTION 6404.5 SMOKING PROHIBITIONS 

9.14.010 - Intent. 
    The prohibitions of Labor Code § 6404.5(b) shall be liberally construed in order to protect the health and safety of employees. Any proposed or existing smoking area should take all reasonable precautions to maximize openings and ventilation within the space. The lack of a definition of an "enclosed space" may present difficult issues for a local law enforcement agency that is responsible for the enforcement of Labor Code § 6404.5. Such determinations may be impacted by current law and authorities, building codes, architectural and other technological advancements. The determination of whether a space is an "enclosed space," therefore, may not always be easily made by the local law enforcement agency. The director of public works and development services ("director") addresses building code issues on a daily basis and is technically capable of making such determinations. It is not, however, within the director's purview to determine what constitutes a "place of employment" under Labor Code § 6404.5. Labor Code § 6404.5(j) requires the city council to designate the local law enforcement agency that shall enforce the prohibitions of § 6404.5. The city council desires to designate the local law enforcement agency and provide a process by which the technical determinations required by § 6404.5 can be determined in connection with enforcement authority. 
(Ord. No. 663, § 1, 10-7-2014) 
9.14.020 - Designation of local law enforcement agency. 
    Pursuant to Labor Code § 6404.5(j), the city council hereby designates the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health as the local law enforcement agency that shall be responsible for the enforcement of Labor Code § 6404.5. The County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health shall make determinations regarding the definition of an "enclosed space" in conjunction with the city's director of public works and development services as set forth herein. 
(Ord. No. 663, § 1, 10-7-2014) 
9.14.030 - Penalty. 
    Pursuant to Labor Code § 6404.5(j), any violation of the prohibition set forth in Labor Code § 6404.5(b) is an infraction, punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars for a first violation, two hundred dollars for a second violation within one year, and five hundred dollars for a third and for each subsequent violation within one year. The local law enforcement agency designated herein shall comply with these Labor Code provisions as currently written, or as they may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 663, § 1, 10-7-2014) 
9.14.040 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  "CAL OSHA" means California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
(2)  "Director" means the city's director of public works and development services. 
(3)  "Place of employment" is defined by Labor Code § 6404.5(d). Whether a space constitutes a "place of employment" will be determined by the local enfocement agency based on the definition within Labor Code § 6404.5(d). 
(4)  "Space" means the space that is used as, or that the applicant is seeking to use as an area where smoking tobacco is permitted. 
(5)  "Structure" is defined as the way that something is built, arranged, or organized. 
(6)  "Wall" is defined as (1) a structure of brick, stone, etc., that surrounds an area or separates one area from another and (2) the structure that forms the side of a room or building, among other less applicable definitions. 
(7)  "Ceiling" is defined as the inside surface or lining at the top of a room. 
(8)  "Roof" is defined as "the structure forming the upper covering of a building." 
(9)  "Border" is defined as the outer limits of the existing or proposed space, regardless of whether a structure is in place along said border. 
(Ord. No. 663, § 1, 10-7-2014) 
9.14.050 - Determinations regarding "enclosed structure." 
    The director shall, when requested by the owner of a structure or by the local law enforcement agency, inspect plans of an existing structure or the plans for a renovated or new structure and issue a written determination as to whether any part of the area constitutes an "enclosed space" pursuant to Labor Code § 6404.5(b). The director's determination may be requested as part of an enforcement proceeding or in connection with the building or renovation of a structure that is being proposed as a place where smoking is to be allowed. 
    The director shall utilize the following procedure when making such a determination: 
(1)  Does any portion of the border surrounding the space not have a wall? 
(2)  If any portion of the border surrounding the space does not have a wall, what percentage of the circumference of the surrounding area does not have a wall? (While there is no percentage requirement, CAL OSHA has advised cities in the past that "enclosure" is "generally understood to mean a space surrounded by four walls, a floor and a ceiling." CAL OSHA has also stated that, on that basis, "bars, taverns or gaming clubs with patio areas which lack a roof or walls would not be an 'enclosed space.'" Likewise, the attorney general has opined that "walls and roof make it an 'enclosed space' as that term is normally understood." However, any opening is not enough, as the code is liberally construed to reduce employee exposure to tobacco smoke. These authorities could be interpreted to mean that a room that is missing a complete wall will not be considered an "enclosed space.") 
(3)  If any portion of the border surrounding the space does not have a wall, is that portion directly exposed to outside air with no physical structure separating the space from the outside space? 
(4)  Is the space "separated from the surrounding ground" outside? (This determination is based on Attorney General Opinion No. 97-1201 wherein the attorney general opined that "A bar, restaurant, or tavern with walls and a roof is separated from surrounding ground when the doors and windows are open.") 
(5)  If it is questionable whether there is a wall or separation from the surrounding ground, does the separation in place allow for ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no wall was in place? (This element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a wall allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no wall was in place.) 
(6)  Is there a ceiling covering the space? 
(7)  If the space has a ceiling, does the ceiling permit ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no ceiling was in place? (This element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a ceiling allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no ceiling was in place.) 
(8)  Is there a roof covering the space? 
(9)  If the space has a roof, does the roof permit for ventilation equivalent to a scenario where no roof was in place? (This element would be satisfied if the structure in place of a roof allows for circulation of outside air equivalent to a scenario where no roof was in place.) 
(10)  Does the design of the space or the plans submitted by the applicant take significant steps to reduce employee exposure to environmental tobacco smoke? (This includes additional steps to increase ventilation in the space beyond ordinary openings to the outside space, including mechanical ventilation and/or a combination of openings in the ceiling and/or walls/separations.) 
(11)  Is the space a "structural part of the building" pursuant to Labor Code § 6404.5(b)? (Labor Code § 6404.5(b) states that "'Enclosed space' includes lobbies, lounges, waiting areas, elevators, stairwells, and restrooms that are a structural part of the building and not specifically defined in subdivision (d).") 
(12)  Can it be said that the space is an "enclosed space" pursuant to Labor Code § 6404.5? (The attorney general has opined that "Although the phrase 'enclosed space' has some inherent vagueness, it gives fair warning of the statute's application. Based on the above factors, is the space an enclosed space?") 
(Ord. No. 663, § 1, 10-7-2014) 
9.14.060 - Appeal. 
(a)  All actions and decisions of the director authorized by this chapter may be appealed to the city administrator. All such appeals shall be filed in writing with the city clerk. All appeals must be filed within fourteen calendar days of the date of the rendering of the decision. If the fourteenth day occurs on a holiday or weekend, the appeal period shall be extended to the next city work day. No appeal shall be accepted after the appeal period has expired. 
(b)  All appeals must be submitted in writing on a form to be provided by the city. The appeal must specifically state the grounds for the appeal and instances in which the director erred in reaching the determination. An appeal fee shall be paid concurrent with filing of the appeal in accordance with the fee schedule established by resolution of the city council. 
(c)  Within fourteen days upon receipt of an appeal, the city clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the city administrator. The appealing party and all other interested parties of record will be provided with notice of the hearing.

9.32.020 - Findings, purpose, and intent. 
(a)  The city council finds and declares as follows: 
(1)  Section VII of Article XI of the California Constitution provides that a city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws. 
(2)  California Government Code Section 38771 provides that legislative bodies of cities may declare what constitutes a nuisance. 
(3)  California Government Code Section 38772 et seq., further provides that legislative bodies of cities may also provide for the summary abatement of any nuisance at the expense of the persons creating, causing, committing, or maintaining it, and by ordinance may make the expense of abatement of nuisances a lien against the property on which the nuisance is maintained and a personal obligation against the property owner. 
(4)  Nuisance conditions are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and community appearance, an obstruction to or interference with the comfortable enjoyment of adjacent property or premises (both public and private), and/or are hazardous or injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public. 
(b)  The city council hereby declares that the purpose and intent of this chapter are as follows: 
(1)  To define as public nuisances and violations of those conditions and uses of land that are offensive or annoying to the senses, detrimental to property values and/or community appearance, an obstruction to or interference with the comfortable enjoyment of adjacent property or premises, and/or hazardous or injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the general public. 
(2)  To develop regulations that will promote the sound maintenance of property and enhance conditions of appearance, habitability, occupancy, use and safety of all structures and premises in the city. 
(3)  To establish administrative procedures for the city's use, upon its election, to correct or abate violations of this chapter on real property throughout the city. 
    This chapter is not intended to be applied, construed, or given effect in a manner that imposes upon the city, or upon any officer or employee thereof, any duty towards persons or property within the city or outside of the city that creates a basis for civil liability for damages, except as otherwise imposed by law.

(c)  The provisions of this section shall not apply if demolition is required to address an imminent hazard. In such situation, the provisions of Section 9.32.170 shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.090 - Service of notice.

Failure of any responsible person to receive a notice by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Except as otherwise expressly required by a provision of this chapter, any notice issued to an owner of real property shall be sent to the mailing address on the last equalized assessment roll.

(c)  The provisions of this chapter only apply to instances where the city has elected to establish the right, but not the obligation, to abate public nuisances with city personnel. In no event does this chapter limit the right of city officials to issue alternative written or oral notices of code violations to responsible persons or to cause the abatement of public nuisances in a different manner, including without limitation, by court orders arising from the city's exercise of its criminal or civil remedies. In such instances, a responsible person shall receive a right to hearing and other due process rights through the court process. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009)

    A notice of abatement shall be deemed in substantial compliance with this section regardless of form if all substantive information is contained in such notice of abatement. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.120 - Consequences for an untimely appeal. 
(a)  If a timely appeal is not received by the city clerk, the right to appeal is waived and the notice of abatement is final and binding. In such instances, the city may, without any administrative hearing, cause the abatement with city forces of any or all of the nuisance conditions or activities stated in the notice of abatement. Entry onto private real property that is both improved and occupied shall, excepting instances of an imminent hazard, be with an abatement warrant from the superior court. The city shall follow the procedures stated in this chapter for recovery of all abatement costs, fees and expenses (incidental or otherwise). 
(b)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall obligate the city to undertake abatement actions pursuant to a notice of abatement, whether or not there is a timely appeal. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.130 - Abatement by responsible person prior to hearing. 
(a)  Any responsible person shall have the right to abate a nuisance in accordance with the notice of abatement at his or her own expense, provided all corrective actions are completed with all required city permits, approvals and inspections, prior to the date the matter is set for a hearing. 
(b)  A hearing shall be cancelled if all nuisance conditions or activities are, as determined by the city, fully and lawfully abated prior thereto. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.140 - Review by hearing officer. 
(a)  Any responsible person who contests a notice of abatement shall, subject to filing a timely appeal, obtain review thereof before a hearing officer. The administrative appeal shall be scheduled no later than sixty calendar days, and no sooner than ten calendar days, after receipt of a timely filed request for appeal. The appellants listed on the written request for an appeal shall be notified in writing at least ten calendar days prior to the date of the hearing by first class mail of the date, time, and location of the hearing. 
(b)  Any request by an appellant to continue a hearing must be submitted to the city clerk in writing no later than two business days before the date scheduled for the hearing. The hearing officer may continue a hearing for good cause, however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more than thirty calendar days without stipulation by all parties. 
(c)  At the place and time set forth in the notification of appeal hearing, the hearing officer shall hear the testimony of the appealing person(s), the issuing officer, and/or their witnesses, as well as any documentary evidence presented by these persons concerning the alleged public nuisance(s). 
(d)  Appeal hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a nuisance exists by a preponderance of evidence. The issuance of a notice of abatement shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation and the code enforcement officer who issued the notice of abatement is not required to participate in the appeal hearing. The appellant, and the enforcement officer issuing the notice, as well as all other interested persons, shall have the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. The appellant, or other interested persons, may represent himself/herself/themselves or be represented by anyone of his/her/their choice. The appellant, or other interested persons, may bring an interpreter to the hearing at his/her/their sole expense. 
(e)  If the appellant fails, or other interested persons fail, to appear, or to otherwise submit any admissible evidence demonstrating the nonexistence of the alleged nuisance condition(s), the hearing officer shall cancel the hearing and send a notice thereof to the responsible person(s) by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the appeal form. A cancellation of a hearing due to nonappearance of the appellant shall constitute the appellant's waiver of the right to appeal. In such instances, the notice of abatement is final and binding. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.150 - Decision of hearing officer-Order of abatement. 
(a)  Within a reasonable time, not to exceed fifteen calendar days following conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine if any nuisance condition exists at the subject property. If the hearing officer determines that each nuisance condition described in the notice of abatement is nonexistent, the notice of abatement shall be deemed canceled. If the hearing officer determines that one or more of the nuisance conditions described in the notice of abatement exists, he/she shall issue a written order of abatement which shall contain the following: 
(1)  A finding and description of each nuisance condition existing at the subject property; 
(2)  The name of each person responsible for a nuisance condition, or conditions, at the subject property, as well as the name of any appellant who lacks responsibility therefore; 
(3)  The required corrective action and completion date for each unabated nuisance condition; 
(4)  Any other finding, determination or requirement that is relevant or related to the subject matter of the appeal. 
(b)  The decision of the hearing officer is final and conclusive. The order of abatement shall also contain the following statement: "The Hearing Officer's decision is final, and judicial review of this decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 et seq." 
(c)  A copy of the order of abatement shall be served by first class mail on each responsible person to whom the notice of abatement was issued. If the owner is not an appellant, a copy of the order of abatement shall also be served on the owner by first class mail to the address shown on the last equalized assessment roll. Failure of a responsible person to receive a properly addressed order of abatement shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  The failure of any appellant to comply with an order of abatement by completing each of the requisite corrective actions in the manner and time set forth in the order of abatement constitutes a misdemeanor offense punishable in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.160 - Abatement of nuisance by responsible persons prior to city abatement actions. 
(a)  Any responsible person shall have the right to fully abate a nuisance in accordance with an order of abatement prior to the date of entry by city forces or agents upon the subject real property, provided that all corrective actions are completed in the manner and time set forth in the order of abatement. In such instances, all administrative proceedings shall be cancelled. 
(b)  Once the city enters a subject real property to abate a public nuisance, it shall have the right to complete this action. 
(c)  It is unlawful and a misdemeanor to obstruct, impede, or interfere with city personnel in the performance of any act that is carried out to abate a public nuisance. 
(d)  All personal property that is removed by city personnel from premises in the abatement of a nuisance shall be lawfully disposed of or destroyed without regard to its actual or salvage value. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.170 - Emergency action to abate an imminent hazard. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Commerce Municipal Code to the contrary, the city administrator may cause a public nuisance to be summarily abated if it is determined that the nuisance creates an imminent hazard to a person or persons, or to other real or personal property. 
(b)  Prior to abating a nuisance which creates an imminent hazard, the city administrator shall attempt to notify a responsible person by telephone or in writing of the imminent hazard and request its abatement by said person, provided, however, that the city administrator may dispense with any attempt at prior notification of a responsible person if, in the sole discretion of the city administrator, the nature or severity of the hazard justifies such inaction. If notice has been so given but, in the sole discretion of the city administrator, the responsible person(s) fail(s) to take immediate and meaningful steps to abate the imminent hazard, the city may abate the nuisance with city personnel without further notice. 
(c)  Within ten business days following emergency actions by city personnel to abate an imminent hazard, the city shall serve any responsible person with a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard by first class mail. Notice to a property owner shall be mailed to the mailing address set forth in the last equalized assessment roll. Failure of any responsible person to receive a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard by mail shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(d)  A notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard shall contain the following provisions: 
(1)  The name of all responsible persons who are being served with the notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard and the address of the real property on which the imminent hazard was present; 
(2)  A brief description of the condition(s) and reason(s) why it constituted an imminent hazard; 
(3)  A brief description of the law prohibiting or pertaining to the imminent hazard; 
(4)  A brief description of the actions city personnel took to abate the imminent hazard. 
(e)  Omission of any of the foregoing provisions in a notice of emergency abatement by city personnel of an imminent hazard, whether in whole or in part, or the failure of a responsible person to receive this document, shall not render it defective or render any proceeding or action pursuant to this chapter invalid. 
(f)  Emergency abatement of an imminent hazard by city personnel shall not preclude the city from recording a notice of substandard property in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.32.230 of this chapter, if conditions thereafter remain at the premises that constitute a violation of law or a public nuisance. 
(g)  The city shall be entitled to recover its fees, costs, and expenses (incidental or otherwise) for the abatement of an imminent hazard. In such instances, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009)

(d)  A responsible person has the right to contest a statement of abatement costs by filing a written request for contest with the city clerk's office (located at 2535 Commerce Way, Commerce, California 90040) within ten calendar days of service of the statement of abatement costs. 
(1)  A written request for contest shall contain the following information: 
(A)  Name, address, telephone number, and signature of each responsible party who is contesting the statement of abatement costs; 
(B)  Address and description of real property upon which the city abated a public nuisance; 
(C)  Date of the statement of abatement costs being appealed; 
(D)  Description of the specific abatement cost being contested, and a statement of the grounds for contest in sufficient detail to enable the city council to understand the nature of the controversy. 
(2)  No fee shall be due for the filing of a request for contest. 
(e)  Failure of the city clerk to receive a timely request for contest constitutes a waiver of the right to contest a statement of abatement costs. In this event, the statement of abatement costs is final and binding. And the city may proceed to collect its abatement costs as contained in a final statement of abatement costs in any manner allowed by law. 
(f)  If a timely request for contest is received by the city clerk, a hearing shall be set before the city council no later than sixty calendar days, and no sooner than ten calendar days, of receipt. A notice of the date, time and location of the hearing shall be served on all responsible parties who contested the statement of abatement costs by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the request form at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing.

The city council may continue a hearing for good cause, however, in no event may the hearing be continued for more than forty-five calendar days without stipulation by all parties. 
(h)  At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the request to contest the statement of abatement costs, the city council shall hear and pass upon the evidence submitted by city personnel, together with any objections or protests raised by responsible persons liable for said costs. Thereupon, the city council may make such revision, correction or modification to the statement as it may deem just, after which the statement, as it is submitted, or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed. The hearing may be continued from time to time for good cause. 
(i)  The decision of the city council is final. 
(j)  The city clerk shall cause a confirmed statement of abatement costs to be served upon all persons who contested the original statement by first class mail to the address(es) stated on the request form. This document shall also contain the following statement: "Judicial review of the city council's decision is subject to the provisions and time limits set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.5 et seq." 
(k)  Failure of a person who contested the statement of abatement costs, or any other responsible person, to receive a properly addressed confirmed statement shall not invalidate any action or proceeding by the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(l)  A responsible person shall tender the abatement costs in U.S. currency to the city within thirty calendar days of the date of service of the confirmed statement of abatement costs. The city may thereafter proceed to collect its abatement costs as contained in the confirmed statement of abatement costs in any manner allowed by law.

    The property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrance for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
(c)  The city attorney shall establish the notice of special assessment form for use or consideration by the tax collector in collecting a special assessment. 
(d)  The notice of special assessment shall be entitled to recordation with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. 
(e)  The amount of a special assessment shall also constitute a personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was abated. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.210 - Collection of costs of abatement by nuisance abatement lien. 
(a)  As an alternative to the procedure contained in Section 9.32.200 of this chapter, the city may cause a nuisance abatement lien to be recorded upon real property upon which a public nuisance was abated pursuant to California Government Code Section 38773.1 in the event a statement of abatement costs or a confirmed statement of abatement costs is not paid in a timely manner. 
(b)  A lien shall not be recorded prior to serving the owner of record of the parcel of land on which the public nuisance existed, with a notice. This document shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Article 3 (commencing with Section 415.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in Los Angeles County pursuant to Section 6062 of the Government Code. 
(c)  The nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Los Angeles County Recorder's office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.

(g)  The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. 
(h)  The amount of a nuisance abatement lien shall also constitute a personal obligation of the property owners of land upon which the nuisance was abated. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009)

    Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two year period finding that an owner of property is responsible for a public nuisance, except for public nuisance conditions abated pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 17980, the court may order that person to pay treble the costs of the abatement. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.230 - Recordation of substandard notice. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Commerce Municipal Code to the contrary, if the city determines that any property, building or structure, or any part thereof, is in violation of any provision of the Commerce Municipal Code and said violation has not been fully abated or corrected, as determined by the city, in the manner and time provided in a written notice to a responsible person, then the city, in its sole discretion, may record a notice of substandard property with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office against said premises. As used herein, "fully abated or corrected" includes the procurement of all required city approvals, permits, licenses and the passage of all city required inspections. 
(b)  The city may record a notice of substandard property without the issuance of a notice of abatement pursuant to Section 9.32.070 of this chapter, provided that a written notice of violation or a written notice of correction to a responsible person previously disclosed that a substandard notice may be recorded against a property if a violation is not fully abated or corrected in the manner and time delineated in said notice. 
(c)  A notice of substandard property may be recorded after service of a notice of abatement provided that: 1) the notice of abatement contained this disclosure; 2) the public nuisance was not fully abated or corrected in the manner and time specified in the notice of abatement; and 3) a timely and proper appeal to the notice of abatement was not made. 
(d)  A notice of substandard property may be recorded after service of an order of abatement provided that 1) the order of abatement contained this disclosure, and 2) the public nuisance was not fully abated or corrected in the manner and time specified in the order of abatement. 
(e)  The city attorney or the city prosecutor shall approve the form that constitutes a notice of substandard property. 
(f)  The city shall record a notice of rescission of substandard property with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office within ten business days of its determination that a violation or a public nuisance has been fully abated or corrected. 
(g)  The city shall cause copies of recorded notices of substandard property and notices of rescission of substandard property to be served on all persons having an ownership interest in the subject real property as shown in the last equalized assessment roll. Service thereof shall be by first class mail. Failure of any person to receive such notices shall not invalidate any action or proceeding pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.240 - Code enforcement fees. 
(a)  Pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 17951, responsible persons who cause, allow or maintain a violation in, or upon, residential properties, shall be charged code enforcement fees by the city to defray its costs of code enforcement actions. Such fees shall not exceed the amount reasonably required to achieve this objective and are chargeable whether the city's code enforcement actions occur in the absence of formal administrative or judicial proceedings, as well as prior to, during, or subsequent to, the initiation of such proceedings. 
(b)  The amount(s) or rate(s) of code enforcement fees for city personnel time and other resources that are used for code enforcement actions shall be established by resolution of the city council. 
(c)  The city administrator, or a designee thereof, is authorized to adopt regulations for the uniform imposition of code enforcement fees, and for related administrative actions pertaining to such fees. 
(d)  The fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other fees or charges that responsible persons may owe in accordance with any other provision of this code, or which are imposed pursuant to county, state or federal laws or regulations. 
(e)  Code enforcement fees shall be recoverable in conjunction with any civil, administrative or criminal action to abate, cause the abatement or cessation of, or otherwise remove a violation or a public nuisance. 
(f)  Failure to pay code enforcement fees shall constitute a debt that is collectible in any manner allowed by law. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.250 - Recovery of attorneys fees. 
(a)  A prevailing party in any administrative, civil or equitable judicial action to abate, or cause the abatement or cessation of a public nuisance as defined in this chapter, or in any appeal or other judicial action arising therefrom, may recover reasonable attorney's fees in accordance with the following subsections: 
(1)  Attorney's fees are not recoverable by any person as a prevailing party unless the city administrator elects in writing to seek recovery of the city's attorney's fees at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding. Failure to make such an election precludes any entitlement to, or award of, attorney's fees in favor of any person or the city. 
(2)  The city is the prevailing party when an administrative or judicial determination is made or affirmed by which a person is found to be responsible for one or more conditions or activities that constitute a public nuisance. A person is the prevailing party only when a final administrative or judicial determination completely absolves that person of responsibility for all conditions or activities that were alleged in that action or proceeding to constitute a public nuisance. An administrative or judicial determination that results in findings of partial responsibility and partial non-responsibility on the part of a person for conditions or activities that were alleged in that action or proceeding to constitute a public nuisance shall nevertheless result in the city being the prevailing party. 
(b)  Provided that the city has made an election to seek attorney's fees, an award of attorney's fees to a person shall not exceed the amount of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city in that action or proceeding. 
(Ord. No. 622, § 1, 9-29-2009) 
9.32.260 - Applicability of other laws. 
(a)  This chapter does not exclusively regulate the conditions and use of property within the city. This chapter shall supplement other provisions of this code and other statutes, ordinances or regulations now existing or subsequently enacted by the city, the state or any other entity or agency having jurisdiction. 
(b)  The procedures for abatement set forth in this chapter are not exclusive and are in addition to any other provisions set forth in this code or by state law for the abatement of public nuisances and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, phrases, or portions be declared invalid or unconstitutional."

CHAPTER 9.33 - ABANDONED AND VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE 

9.33.010 - Title.

CHAPTER 9.90 - PROHIBITION AGAINST CERTAIN FORMS OF AGGRESSIVE AND UNSAFE PANHANDLING 

9.90.010 - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  The purpose and intent of this chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of the general public and improve the quality of life of the City of Commerce by imposing reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on aggressive, intrusive or unsafe panhandling while respecting the constitutional rights of free speech for all citizens. 
(b)  Aggressive and intrusive panhandling typically includes approaching or following pedestrians, the use of abusive language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The city council finds that an increase in aggressive panhandling throughout the city has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public, but has also created an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(c)  The city council finds that panhandling from people in places where they are a "captive audience," in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid panhandling from others, is problematic and presents a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops, as well as gasoline stations. The city council further finds that the presence of individuals who panhandle money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially threatening and dangerous. Such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both person and property. Restricting panhandling in such places will provide a balance between the rights of panhandlers and the rights of persons who wish to decline or avoid such panhandlings, and will help avoid or diminish the threat of violence in such unwarranted and unavoidable confrontations. 
(d)  The city council finds that panhandling on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers, drivers, pedestrians, and the general public. Panhandling on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems. 
(e)  The city council further finds that the practice of panhandling near driveways accessing shopping centers, retail, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for panhandlers, drivers, pedestrians and the general public. The location of the panhandler near the driveway compromises the panhandler's safety, impedes visibility, and impairs a driver's ability to safely enter and exit. Drivers also become distracted from their duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, and delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems. 
(f)  This law is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. The restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest. The goal of this law is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of panhandling that have become an unwelcome presence in the city, and to protect the safety of the general public. 
(Ord. No. 692, § 2, 1-19-2018)

(3)  Intentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a pedestrian or vehicle by any means, including unreasonably causing a pedestrian or vehicle operator to take evasive action to avoid physical contact; 
(4)  Persisting in closely following or approaching a person, after the person has informed a panhandler that such person does not want to be panhandled or does not want to give money or any other thing of value to the panhandler; 
(5)  Using violent or threatening gestures toward a person; or 
(6)  Using profane, offensive or abusive language that is inherently likely to provoke an immediate reaction either before, during or after panhandling.

(k)  "Public transportation vehicle" means any vehicle, including a trailer bus, or train, designed, used or maintained for carrying ten or more persons, including the driver; or a passenger vehicle designed for carrying fewer than ten persons, including the driver, and used to carry passengers for hire.

(b)  Upon receipt of the application, the superintendent of streets will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon his approval of that designation, he will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways and general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes. No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without the approval of Caltrans. 
(c)  Should the requested route pass through the city to a terminal located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall, in addition to complying with subsection (a) of this section, comply with the jurisdiction's application process. Coordination of the approval of the route through the city will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal's land use.

Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point in the city on route to the terminal, and terminal designation signs will be required at each approved terminal. Upon completion of the installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. Costs for trailblazer signs may be apportioned in accordance with the procedures in Section 10.54.050(c).

Adjustments between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the work and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. When the work is done by the applicant, the applicant may file with the superintendent of streets, on a form satisfactory to the superintendent of streets, a statement detailing the actual costs of the retrofitting. 
(c)  If at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any applicant seek terminal approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicant's fee may include that applicant's proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the superintendent of streets, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing herein shall require the payment of proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the report with the superintendent of streets required by subsection (b) above. 
(Ord. 370 §1(part), 1985). 
10.54.060 - Revocation of route. 
    The superintendent of streets may revoke any approved terminal or route if the terminal or route becomes a traffic hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or said vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic or pedestrians. 
(Ord. 370 §1(part), 1985). 
10.54.070 - Appeal process. 
(a)  If the superintendent of streets denies terminal designation, route feasibility or revokes a previously approved terminal or route, the applicant/terminal owner, within ten days following the date of receipt of the decision of the superintendent of streets may appeal said decision to the city council in writing. An appeal shall be filed with the city clerk.

Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the superintendent of streets shall transmit to the city clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith the report of the superintendent of streets, the findings of the superintendent of streets and his decision on the application. 
(b)  The city clerk shall make copies of the data provided by the superintendent of streets available to the applicant and to the appellant (if the applicant is not the appellant) for inspection and may give notice to any other interested party who has requested notice of the time when the appeal will be considered by the city council. Upon receipt of the appeal, the city council may take any of the following actions: 
(1)  Approve the decision; 
(2)  Refer the matter back to the superintendent of streets with or without instructions; 
(3)  Set the matter for public hearing before itself. Such public hearings shall be held de novo as if no hearings previously had been held.

Footnotes: 
--- () --- 
2.  For statutory provisions pertaining to subdivided lands and subdivisions, see Bus. & Prof. C.A., Section 11000 et seq. 

12.08.010 - Purpose. 
    In enacting this chapter, the city council hereby finds that this city has experienced explosive increases in land development for high activity purposes, the direct result of which is to rapidly render the previously existing streets and highways inadequate in width and development to provide minimum acceptable service capacity to the lands being developed, and, therefore, the public is being denied streets and highways of minimum standards for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access and travel. 
    Therefore, the provisions hereof are intended officially to define the requirements, policies, and procedures for the acquisition of public improvements of property, in order to: 
(1)  Supplement and insure conformity to Title 19, the subdivision map act and to other applicable provisions of this code, and to extend the basic requirements thereunder, to apply to land development in which no subdivision is involved; 
(2)  Spread the costs of required public improvements upon the abutting properties as contemplated by law; 
(3)  Protect the vested interest of the public in the pre-existing capacity of city streets and highways, and to provide for private participation in the widening and improvement of streets and highways when the same becomes necessary by reason of development of abutting property; 
(4)  Protect the public safety and general welfare of the general public. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7400). 
12.08.020 - Intent. 
    Compliance with the requirements provided herein is not intended to relieve any further and additional obligations with respect to streets imposed by reason of other regulations of city or as may be provided for by agreement with the city. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7401). 
12.08.030 - Constructing buildings, off-street parking-Street improvements. 
    Except as otherwise provided herein, any person constructing, adding to, or arranging for the construction of, or addition to any off-street parking facilities, or any building in the city, the result of which, in the opinion of the city administrator, effects an increase in the density of use of the property or effects an increase of the traffic generation on the street in question, shall also provide for the construction of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and street paving to meet the existing street pavement, in accordance with city's standard specifications and design along all public streets frontage adjoining the property upon which such work is to be done, unless curbs, gutters, sidewalks and paving constructed in accordance with city standards and design therefor already exist. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7402 (part)). 
12.08.040 - Permit for construction. 
    A permit for such work shall be applied for in accordance with and subject to the provisions of all applicable laws in addition to the special provisions herein provided. The permit shall be issued, or a variance as provided in Section 12.08.050 shall be granted, prior to or in conjunction with the issuance of any building permits or other permits for the property. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7402 (part)). 
12.08.050 - Variance from construction requirements. 
(a)  A variance from the application of Section 12.04.030 in requiring public street improvements to be installed in conjunction with improvements to the abutting property may be granted under the following circumstances: 
(1)  Where the city engineer finds and determines that area drainage facilities are inadequate and that the installation of all or a portion of the required public improvements would endanger the public welfare by reason thereof; or 
(2)  Where the city engineer determines that it would be in the best interest of the city to cause all or a portion of the required work to be done on an area project basis rather than on an individual basis; or 
(3)  Where the city administrator finds and determines that the requirements, as applied to an individual property, by reason of exceptional or extraordinary situation or condition of the property, or the location thereof, or of the use or development of property in the immediate vicinity of the property, will involve practical difficulties or would cause undue hardship, unnecessary to carry out the purposes and spirit of this chapter. 
(b)  Variance shall not be granted nor become effective unless and until an agreement between the property owner and the city of Commerce is properly executed, agreeing that the property owner will undertake the construction of the required improvements as required by these regulations within ninety days after notice to begin the construction of the improvements is sent by the city to the property owner. The agreement shall further provide that, in the event of default in undertaking and completing the required improvements within the time specified, the city may cause the work to be done and the cost thereof to be assessed as a lien against the property. The agreement shall recite that it runs with the land and shall be recorded in order to constitute notice to any prospective buyers or encumbrancers. The city administrator is hereby authorized to execute such an agreement for and on behalf of the city. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7403).

    Prior to the issuance of any building permits, or other permits, for the improvement or use of property adjoining a public street, there shall be dedicated to the city of Commerce that part of the property sufficient to bring said public street up to the width line established therefor. In the event existing buildings or other structural improvements are located within the right-of-way to be dedicated, the city shall compensate the owner for the costs of removing and relocating the improvements to the remaining property, or shall grant a waiver of the dedication requirement, as the city council may determine. 
(Ord. 62 §1 (part), 1962: prior code §7405). 
12.08.080 - Exceptions.

12.08.090 - Final inspection of improvements.

(b)  Whenever it is found by the city engineer that water rights required by this section to be deeded to the city have not been previously deeded to the city and are not available to the owner of the land at the time these requirements for dedication apply, such landowner shall pay to the city the cost of acquiring comparable water rights as determined by the city administrator.

CHAPTER 15.05 - ABATEMENT OF UNUSED OR ABANDONED SERVICE STATIONS 

15.05.010 - Purpose. 
    The council declares that its purpose in adopting this chapter is to eliminate public nuisances that are created when service stations are abandoned or unused for long periods of time. The council finds and determines that: 
(1)  The fire code of the city requires that underground tanks that were used to store flammable or combustible liquids be removed or filled completely with an inert material whenever such tanks are taken out of service for ninety days or more; 
(2)  Abandoned or unused service stations, the underground storage tanks of which have been removed or filled with inert material, often cannot thereafter be used as service stations, because the cost of replacing such underground tanks or restoring them to serviceable condition is excessive in relation to the economic benefit to be derived therefrom; 
(3)  Unused or abandoned service stations often cannot be easily or inexpensively adapted to other uses (even assuming such is allowed in the particular zone or zones where such service stations are situated), because of their unique location in relation to the property lines of their lots, their unique architectural design, and their unique structural appurtenances; 
(4)  Unused or abandoned service stations are often situated in locations that are uneconomic for such uses, as demonstrated by frequent changes of ownership thereof and the service stations in the city that are now unused and which have been unused for more than twelve months; 
(5)  Unused or abandoned service stations constitute dangers to the public health, welfare and safety, in that such conditions invite vandalism, arson, other fire hazards, rodent infestation, and unsightliness and blight that depreciate values of surrounding properties; 
(6)  The existence of such conditions contravene the purposes of the zoning ordinances and the general plan of the city, in that planning for a compatible blend of land uses will be disrupted because the lands affected cannot be reasonably put to other uses until the existing conditions are abated by restoration or removal of the buildings, and also in that planning for other uses will be prevented unless such abatement is accomplished; 
(7)  The existence of unused or abandoned service stations is injurious and inimical to the public health, safety, comfort and welfare of the community, in that such conditions invite unsightliness, blight, fire hazards, infestation, decreasing values to surrounding properties, and vandalism, and the existence of conditions which invite such ills constitute such abuses of property as to entitle this city to exercise its police powers in order to protect the health, safety, comfort and welfare of the community and of its residents; 
(8)  That the provisions of this chapter are categorically exempt under this city's adopted environmental guidelines and procedures; 
(9)  This city has the responsibility for strict enforcement of zoning and building regulations and that in the interest of safeguarding the public health, safety, comfort and welfare of the community, abatement is now required of abandoned or unused service stations; 
(10)  Unless corrective measures are undertaken to alleviate such present conditions, and particularly, to avoid future problems in this regard, a serious threat to the public health, safety, comfort and welfare of the residents and a serious threat to the values of surrounding properties in this city will continue to exist; that the need of the city to deal with conditions under the procedures established in this chapter outweighs the utility of the conditions as they exist; and that the procedures established in this chapter for the abatement, demolition and removal and/or enjoinment of the conditions declared by this chapter to constitute public nuisances are declared to be necessary and reasonable, and that they afford a maximum of due process. 
(Ord. 229 (part), 1976). 
15.05.020 - Enforcement authority. 
    There is delegated to the director of community development and the city officers or employees whom he shall designate, the authority to implement the provisions of this chapter wherever their action is required. 
(Ord. 229 (part), 1976). 
15.05.030 - Service station defined. 
    As used in this chapter, "service station" means any lot or parcel of real property, the buildings of which are designed and built for the purpose of dispensing and selling fuels for internal combustion engines of any type or types of automotive vehicles, whether or not containing facilities for the provision of other services to customers.

CHAPTER 19.07 - RESIDENTIAL ZONES 
DIVISION 1. - PERMITTED USES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

19.07.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A.  Three residential zones are established to provide residents with a comfortable, healthy, safe, and pleasant living environment. These zones should be separated from incompatible and disruptive activities that may conflict with this purpose. The various zones are designed to accommodate specific types of living situations, such as single-family and multifamily housing, in sufficient supply to serve the needs of the city's residents. 
1.  Low Density Residential Zone (R-1). The purpose of the R-1 zone is to provide areas for the development of detached and attached single-family dwellings that incorporate private outdoor open spaces into individual living environments. The zone is intended to protect and stabilize desirable characteristics of single-family residential areas, such as minimum lot sizes and separation from incompatible land uses. 
2.  Medium Density Residential Zone (R-2). The purpose of the R-2 residential zone is to provide an environment suitable for both single-family and duplex units. The intent is to promote desirable characteristics for medium-density living and to stabilize existing medium-density areas. Lots in the R-2 zone may accommodate one or two single-family detached units or duplex units. 
3.  High Density Residential Zone (R-3). The purpose of the R-3 zone is to provide opportunities for persons to live in medium- or high-density residential developments. Lots in this zone provide common open space areas and similar amenities. The R-3 zone is primarily intended to accommodate apartments and other multi-family dwellings, although single-family and duplex residences are also permitted. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.07.020 - Use regulations. 
A.  Table 19.07.020A identifies the uses permitted in the R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones. Residential uses represent the primary permitted use, and only those additional uses that are complementary to, and can exist in harmony with, the residential character of each zone may be allowed as conditionally permitted, accessory, and temporary uses, as indicated in Table 19.07.020A. 
B.  Certain permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses may be subject to special conditions regarding the location, operation, or design of the use. Such uses are marked in Table 19.07.020A with an asterisk (*), and the special conditions that apply are contained in Chapter 19.31 (Standards for Specific Land Uses) of this title. 
C.  When a use is not specifically listed, the community development director shall have the authority to determine what use the proposed use is most similar to and whether such proposed use is permitted within the context of existing regulations.

DIVISION 2. - COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES 

19.07.120 - Intent, purpose, and applicability. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The city recognizes the need of all persons to have equal access to housing and to live in an environment that facilitates the development of healthy individuals, families, and community. The city also recognizes the need to preserve the character of its residential neighborhoods and to ensure that all uses within those neighborhoods contribute to the overall health and safety of the neighborhoods. Therefore, the city establishes these regulations for nontraditional residential facilities that are permitted in the R-3 zone subject to conditional use permit review and approval. 
B.  Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all community care facilities housing more than six unrelated persons living together. A community care facility or group home which serves six or fewer residents shall be considered a residential use of property and shall not be subject to these regulations. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.07.130 - Use regulations. 
A.  As indicated in Table 19.07.020A, community care facilities are permitted in the R-3 zone, subject to conditional use permit review and approval. The planning commission may use the following grounds to deny a conditional use permit: 
1.  Approval of the proposed facility would result in an overconcentration of such facilities within the neighborhood where the facility is to be operated. For the purposes of this Title 19, "overconcentration" shall mean that one or more similar approved uses is located within three hundred feet of the proposed facility; or 
2.  The proposed facility is located within one mile of an elementary school and a person who has been convicted of a sex offense against a minor, pursuant to Section 1564 of the Health and Safety Code, resides in the facility and such residence will continue after the permit is granted; or 
3.  Such use cannot be sufficiently conditioned to make it compatible with surrounding uses. 
B.  Any violation of Section 1564 of the Health and Safety Code shall be cause for revocation of the conditional use permit.

D.  For the purposes of this article, the "total units" or "total dwelling units" in a housing development does not include those units added by any density bonus. 
E.  Regardless of the number or extent of affordable units, senior housing, land dedication, childcare facilities or other qualifications for a density bonus provided in any single housing development, no housing development may be entitled to a total density bonus of more than thirty-five percent.

19.07.220 - Incentives and concessions for affordable housing. 
A.  Definition of a Qualified Incentive or Concession. A qualifying project shall be entitled to at least one but no more than three of the following incentives identified by state law: 
1.  A reduction in the parcel development standards (e.g., coverage, setback, zero lot line and/or reduced parcel sizes, architectural design requirements and/or parking requirements). Development standard means any ordinance, general plan element, specific plan, condition, law, policy, resolution, or regulation. In no case may the city apply a development standard that will have the effect of precluding the construction of affordable units. A waiver or modification to development standards may be requested by the applicant, and shall be approved unless such waiver or modification creates an adverse impact as described in subsection (C)(2) below. 
2.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing project, and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing project and existing or planned development in the area where the proposed development will be located. 
3.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the city that will result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. 
B.  Number of Incentives or Concessions. The number of incentives shall be based on the percentage of affordable units in the project: 
1.  One incentive or concession shall be entitled for projects where at least five percent of the total units are for very low income households, ten percent of the total units are for lower income households, or ten percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
2.  Two incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least ten percent of the total units are for very low income households, twenty percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least twenty percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
3.  Three incentives or concessions shall be entitled for projects where at least fifteen percent of the total units are for very low income households, thirty percent of the total units are for lower income households, or thirty percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
Table 6: Incentives and Concessions Summary Affordable Units or Category Percent of Affordable Units Affordable Housing Types: Very Low Income 5% 10% 15% Low Income 10% 20% 30% Moderate Income 10% 20% 30% Maximum Incentive(s)/Concession(s) 1,2,3 1 2 3  
Notes: 
1.  An incentive or concession may be requested only if an application is also made for a density bonus. 
2.  Incentives or concessions may be selected from only one category (very low, lower, or moderate). 
3.  No incentives or concessions are available for land donation. 
C.  Findings to Deny Incentive or Concession. The city shall grant the incentive or concession requested by the applicant unless the city makes a written finding based upon substantial evidence of any of the following: 
1.  The incentive or concession is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for affordable rents for the restricted units; 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate-income households. A specific adverse impact means a significant, unavoidable impact, as provided in written standards, policies, or conditions; or 
3.  The incentive or concession would be contrary to state or federal law. 
D.  Exceptions. This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly owned land, by the city or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. Nor does any provision of this section require the city to grant an incentive or concession found to have a specific adverse impact. 
E.  Amendment, Zone Change. The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, local coastal plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.230 - Waivers and modifications of development standards. 
A.  Applicants granted a density bonus pursuant to Section 19.07.170 of this article may, by written proposal, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this article. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city to discuss such request for waiver and modifications. 
B.  In order to obtain a waiver or modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of Section 19.07.170 of this article, at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this article. 
C.  A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to Section 19.07.220 of this article. 
D.  The city may deny a request for any waiver, modification or reduction of development standards if the wavier, modification or reduction would have a specific adverse impact. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.240 - Parking incentives. 
    Upon the written request of the applicant for a housing development meeting the criteria for a density bonus under Section 19.07.170 of this article, the city shall not require a vehicular parking ratio that exceeds the following: 
A.  Zero to one bedroom units: One onsite parking space. 
B.  Two to three bedroom units: Two onsite parking spaces. 
C.  Four and more bedroom units: Two and one-half parking spaces. 
    Guest parking and handicapped parking shall be included within the maximum number of spaces that may be required. If the total number of parking spaces required for a housing development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a housing development may provide onsite parking through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on street parking. For purposes of this article, the parking ratios set forth in this section shall be deemed a concession or incentive available to the applicant under Section 19.07.220 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.250 - Standards for density bonus housing developments. 
A.  Affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the housing development and compatible with the design of market rate units in terms of appearance, materials, and finished quality. The applicant may reduce the interior amenities and square footage of inclusionary units, provided all units conform to all other requirements of this municipal code. 
B.  For developments with multiple market rate units containing differing numbers of bedrooms, affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be representative of the market rate unit mix. 
C.  All building permits for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be issued concurrently with, or prior to, issuance of building permits for the market rate units, and the affordable units shall be constructed concurrently with, or prior to, construction of the market rate units. Occupancy permits and final inspections for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be approved concurrently with, or prior to, approval of occupancy permits and final inspections for the market rate units. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.260 - Application requirements. 
A.  An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this section shall be submitted with the first approval of the housing development and processed concurrently with all other applications required for the housing development. 
B.  For affordable units qualifying the housing development for a density bonus, the application shall include the following information: 
1.  A site plan identifying the base project without the density bonus, number and location of all inclusionary units, affordable units qualifying for the project for a density bonus, and proposed density bonus units; 
2.  Proposed category(ies) qualifying the housing development for a density bonus; 
3.  Level of affordability of all affordable and inclusionary units and proposals for ensuring affordability, if applicable; and 
4.  A description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards. 
5.  If a density bonus or concession is requested for a land donation, the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that each of the findings included in Section 19.07.180 of this article can be made. 
6.  If the density bonus or incentives of equivalent financial value are based upon a condominium conversion with affordable units or senior citizen housing, the application shall demonstrate that the project meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 19.07.180 of this article. 
7.  If a density bonus or concession is requested for a childcare facility, the application shall show the location and square footage of the childcare facility and provide evidence that the findings included in this section can be made. 
C.  Upon submission of the application to the city, the community development director or designee shall determine if the application is complete and conforms to the provisions of this article. No application for a first approval for a housing development requesting a density bonus, incentives, concessions, or waivers may be deemed complete unless an affordable housing plan is submitted conforming to the provisions of this article. 
D.  A request for a minor modification of an approved application may be granted by the city manager or designee if the modification is substantially in compliance with the original application and the conditions of approval. Other modifications to the affordable housing plan shall be processed in the same manner as the original application. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.270 - Application review. 
A.  An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this article shall be reviewed as part of the first approval of the housing development by the approval body with authority to approve the housing development, unless additional review by the planning commission or city council is required. An applicant proposing a housing development pursuant to this article, may submit a preliminary application prior to the submittal of any formal request for approval of a housing development. 
B.  Within ninety days of receipt of the preliminary application the city shall provide to an applicant, a letter which identifies project issues of concern (the maximum financial assistance that the community development director can support when making a recommendation to the city council), and the procedures for compliance with this article. The community development director shall inform the applicant that the requested additional incentives shall be recommended for consideration with the proposed housing development, or that alternative or modified additional incentives pursuant to Section 19.07.190 of this article shall be recommended for consideration in lieu of the requested incentives. If alternative or modified incentives are recommended by the community development director, the recommendation shall establish how the alternative or modified incentives can be expected to have an equivalent affordability effect as the requested incentives. 
C.  Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or modification, the approval body shall make the following findings: 
1.  The housing development is: a) eligible for a density bonus, and/or b) any concessions, incentives, waivers, modifications, or reduced parking standards requested conform to all requirements of this article, and c) supported by a financing mechanism for all implementation and monitoring costs. 
2.  If the density bonus is based all or in part on dedication of land, the application meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 19.07.180 of this article. 
3.  If the density bonus or incentives of equivalent financial value are based upon a condominium conversion with affordable units or senior citizen housing, that the application meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 19.07.190 of this article. 
4.  If the density bonus, incentive, or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a childcare facility, the application meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 19.07.200 of this article. 
5.  If a waiver or modification is requested, the applicant has shown that the waiver, modification or reduction of development standards meets the qualifications and findings stated in Section 19.07.230 of this article. 
D.  If the findings stated in subsection (B) of this section can be made, and a request for an incentive or concession is otherwise consistent with this article, the approval body may deny a concession or incentive based upon written findings of any of the factors stated in Section 19.07.220 of this article for the denial or disqualification of a concession or incentive. 
E.  If the required findings stated in subsection (B) of this section can be made, and a request for a waiver or modification is otherwise consistent with this article, the approval body may deny the requested waiver or modification based upon written findings of any of the factors stated in Section 19.07.230 of this article for the denial or disqualification of a waiver or modification. 
F.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to require the city to grant an incentive or concession or to waive or reduce development standards if that incentive, concession, waiver, or reduction has a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. 
G.  Any decision regarding a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard may be appealed pursuant to pursuant to Division 4 of Chapter 19.39 of the Commerce Municipal Code. In accordance with state law, neither the granting of a concession or incentive, nor the granting of a density bonus, shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 5 (Exh. B), 11-19-2013) 
19.07.280 - Developer affordable housing agreement. 
A.  Applications requesting a density bonus shall agree to enter into a density bonus housing agreement with the city. The terms of the draft agreement shall be reviewed and revised as appropriate by the community development director, who shall formulate a recommendation to the planning commission for final approval. A density bonus housing agreement shall be made a condition of the discretionary planning permits for all housing developments pursuant to this article and shall be recorded as a restriction on any parcels on which the affordable units or density bonus units will be constructed. 
B.  The density bonus housing agreement shall be recorded prior to final or parcel map approval, or, where the housing development does not include a map, prior to issuance of a building permit for any structure in the housing development. The density bonus housing agreement shall run with the land and bind future owners and successors in interest.

19.07.300 - Applicability. 
    In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, any person may request a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. 
    A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment.

Chapter 19.09 - COMMERCIAL ZONE 

19.09.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of the commercial (C-2) zone is to allow for the establishment and operation of retail and business uses in conveniently located areas of the city. These uses are intended to provide a variety of goods and services necessary to meet the needs of the resident and business populations. Development intensity is restricted in the commercial (C-2) zone to protect adjacent residential areas from unnecessary disruptions. Uses allowed in the C-2 zone include, but are not limited to, retail businesses, restaurants, personal services, offices, repair shops and parking. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.09.020 - Use regulations. 
A.  Table 19.09.010A identifies the uses permitted in the commercial (C-2) zone. Retail and service commercial uses represent the primary permitted uses, although other uses are allowed as accessory, conditionally permitted and temporary uses, as indicated in Table 19.09.010A. 
B.  Certain permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses may be subject to special conditions regarding the location, operation or design of the use. Such uses are marked in Table 19.09.010A with an asterisk (*), and the special conditions that apply are contained in Chapter 19.31 (Standards for Specific Land Uses). 
C.  When a use is not specifically listed, the community development director shall have the authority to determine what use the proposed use is most similar to and whether such proposed use is permitted within the context of existing regulations. 
D.  For any development or use proposal for which more than one use is proposed, and when at least one proposed use requires a conditional use permit, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the development or use application as a whole.

    Chapter 19.01: General Provisions 
    Chapter 19.15: Planned Development Overlay Zone 
    Chapter 19.19: Site Planning and General Development Standards 
    Chapter 19.21: Off-Street Parking and Loading

    Chapter 19.37: Nonconforming Uses and Structure 
CHAPTER 19.11 - MANUFACTURING ZONES 

19.11.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A.  Three manufacturing zones are established to provide locations for the assembly, manufacture, processing, and distribution of a wide variety of goods and materials, and to allow complementary commercial uses to locate in proximity to such uses. The different manufacturing zones are designed to concentrate these activities in appropriate areas of the city to promote efficiency in street and utility design, to segregate these uses from sensitive residential uses, and to ensure availability of adequate public services. 
1.  Commercial-Manufacturing (C/M-1). The C/M-1 zone is established to provide for a wide variety of commercial uses and limited, compatible light industrial uses. The intent of the zone is to concentrate these uses along major arterials and in other areas that provide easy access and convenience. The industrial uses considered appropriate in the C/M-1 zone are limited to support services, such as machine shops and some light manufacturing. Commercial or industrial uses that might create offensive levels of noise, air pollution, glare, radioactivity or other nuisances are prohibited from this zone. 
2.  Light Manufacturing Zone (M-1). The M-1 zone is designed to preserve city land appropriate for medium-intensity industrial uses, to attract and preserve desirable industrial plants, and to provide an aesthetically pleasing industrial environment. The intent of the M-1 zone is to provide safeguards and appropriate transitions to surrounding land uses that may be sensitive to industrial activities and to permit efficient design of infrastructure and public service to serve these uses. 
3.  Heavy Manufacturing Zone (M-2). The purpose of the M-2 zone is to provide land suitable for heavy industrial uses. This zone is also the only zone where adult businesses and adult entertainment enterprises may be located in the city. The requirements of the zone are intended to provide safeguards and to establish adequate buffer distances between uses that pose potentially adverse public health, safety, and welfare impacts and land uses in adjacent, more restrictive zone districts. 
(Ord. 544 §1(part), 2000). 
19.11.020 - Use regulations. 
A.  Table 19.11.030A identifies the uses permitted in the manufacturing districts. The uses identified in Table 19.11.030A are more precisely defined by reference to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual published by the federal government's Office of Management and Budget. The 1987 SIC Manual, or the most current edition of the manual, as amended, is incorporated herein by reference. The SIC Manual identifies businesses according to the operating characteristics involved in creating the product (for example, slaughtering, manufacturing pulp, manufacturing industrial inorganic chemicals, petroleum refining) and the effects that these characteristics may have on nearby uses. The actual product created is of secondary importance. 
B.  Certain permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses may be subject to special conditions regarding location, operation or the design of the use. Such uses are marked in Table 19.11.030A with an asterisk (*), and the special conditions that apply are contained in Chapter 19.31 (Standards for Specific Land Uses) of this title. 
C.  The "notes and exceptions" column of Table 19.11.030A indicates more precisely the use regulations for specific SIC codes or operating characteristics. The notes and exceptions must be reviewed in conjunction with the other information for that class of use. 
D.  For uses or activities not specifically identified in Table 19.11.030A, the community development director shall have the authority to interpret and assign the appropriate SIC code for that use or activity. The decision of the community development director can be appealed to the planning commission pursuant to Chapter 19.39, Division 4 (Appeals and Revocations) of this title. 
E.  Any use or activity not identified by an SIC code included in Table 19.11.030A, or any use or activity not interpreted by the community development director as belonging to a listed SIC code, shall be prohibited. 
(Ord. 579 §1, 2004; Ord. 575 §1, 2003; Ord. 574 §2, 2003; Ord. 544 §1(part), 2000). 
19.11.030 - Meaning of the P/C designation. 
A.  This section applies to those use categories in Table 19.11.030A classified as "P/C." "P/C" shall mean that the use is permitted by right unless the location criteria contained in Section 19.11.030(C) apply to the project, in which case conditional use permit (C) review shall be required pursuant to Chapter 19.39, Division 7 of this title. 
B.  The community development director shall be authorized to determine whether a use identified in Table 19.11.030A as "P/C" is permitted by right or requires discretionary review based on the criteria defined in this section. 
C.  The location of a proposed manufacturing or industrial use relative to residentially-zoned property shall represent the sole factor for determining whether discretionary review is required pursuant to this section. If any building housing the principal proposed use in an manufacturing district, or any outdoor activity which represents the principal use of the property, is located three hundred feet or less from the nearest residential district (see Figure 19.11.030-1), then conditional use permit review shall be required, as indicated in Table 19.11.030A.

2.  Primary structures should be oriented to face the street, avoiding views from the street of parking garages and alleys. Garages, parking, and loading areas shall not be the dominant element in the overall design of a project and should be designed to minimize visual disruption. 
3.  All building entrances shall be well articulated and project a formal entrance statement through variations in architectural planes, pavement surface treatment, and landscape plazas, as well as relate to pedestrians. 
4.  Building design and siting shall minimize negative impact on views from adjacent properties. 
5.  Buildings shall be oriented to encourage use of outdoor spaces. Outdoor spaces between buildings shall have clear, recognizable shapes that reflect careful planning and must be compatible with adjoining building orientation. 
6.  The scale of architectural details (doors, windows, porches, chimneys, etc.) shall be appropriate to the size and proportion of the building and relate to the scale and style of the building. 
7.  Building forms and details should be in keeping with adjacent neighborhood character where appropriate. 
8.  The mass and height of a new building shall not be disproportionate in size or designed to overwhelm neighboring structures. Upper stories should be stepped back from the ground level facade whenever possible to avoid overwhelming neighboring structures. 
9.  A building front should provide visual interest and a sense of human scale. Freestanding, singular buildings shall be oriented with their major facade and entry toward the street. 
10.  Building scale shall be reduced through window patterns, structural bays, roof overhangs, siding, awnings, moldings, fixtures and other details. 
B.  Grading: Alterations to natural grade, except for minor grading for landscaping purposes, is discouraged and building designs should follow the natural contours of the property. 
C.  Landscaping and Paving. 
1.  Tree preservation and landscaping with specimen trees is encouraged. 
2.  Landscaping shall be designed to minimize the impacts of development on surrounding properties and be used to provide privacy. 
3.  A combination of water-conserving landscape and irrigation techniques is required, such as the use of drought tolerant plant species. 
4.  Landscaping shall be used to define specific areas such as entrances to buildings and parking areas or transitions between land uses. 
5.  Landscaping shall be provided around the base of buildings to reduce building mass and height. 
6.  Use of quality materials, such as brick and exposed aggregate concrete, and use of porous materials is required. 
7.  Driveways and service areas shall be subordinate to and blend well with adjacent buildings. 
D.  Preservation. 
1.  Existing structures of historical character or of quality design shall be preserved and renovated where appropriate. 
2.  Where existing structures are preserved and incorporated into a development, the design of the development shall respect the character and siting of the existing structure to minimize impact on the neighborhood. 
E.  Architectural Treatments. 
1.  Exterior architectural treatments shall be of high quality and complement the overall design scheme. When appropriate, exterior architectural treatments shall complement existing structures in the immediate vicinity. 
2.  Accent treatment, such as changes in exterior materials and texture is required and a minimum of two primary building materials shall be 
3.  All exterior wall elevations of buildings shall have architectural treatment. 
4.  At ground level, expanses of blank building walls shall be minimized with creative use of materials, textures, color and/or building form. 
F.  Access and Circulation. 
1.  The access and circulation of a development shall be designed to provide a safe and efficient system, both on and off-site. 
2.  The circulation system shall be designed to reduce conflicts between vehicular and pedestrian traffic, minimize impacts on adjacent properties, combine circulation and access areas where possible, and provide adequate maneuvering areas. 
G.  Roofs. 
1.  Roofs shall be designed as an integral component of the overall form of a building and the design of roofs and rooflines should provide visual interest from the street and should complement overall facade composition. 
2.  Roof lines of new structures shall be compatible with the character of roofs seen in the surrounding neighborhood where appropriate. 
H.  Green Design. Design and construction techniques that are responsive to the environment and environmental resources are encouraged. Development strategies should consider sustainable site planning, water efficiency, energy efficiency and the conservation of materials and resources. 
I.  Signage. On-site signs shall serve their primary purpose of identifying the business or activity of the site on which they are located and shall not present traffic or other public safety hazards, while complimenting the buildings and site design of the site on which they are located.

CHAPTER 19.21 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

19.21.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of the parking and loading requirements identified in this Chapter 19.21 is to ensure that all land uses in the city provide adequate off-street parking facilities, loading areas, and vehicle movement area associated with a use. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the use of land does not interfere adversely with the circulation of public rights-of-way, that private on-site circulation does not pose a potential safety issue, and that surrounding uses are insulated from the noise and traffic impacts associated with off-street parking and loading activities. 
(Ord. 544 §1(part), 2000). 
19.21.020 - Applicability. 
A.  The minimum standards of this Chapter 19.21 shall apply to all new construction, expansion, renovation, conversion, and alteration of existing uses or structures in all zone districts. 
B.  Off-street parking spaces shall be provided at the time of commencement of the use of the land or construction of the building, or at the time of renovation, conversion, alteration, or expansion by adding floor area, dwelling units, rooms, beds, or seats to a structure. 
(Ord. 544 §1(part), 2000). 
19.21.030 - Restrictions on use of parking facilities. 
A.  Required parking spaces and areas shall not be used for the sale or display of goods and services, nor for the sale, display, repair or dismantling of motor vehicles, nor for the storage of inoperable or unlicensed vehicles, unless otherwise permitted by subsection C of this section. 
B.  Parking areas in any zone may be used for temporary, special events with authorization from the owner or operator of the parking area and the planning commission. The commission may impose conditions to mitigate any adverse effect on surrounding properties. Provisions outlined in Chapter 19.39, Division 11 (Temporary Use Permits and Special Events Permits) shall govern the procedures and conditions for the application and approval of a temporary use/special event permit. 
(Ord. 544 §1(part), 2000). 
19.21.040 - Number of parking spaces required. 
    Table 19.21.040A specifies the number of off-street parking spaces required for permitted land uses. 
A.  Fractional Spaces. All fractional spaces shall be rounded up to the next highest whole number. 
B.  Combined Uses. When two or more uses are combined on a given site, the required parking shall be calculated as the combined total required for each individual use. Where two or more uses exist within a single building, parking shall be calculated based on the percentage of floor area devoted to each use. 
C.  Compact and Handicap Parking. The calculation of the number of compact and handicap parking spaces to be provided shall be based on the total number of spaces required. Handicapped (accessible) parking shall comply with standards set forth in Chapter 11 of the Uniform Building Code. 
D.  Unspecified Land Use. If a land use is not specifically listed in Table 19.21.040A, the community development director shall decide which standard most closely reflects the demand for parking that will be generated by the proposed project.

9.  Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging directly to an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA), where the development will: 
a.  Discharge stormwater runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive biological species or habitat; and 
b.  Create two thousand five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area. 
10.  Single-family hillside homes. 
11.  Redevelopment projects. 
a.  Land disturbing activity that results in the creation or addition or replacement of five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site on planning priority project categories. 
b.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated. 
c.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development. 
d.  Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities that are conducted to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, original purpose of facility or emergency redevelopment activity required to protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing roads to maintain original line and grade. 
e.  Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are exempt from the redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add, or replace ten thousand square feet of impervious surface area. 
12.  Any other project as deemed appropriate by the director. 
D.  Effective Date. The planning and land development requirements contained in this chapter shall become effective thirty days from the adoption of the chapter. This includes planning priority projects that are discretionary permit projects or project phases that have not been deemed complete for processing, or discretionary permit projects without vesting tentative maps that have not requested and received an extension of previously granted approvals within ninety days of adoption of the chapter. Projects that have been deemed complete within ninety days of adoption of the chapter are not subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
E.  Stormwater Pollution Control Requirements. The site for every planning priority project shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use. 
1.  A new single-family hillside home development shall include mitigation measures to: 
a.  Conserve natural areas; 
b.  Protect slopes and channels; 
c.  Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage; 
d.  Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in slope instability; and 
e.  Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless the diversion would result in slope instability. 
2.  Street and road construction projects with construction costs greater than five hundred thousand dollars and add at least ten thousand square feet of impervious surface shall follow the City of Commerce's Green Streets Policy and Guidelines. 
3.  The remainder of planning priority projects shall prepare a LID plan to comply with the following: 
a.  Retain stormwater runoff onsite for the stormwater quality design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from: 
i.  The 85th percentile twenty-four-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or 
ii.  The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, twenty-four-hour rain event, whichever is greater. 
b.  Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in the municipal NPDES permit. Hydromodification requirements are further specified in post-construction BMP handbooks such as CASQA's. 
c.  When, as determined by the approving agency, one hundred percent onsite retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, partially or fully, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID plan. The technical infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to: 
i.  The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite. 
ii.  Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade; 
iii.  Locations within one hundred feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water; 
iv.  Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern; 
v.  Locations with potential geotechnical hazards; 
vi.  Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement. 
d.  If partial or complete onsite retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. If hazardous waste contamination results in technical infeasibility, the project site may biofiltrate the remaining SWQDv portion that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in the municipal NPDES permit. 
i.  Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite infiltration may be available to the project site. The project site should contact the approving agency to determine eligibility. Alternative compliance options are further specified in CASQA's Post-Construction BMP Handbook. 
e.  The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per the municipal NPDES permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of: 
i.  0.2 inches per hour; or 
ii.  The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater. 
f.  A multi-phased project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system acceptable to the approving agency to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire site during the first phase, and (b) implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of development or redevelopment of the site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, "multi-phased project" shall mean any planning priority project implemented over more than one phase and the site of a multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the development or redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such development or redevelopment. 
F.  Other Agencies of City. All city departments, offices, entities and agencies, shall establish administrative procedures necessary to implement the provisions of this article on their development and redevelopment projects and report their activities annually to the community development department. 
G.  Validity. If any provision of this chapter is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect remaining provisions of this chapter that are declared to be severable.

CHAPTER 19.37 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 

19.37.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this Chapter 19.37 is to set forth zoning provisions regulating nonconforming uses, structures, and lots within the city and to provide for the transition of all nonconforming uses, structures, and lots in such a way that the interest of the community in improving the health, safety, and welfare of all residents is achieved without creating an economic hardship for individual property owners. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.020 - Establishment of nonconforming status. 
A.  The regulations in this Chapter 19.37 shall apply to all existing nonconforming uses, structures, and lots as defined in Chapter 19.45 (Definitions) of this Title 19, and to any use, building, structure, or lot made nonconforming upon adoption of this and subsequent ordinances. 
B.  Whenever a use, structure, development standard, or lot becomes nonconforming because of a change of zone boundaries or a change of regulations for the zone in which it is located, the period of time prescribed in this chapter for the elimination of the use or compliance with development standards shall be computed from the date of the notice of the nonconformity following the effective date of the change of zone boundaries or regulations. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.030 - Exceptions to nonconforming status. 
A.  No existing use of land or structure shall be deemed nonconforming solely because of the lack of off-street parking required by this Chapter. See also Division 4 of this Chapter 19.37. 
B.  No residential dwelling shall be deemed nonconforming solely because it does not meet required off-street parking or side yard setbacks; provided, it complies with the side yard setback requirements in effect at the time a building permit was issued for its construction. 
C.  An existing use shall be deemed a "legal nonconforming use" if prior to its establishment, the required permits were obtained (for example, a building permit, conditional use permit, etc.). 
D.  Structures and uses not having acquired the proper permits shall be considered illegal and shall be subject to immediate abatement pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 1.12 of the Commerce Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.040 - Continuation and maintenance. 
A.  A legally established and existing nonconforming use or structure may continue to be used until such time it is required to be abated, as set forth in this Chapter 19.37; provided, no alterations, expansions, or modifications, or area or use are made, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter. 
B.  Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on a structure or site when the use is nonconforming, and on a nonconforming structure. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.050 - Nonconforming status tied to property. 
    Restrictions and conditions affecting nonconforming uses, structures, and lots shall apply to the existing use, building, and structures, and shall not be affected by ownership changes.

19.37.060 - Revocation of privileges. 
A.  Whenever the use, maintenance, or continuation of nonconforming conditions or a nonconforming use is granted through the means of conditional use permit, variance, site plan review, extensions, expansions, or other approved changes, the same may be revoked by the planning commission whenever the planning commission finds: 
1.  That the terms or conditions of any conditional use permit, variance, site plan review, extension, expansion, or other approval are being violated; or 
2.  That the condition or use of the property constitutes a public nuisance; or 
3.  That the health, safety, or general welfare of the surrounding property owners or residents is being threatened by the continuation of such nonconforming use or condition. 
B.  The revocation process may be initiated by the order of the community development director in accordance with the provisions outlined in Division 6 (Abatement Proceedings) of this chapter. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.070 - Public nuisance. 
    Any nonconforming use or structure continuing beyond the date for abatement set by the planning commission shall be deemed a public nuisance, subject to abatement thereof and prosecution either through civil or criminal action, pursuant to Chapter 1.12 of the city of Commerce Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.080 - Exceptions-Public utility facilities and uses. 
    Nothing in this Chapter 19.37 pertaining to nonconforming uses, structures, and lots shall be construed or applied so as to require the termination or removal, or so as to prevent the modernization, replacement, repair, maintenance, alteration, or rebuilding of public service and public utility buildings, structures, uses, equipment, and facilities; provided, that there is no change or increase of those areas to be used.

19.37.270 - Notice required. 
A.  Upon determination by the community development director that the provisions in this Chapter 19.37 apply to a given parcel of land, the director shall send a notice regarding the parcel by a method guaranteeing certification of delivery to the owner of the parcel, as shown on the last equalized assessment roll. The director shall post the property with a similar notice. Should the certified notice be returned to the city for any reason, the city shall cause a copy of the same to be mailed by regular first-class mail, with postage thereon fully paid, to the property owner shown on the last equalized assessment roll. 
B.  The notice required in subsection A of this section shall state that the property in question is a nonconformity, shall state the date of abatement established in either Section 19.37.120 (Nonconforming uses-Abatement) or 19.37.150 (Nonconforming structures-Abatement), shall state that a hearing will be held before the planning commission, and shall state the date of such hearing. 
C.  The absence of such notification shall affect or extend the termination date established by the provisions of this Title 19 or the provisions of previous zoning regulations. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.280 - Hearing required. 
A.  Within thirty days after the issuance of the notice prescribed in Section 19.37.270 (Notice required), the planning commission shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the nonconformity should be abated or whether a time extension should be granted as provided for in Section 19.37.320 (Extension of time). Notice of the hearing shall be given to all property owners as required by Section 19.39.140 (Noticing) of this Title 19. 
B.  The planning commission shall receive written and oral testimony at such hearing with regard to abatement or elimination of the nonconformity pursuant to the hearing procedures set forth in Section 19.39.170 (Hearing procedures) of this Title 19. 
C.  At the close of the public hearing, the commission shall find and determine whether the nonconformity should be abated and all facts in support thereof, whether the owner of the property can amortize his investment in the term for abatement provided in Sections 19.37.120 (Nonconforming uses-Abatement) and 19.37.150 (Nonconforming structures-Abatement), and if not, what term for abatement should be provided. The commission shall base its decision as to the length of the permitted amortization period on any competent evidence presented, included but not limited to the depreciation schedule attached to the owner's latest federal income tax return. 
D.  The planning commission shall also find and determine whether the nonconformity can economically be used in its present condition or if the nonconformity can be successfully modified for a purpose permitted by the zone district in which it is located. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.290 - Findings and decision. 
A.  The decision of the planning commission and the findings in support of the decision shall be in the form of a written order and shall be served to the property owner personally or by a method guaranteeing proof of delivery within ten days after the decision is rendered. 
B.  Findings shall be made as to whether or not the balancing of the public interest and the request by the owner for continuance, alteration, or expansion of the nonconformity of the subject property requires a deviation from the development standards for the city of Commerce. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.300 - Right of appeal. 
    The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 19.39, Division 4 (Appeals and Revocations) of this Title 19. Any appeal timely filed shall be set for hearing in accordance with Chapter 19.39, Division 4. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000).

    After the conclusion of all appeals or, if no appeal is filed, after expiration of the appeal period, the city clerk shall cause notice of the decision to be recorded with the County Recorder of the County of Los Angeles. The notice shall consist of a notice of zoning violation. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.320 - Extension of time. 
A.  In establishing the time periods for the termination of nonconforming uses and structures, it is recognized that there may be some uses or structures which entail a substantial investment in time and money and which require a greater period of time for amortization of the investment than that set forth in the time table. Any party may file a petition to the planning commission for an extension of time for the termination of nonconforming uses or structures. The planning commission shall direct the community development director to conduct a study of the specific use or structure and prepare a report recommending the appropriate time for termination of the use or structure. 
B.  The planning commission, or the city council on appeal, at its discretion, may grant an extension of time for the abatement of a nonconformity where it finds that an unreasonable hardship would otherwise be imposed on the property owner. 
(Ord. 544 § 1(part), 2000). 
19.37.330 - City removal. 
    If removal of a nonconforming structure or use is not performed within the termination period, the city shall have the authority to remove the nonconforming use or structure. Any cost of removal shall be charged to the property owner and collected directly or as a special assessment on the land.

The variance procedure is provided pursuant to Section 65906 of the California Government Code to grant relief from zoning provisions when, because of special circumstances applicable to a property, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings, the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification. 
B.  Variances shall not be granted to authorize a use or activity on a property which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the provisions of this zoning ordinance governing that property. A variance is not a substitute for a zone change, zone text amendment, or conditional use permit.

A.  That the strict or literal interpretation and application of this Title 19 would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of this Title 19, or would deprive applicants of privileges granted to others in similar circumstances; and 
B.  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or the intended development of the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same zone; and 
C.  That the granting of such variance will not constitute the granting of a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity classified in the same zone; and 
D.  That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare nor injurious to property or improvements in the zone or neighborhood in which the property is located; and

CHAPTER 19.47 - HOUSING OPPORTUNITY OVERLAY ZONE 

19.47.010 - Intent and purpose. 
A.  The housing opportunity overlay zone (HOO) is established to facilitate the development of housing "by-right" on underutilized industrial sites. The HOO zone is intended to be applied to properties that are currently zoned heavy manufacturing (M-2) and permits discontinued manufacturing uses to recycle to residential development. The overlay zone is further intended to serve as an implementation tool of the city's housing element of the general plan by facilitating residential development on identified "housing opportunity sites." 
B.  The HOO has the following major objectives: 
1.  Create "by-right" opportunities for residential development on underutilized manufacturing sites. 
2.  Implement state laws that require cities to demonstrate available land capacity and zoning tools to accommodate the city's projected need for housing. 
3.  Provide a mix of housing types. 
4.  Facilitate well-designed new mixed-use development projects that combine residential and nonresidential uses (e.g., office, retail, business services, personal services, public spaces and uses, other community amenities, etc.) to promote a better balance of jobs and housing. 
5.  Stimulate economic development and reinvestment through regulations based upon recognized urban design principles that allow property owners to respond with flexibility to market forces. 
6.  Provide additional property rights while preserving existing property rights. This intent is achieved by providing additional development rights in compliance with this chapter, which property owners may exercise under certain conditions, while retaining all development rights conferred by the underlying zone to property owners in the HOO zone. Incentives and advantages include allowing a greater range and mix of uses and specifying more permissive dimensional specifications (e.g., greater floor area ratio, lot coverage ratio, and height, reduced setbacks, etc.). 
(Ord. No. 656, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-19-2013) 
19.47.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Application to Area. The HOO is an overlay zone to be used only in conjunction with an underlying heavy manufacturing (M-2) zone. The HOO area applies to approximately forty-four acres within the Rosewood Planning Area and is generally bounded by Harbor Street on the north, the Jillson Street on the south, Strong Avenue on the west and with no formal boundary on the east (eastern boundary is the Commerce Civic Center, Aquatorium and Rosewood Park), as depicted in Figure 1. 
FIGURE 1: HOUSING OPPORTUNITY OVERLAY ZONE 

B.  Relationship Between Base Zone Standards and Overlay Zone Standards. For property within the HOO zone, the regulations in this chapter allow residential and mixed-use development as an alternative to the stand-alone industrial development allowed under the base (underlying) zone standard. 
C.  Base Zone Standards. 
1.  The provisions in this chapter shall apply to all properties within the HOO zone, but the provisions do not supersede the underlying base zone provisions until a property is developed in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. New projects may be developed in compliance with the existing underlying base zone, provided that all standards and requirements of the underlying base zone are met. 
2.  Regulations, development standards, and requirements in the underlying base zone shall continue to apply to those projects that are currently developed according to the existing standards. 
3.  For legal nonconforming uses (i.e., uses that do not comply with the provisions of the base zone), the provisions in Chapter 19.37 (Nonconforming Uses and Structures) shall apply. 
D.  Option to Apply HOO Zone Standards. The owner or developer of any property within the HOO zone may choose to develop in compliance with the standards and procedures in this chapter. 
E.  Conversion of existing nonresidential structures into a residential use may be permitted subject to a conditional use permit pursuant to Chapter 19.39, Division 7 (Conditional Use Permit). 
F.  After Completion of Development. Once a property is developed in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter completely supersede the provisions of the underlying base zone. Whenever the requirements of the HOO zone impose a more or less restrictive standard than the provisions of the underlying base zone, the requirements of the HOO zone shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-19-2013) 
19.47.030 - Use regulations. 
A.  All uses in the applicable underlying zone are allowed. In addition, Table 19.11.030A identifies the uses permitted in the HOO zone. 
B.  Certain permitted uses and conditionally permitted uses may be subject to special conditions regarding location, operation or the design of the use. Such uses are marked in Table 19.11.030A with an asterisk (*), and the special conditions that apply are contained in Chapter 19.31 (Standards for Specific Land Uses) of this title. 
C.  The "notes and exceptions" column of Table 19.11.030A indicates more precisely the use regulations for specific operating characteristics. The notes and exceptions must be reviewed in conjunction with the other information for that class of use. 
D.  For uses or activities not specifically identified in Table 19.11.030A, the community development director shall have the authority to interpret and assign the use. The decision of the community development director can be appealed to the planning commission pursuant to Chapter 19.39, Division 4 (Appeals and Revocations) of this title. 
E.  Any use or activity not identified in Table 19.11.030A, or any use or activity not interpreted by the community development director, shall be prohibited.

19.47.050 - Frontage type standards. 
A.  This section provides frontage type standards for buildings in the HOO zone. Types of frontages include: 
1.  Live-Work/Office Fronts. A frontage that reinforces both residential and work activities that can occur in the building. The elevation of the ground floor is located at or near the grade of sidewalk to provide direct public access to the building. Entrances and windows are provided on the front of the facade to provide eyes on the street and direct sidewalk access to commercial and office uses. The front setback (if provided) may be improved with landscaping or as an extension of the public sidewalk to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment. 
a.  Elevation of Ground Floor. The ground floor elevation shall be located near the elevation of the sidewalk to minimize the need for external steps and external ADA ramps at public entrances. 
b.  Minimum Ground Floor Interior Height. Twelve feet minimum (floor-to-floor height-Commercial Ready). 
c.  Ground Floor Unit Entrances. All ground floor tenant spaces that have street frontage shall have entrances on a facade fronting a street. All other ground floor uses may have a common lobby entrance along the front facade or private entrances along other facades. 
d.  Upper Floor Unit Entrances. Entrances to upper floor units may be provided through a common lobby entrance and/or by a common entrance along a facade fronting a street. 
e.  Recessed Entrances. Entrances may be recessed into the facade. 
f.  Awnings and Marquees. Awnings or marquees may be provided over storefront windows and entrances. Awning and marquees may project up to six feet from the facade and extend over the sidewalk provided that at least eight feet of vertical clearance is provided. 
g.  Projecting Elements (Balconies, Roof Overhangs, Shade Structures, and Bay Windows). Projecting elements on upper floors may project four feet from the facade and project into the setback. 
h.  Sidewalk and Setback Treatment. The public sidewalk shall be improved with street trees with an average spacing of thirty feet on-center and pedestrian-scaled street lights (no taller than fourteen feet). If the front facade is setback from the public sidewalk, the setback shall be landscaped and/or improved as an extension of the public sidewalk. 
2.  Residential Fronts. A frontage that reinforces the residential character and use of the building. The elevation of the ground floor is elevated above the grade of the lot to provide privacy for residences by preventing direct views into the home from the sidewalk. Entrances and windows are provided on the front of the facade to provide eyes on the street and direct sidewalk access to the building. Stoops are allowed to project into the front setback to enhance entrances. The front setback is primarily improved with landscaping. 
a.  Elevation of Ground Floor. The ground floor elevation shall be located within six feet of the ground surface of the adjacent sidewalk or walkway.

g.  Projecting Elements (Balconies, Roof Overhangs, Shade Structures, and Bay Windows). Projecting elements on upper floors may project four feet from the facade and project into the setback. 
h.  Sidewalk and Setback Treatment. The public sidewalk shall be improved with street trees with an average spacing of thirty feet on-center and pedestrian-scaled street lights (no taller than fourteen feet). If the front facade is setback from the public sidewalk, the setback shall be landscaped (excluding stoops/front porches and paved paths to building entrances). 
3.  Storefronts. A frontage that reinforces the commercial character and use of the ground floor of the building. The elevation of the ground floor is located at or near the grade of sidewalk to provide direct public access into the building. Large storefronts display windows are provided on the front of the facade to encourage visual access to merchandise displays and to encourage window shopping. Awnings or marquees are provided over storefront windows and entrances. The front setback (if provided) is primarily improved as an extension of the public sidewalk to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment. 
a.  Elevation of Ground Floor. The ground floor elevation shall be located near the elevation of the sidewalk to minimize the need for external steps and external ADA ramps at public entrances. 
b.  Minimum Ground Floor Ceiling Height. Fifteen feet minimum (floor-to-floor height). 
c.  Storefront Entrances. All ground floor tenant spaces that have street frontage shall have storefront entrances on the facade fronting a street.

19.47.060 - Open space standards. 
    This section provides open space standards for development within the HOO zone. 
A.  Usable Open Space Defined. Usable open space areas are an open area or an indoor or outdoor recreational facility which is designed and intended to be used for outdoor living and/or recreation. Usable open space shall not include any portion of parking areas, streets, driveways, sidewalks, or turnaround areas. 
B.  The following standards shall apply to the requirements for open space: 
1.  Private Residential Open Space. 
a.  For stand-alone multi-family residential projects or as part of a mixed-use development, each residential unit shall be provided with at least one area of private open space accessible directly from the living area of the unit, in the form of a fenced yard or patio, a deck or balcony at a minimum area of one hundred fifty square feet per unit for first floor units and one hundred square feet per unit for upper floors. 
b.  The minimum dimension, width or depth, of a balcony shall be five feet. 
2.  Common Residential Open Space. 
a.  For stand-alone multi-family residential developments, each residential unit shall be provided with at least two hundred square feet of common residential open space. 
b.  All common open space shall be conveniently located and accessible to all dwelling units on the site. 
c.  Common open space areas may include landscaping, pedestrian paths, and recreational facilities. 
d.  In projects containing fewer than ten units, the common open space shall have a minimum width and depth of ten feet. In projects containing ten or more units, the minimum width and depth shall be twenty feet. 
3.  Recreational Amenities/Facilities. 
a.  For projects containing twenty-five or more residential units in stand-alone multi-family residential developments and as part of a mixed-use development, one common recreational amenity shall be provided for each thirty units or fraction thereof. The following listed amenities satisfy the above recreational facilities requirements. Recognizing that certain facilities serve more people than others, have a wider interest or appeal, and/or occupy more area, specified items may be counted as two amenities, as noted. In all cases, each square foot of land area devoted to a recreational amenity shall be credited as common open space on a 1:1 basis. 
i.  Clubhouse (two); 
ii.  Swimming pool (two); 
iii.  Tennis court (one per court); 
iv.  Basketball court (one per court); 
v.  Racquetball court (one per court); 
vi.  Weightlifting facility; 
vii.  Children's playground equipment; 
viii.  Sauna; 
ix.  Jacuzzi; 
x.  Day care facility (two); 
xi.  Other recreational amenities deemed adequate by the community development director. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-19-2013) 
19.47.070 - Public space amenities requirements. 
A.  Each project proposed within the HOO zone must include a public open space amenity, or some form of physical interface for the pedestrian. Such features may include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Formal Plazas. A formal plaza would be a publicly accessible open space which has a design that is influenced by classical urban planning design. A formal plaza would typically include some sort of central water fountain and/or symmetrical landscaping. 
2.  Urban Gardens. An urban garden can be located on the ground level, or on upper levels of a structure. Urban gardens include ornamental landscaping arranged in raised or at-grade planters or planting areas, potted plants and trees. Many times there are sculptures or other forms of public art that are included within the urban garden. 
3.  Covered Colonnades. Colonnades are linear in design and generous in depth. The intent is to provide a comfortably wide, covered pathway that is adjacent to the openings of a building. Sometimes the second floor of a building is utilized to create the "covered" element of the colonnade. 
4.  Sidewalk Dining. Sidewalk dining may occur wherever a sidewalk space is ample enough to accommodate dining furniture without impeding pedestrian access of the sidewalk. Sidewalk dining may be defined with a railing or planters, or be open and accessible. 
5.  Pedestrian Alleys and Walkways. A pedestrian alley or walkway is typically a "lane" that does not follow the alignment of a vehicular street, but provides a pedestrian access to either a public space or some other feature within the interior of a development. Pedestrian alleys or walkways must be designed in such a manner so as to be inviting to pedestrians. Therefore, issues such as lighting, security, line of sight, cleanliness and visual appeal are important considerations to a well designed pedestrian alley or walkway. Sometimes public art, street furniture and access to shops and public spaces are features of pedestrian alleys and walkways.

3.  Noise Notification. 
a.  Residents, whether owners or tenants, of a mixed-use development project shall be notified in writing before taking up residence that they will be living in an urban type of environment and that the noise levels may be higher than a typical residential area. 
b.  The covenants, conditions, and restrictions of a mixed-use project shall require that the residents acknowledge their receipt of the written noise notification. Their signatures shall confirm receipt and understanding of this information 
B.  Fences and Walls. In addition to the regulations in Section 19.09.060 (Fences, hedges, and walls, commercial zone), fences and walls shall be subject to the following regulations: 
1.  Separation Wall Required. A masonry separation wall shall be constructed on all property lines adjacent to any single-family residential district. Pedestrian access points are encouraged and may be allowed subject to approval of the director. The separation wall shall be six feet in height, as measured from the highest elevation of land contiguous to the wall, except in a required front setback area and in a required exterior side setback area for a corner, reverse corner or key lot, where the wall shall be limited to thirty-six inches in height. 
2.  Other Fences and Walls. Fences and walls are allowed in any yard area subject to the following height regulations: 
a.  Front Yard Area. In the front yard area, the height shall be limited to thirty-six inches. 
b.  Street Side Yard. In street side yard areas, the height shall be limited to thirty-six inches.

3.  Location. All perimeter fences and walls shall be constructed on the property line unless a different location is permitted by the community development director. No parallel wall or fence shall be constructed less than five feet from an existing wall or fence, unless approved by the community development director. 
4.  Materials. 
a.  Chain link fencing shall not be erected between a primary or accessory structure and a public or private street, except that chain link fencing may be used for security purposes for public utility structures and for temporary fencing needs (construction sites, special events, vacant lots, etc.). 
b.  Barbed wire and concertina wire are prohibited, except at public utility structures. 
C.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall comply with Chapter 19.23 (Landscaping). 
D.  Screening and Buffering-Mechanical Equipment and Trash Facilities. Mechanical and air-conditioning equipment shall be screened and buffered in compliance with Section 19.19.100 (Mechanical equipment screening) and trash facilities shall be screened and buffered in compliance with Section 19.19.140 (Solid waste receptacles and enclosures). 
E.  Signs. Signs shall comply with Chapter 19.25 (Signs). In addition, in the HOO zone where both residential and nonresidential uses are allowed, the signage rights and responsibilities applicable to a particular use shall be determined as follows: residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in the residential area where that type of use would be allowed as a matter of right, and nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in a zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a discretionary process. 
F.  Sound Mitigation. Residential dwelling units shall be designed to be sound attenuated against present and future project noise. New projects or new nonresidential uses in existing projects shall provide an acoustical analysis report, by an acoustical engineer, describing the acoustical design features of the structure required to satisfy the exterior and interior noise standards. 
G.  Design Criteria. 
1.  A mixed-use development project shall be designed and constructed to: 
a.  Be pedestrian in its focus by: 
i.  Providing direct pedestrian linkages to adjacent public sidewalks. 
ii.  Creating enhanced pedestrian connections throughout the project between residential and nonresidential uses and parking areas. 
iii.  Providing enhanced pedestrian amenities throughout the project, including seating, pedestrian area lighting, special paving, public art, water features, common open space, directories, and similar items to create a pleasant pedestrian experience. 
b.  Incorporating architectural design elements and materials that relate to a pedestrian scale. 
c.  Locate uses in proximity to one another without large intervening parking lots so that it is convenient for people to walk between the various uses and park their vehicles only once. 
d.  Create a pedestrian scale and character of development along the street by providing significant wall articulation and varying roof heights, incorporating pedestrian scale elements (e.g., doors, windows, lighting, landscaping), and locating storefronts and common open space areas (e.g., plaza, courtyard, outdoor dining) near the public sidewalk to contribute to an active street environment. 
2.  Consistent Use of Architectural Details and Materials. Architectural style and use of quality materials shall be compatible and consistent throughout an entire mixed-use project. However, differences in architectural details and materials may occur to differentiate between the residential and nonresidential portions of the project. The overall project design and site layout shall be one that promotes a strong pedestrian environment and active street frontage. This can be accomplished by incorporating features into the project as outlined in subsection (3) below. 
3.  Features. 
a.  Street Level Features. Variations in the front building plane shall be incorporated through the use of varying building setbacks, variations in wall planes, and the inclusion of pedestrian amenities (e.g., plaza, courtyard, outdoor dining, landscaping). Long expanses of blank walls shall be prohibited. 
b.  Pedestrian-Oriented Features. At least seventy-five percent of the building frontage facing a public street, primary pedestrian way, or parking lot shall be devoted to pedestrian-oriented features (e.g., storefronts, pedestrian entrances to nonresidential uses; transparent display windows; landscaping). 
c.  Upper Level Features. Upper floor balconies, bays, and windows shall be provided whenever opportunities exist for these types of features. 
d.  Entrances. When nonresidential and residential uses are located in a vertical mixed use structure, separate pedestrian entrances shall be provided for each use. The entrances for nonresidential uses shall be designed to be visually distinct from the entrances for residential uses. Entrances to individual residential units in a vertical mixed use project shall not be allowed along a street frontage. Instead shared entrances to residential units located above the ground floor shall be from lobbies that serve multiple units. 
e.  Neighborhood Interface. The design of new infill development shall be sensitive to the scale and design characteristics of established structures in abutting residential neighborhoods, with the objective of achieving a harmonious transition between the new development and existing neighborhood. Consideration shall be given to factors including, but not limited to, orientation of architectural features, building articulation, and exterior building treatments. 
f.  Lighting. Lighting shall be incorporated along sidewalks or other pedestrian walkways, plazas, paseos, courtyards, and other common open areas to enhance the pedestrian environment and increase public safety. Lighting for nonresidential uses shall be designed, located, and shielded to ensure that they do not adversely impact the residential uses, but shall provide sufficient illumination for access and security purposes consistent with the provisions of Section 19.19.130 (Lighting). 
g.  Security. Projects shall be designed to minimize security risks to residents and to minimize the opportunities for vandalism and theft. This may be accomplished by: 
i.  Maximizing visibility to common open space areas, internal walkways, and public sidewalks. Use opportunities for natural surveillance to increase visibility. 
ii.  Using walkways, low fences, lighting, signage, and landscaping to clearly guide people and vehicles to and from the proper entrances. 
iii.  Eliminating areas of concealment, hiding places, and dead spaces. 
iv.  Using lighting to improve the visibility of common areas while enhancing the pedestrian environment. Lighting should not be overly bright and should provide a uniform level of light over the subject area to eliminate dark spaces. 
(Ord. No. 656, § 4 (Exh. A), 11-19-2013) 
19.47.100 - Outdoor dining.

B.  Private Property. Outdoor dining on private property shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Coordinated Design Scheme. The design and appearance of proposed improvements or furniture (e.g., tables, chairs, benches, umbrellas, planters, menu boards, etc.) to be placed in an outdoor dining area shall present a coordinated theme and shall be compatible with the appearance and design of the primary structure, as determined by the director. 
2.  Hours of Operation. Hours of operation for outdoor dining areas shall coincide with those of the associated indoor restaurant. 
3.  Property Maintenance. The operator shall maintain the outdoor dining area(s) in a neat, clean, and orderly condition at all times. This shall include all tables, benches, chairs, displays, or other related furniture. An adequate number of trash receptacles shall be provided to serve the outdoor dining area. 
4.  Outdoor Bar Prohibited. A bar designed and/or operated to sell or dispense any alcoholic beverages shall not be allowed in the outside dining area. 
5.  Location. Outdoor dining areas may be allowed to locate in required setback areas but shall not encroach into required parking areas. They may be allowed to encroach into a public right-of-way with an approved encroachment permit issued by the city engineer. 
6.  Noise. Amplified sound (e.g., music, television, etc.) shall not be audible beyond the lot line. 
C.  Review Criteria. When reviewing an application to allow outdoor dining, the review authority shall consider the relation of outdoor dining areas to sensitive noise receptors (e.g., hospitals, schools, and residential uses). Mitigation measures shall be applied to eliminate potential impacts related to glare, light, loitering, and noise.

The sign program shall identify the location for all signage that may be located on the building, the allowable sign materials, lighting methods and sign design. In addition, temporary signs and banners will be included in the sign program, as to whether or not they are allowed, and if they are allowed, then where these signs may be located within the development project. At no time, shall the sign program allow for signage in excess of those standards within Chapter 19.25 (Signs). "Box" signs, "canister" or "can" signs are prohibited. 
B.  Pedestrian-oriented, non-illuminated hanging "blade" signs that either hang under a colonnade or canopy, or project from the facade of a building, shall not be counted within the sign area formula that is used to calculate the maximum amount of sign area for each building. In other words, the hanging or projecting blade sign is a "free" sign in regards to being included in calculating the maximum amount of sign area that a development or store may have. In no case shall a pedestrian-oriented, non-illuminated hanging or projecting blade sign exceed two square feet maximum per sign face, or two square feet for a double-faced blade sign.

APPENDIX B - HANDICAPPED PARKING STANDARDS 
  
EXCERPT FROM TITLE 24, 
CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS 
ACCESSIBLE PARKING 
    Section 3107A. (a) Accessible Parking Required. 1. General. Each lot or parking structure where parking is provided for the public as clients, guests or employees, shall provide accessible parking as required by this section. Accessible parking spaces serving a particular building shall be located on the shortest accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an accessible entrance. In parking facilities that do not serve a particular building, accessible parking shall be located on the shortest accessible route of travel to an accessible pedestrian entrance of the parking facility. In buildings with multiple accessible entrances with adjacent parking, accessible parking spaces shall be dispersed and located closest to the accessible entrances. Table No. 3lA establishes the number of accessible parking spaces required. 
EXCEPTION: This subsection shall not apply to existing facilities where compliance with local ordinances precludes satisfying the above requirements or of providing equivalent facilitation unless a change of occupancy occurs. 
    3107A (a) 2. Less than five spaces. When less than five parking spaces are provided at buildings and facilities subject to these regulations, one shall be 14 feet wide and lined to provide a 9-foot parking area and a 5-foot loading and unloading area. However, there is no requirement that the space be reserved exclusively or identified for use by persons with disabilities only. 
    3107A (a) 3. Medical care outpatient facilities. At facilities providing medical care and other services for persons with mobility impairments, parking spaces complying with this section shall be provided in accordance with Table No. 3lA except as follows: 
A.  Outpatient units and facilities: 10 percent of the total number of parking spaces provided serving each such outpatient unit or facility; 
B.  Units and facilities that specialize in treatment or services for persons with mobility impairments: 20 percent of the total number of parking spaces provided serving each such unit or facility. 
    3107A (b). Parking Space Size. Accessible parking spaces shall be located as near as practical to a primary entrance and shall be sized as follows: 
1.  Where single spaces are provided, they shall be 14 feet wide and outlined to provide a 9-foot parking area and a 5-foot loading and unloading access aisle on the passenger side of the vehicle. When more than one space is provided in lieu of providing a 14-foot-wide space for each parking space, two spaces can be provided within a 23-foot-wide area lined to provide a 9-foot parking area on each side of a 5-foot loading and unloading access aisle in the center. The minimum length of each parking space shall be 18 feet. See Figure No. 31-18A. 
2.  One in every eight accessible spaces, but not less than one, shall be served by an access aisle 96 inches wide minimum and shall be designated van accessible as required by Section 3107A (c). All such spaces may be grouped on one level of a parking structure. 
3.  Arrangement of parking space. In each parking area, a bumper or curb shall be provided and located to prevent encroachment of cars over the required width of walkways. Also, the space shall be so located that persons with disabilities are not compelled to wheel or walk behind parked cars other than their own. Pedestrian ways which are accessible to people with disabilities shall be provided from each such parking space to related facilities, including curb cuts or ramps as needed. Ramps shall not encroach into any parking space. 
EXCEPTIONS: 1. Ramps located at the front of accessible parking spaces may encroach into the length of such spaces when such encroachment does not limit the capability of a person with a disability to leave or enter their vehicle, thus providing equivalent facilitation. See Figures 31-18A through C. 
2.  Where the enforcing agency determines that compliance with any regulation of this subsection would create an unreasonable hardship, a variance or waiver may be granted when equivalent facilitation is provided. 
3.  Parking spaces may be provided which would require a person with a disability to wheel or walk behind other than accessible parking spaces when the enforcing agency determines that compliance with these regulations or providing equivalent facilitation would create an unreasonable hardship. 
NOTE: See Section 110 10D. 
4.  Slope of parking space. Surface slopes of accessible parking spaces shall be the minimum possible and shall not exceed 1/4 inch per foot (2.083 percent gradient) in any direction. 
    3107A (c) Identification of Parking Spaces for Off-Street Parking Facilities. Each parking space reserved for persons with physical disabilities shall be identified by a reflectorized sign permanently posted immediately adjacent to and visible from each stall or space, consisting of a profile view of a wheelchair with occupant in white on dark blue background. The sign shall not be smaller than 70 square inches in area and, when in a path of travel, shall be posted at a minimum height of 80 inches from the bottom of the sign to the parking space finished grade. Signs may also be centered on the wall at the interior end of the parking space at a minimum height of 36 inches from the parking space finished grade, ground or sidewalk. Spaces complying with Section 3107A (b) 2 shall have an additional sign stating "Van-Accessible" mounted below the symbol of accessibility. 
    An additional sign shall also be posted in a conspicuous place at each entrance to off-street parking facilities, or immediately adjacent to and visible from each stall or space. The sign shall not be less than 17 inches by 22 inches in size with lettering not less than 1 inch in height, which clearly and conspicuously states the following: 
    "Unauthorized vehicles parked in designated accessible spaces not displaying distinguishing placards or license plates issued for persons with disabilities may be towed away at owner's expense. Towed vehicles may be reclaimed at ____________ or by telephoning ____________ ." 
    Blank spaces are to be filled in with appropriate information as a permanent part of the sign. 
In addition to the above requirements, the surface of each accessible parking space or stall shall have a surface identification duplicating either of the following schemes: 
1.  By outlining or painting the stall or space in blue and outlining on the ground in the stall or space in white or suitable contrasting color a profile view depicting a wheelchair with occupant; or 
2.  By outlining a profile view of a wheelchair with occupant in white on blue background. The profile view shall be located so that it is visible to a traffic enforcement officer when a vehicle is properly parked in the space and shall be 36 inches high by 36 inches wide. See Figures Nos. 3l-18A through C. 
    3107A (d) Parking Structures. All entrances to and vertical clearances within parking structures shall have a minimum vertical clearance of 8 feet 2 inches where required for accessibility to accessible parking spaces. 
EXCEPTIONS: 1. Where the enforcing agency determines that compliance with Section 3107A (d) would create an unreasonable hardship, an exception may be granted when equivalent facilitation is provided. 
2.  This section shall not apply to existing buildings where the enforcing agency determines that, due to legal or physical constraints, compliance with these regulations or equivalent facilitation would create an unreasonable hardship. See Section 110 10D. 
Passenger Drop-off and Loading Zones 
    Section 3108A. (a) Location. When provided, passenger drop-off and loading zones shall be located on accessible route of travel. 
    Section 3108A (b) Passenger Loading Zones. 1. General. Where provided, one passenger drop-off and loading zone shall provide an access aisle at least 60 inches wide and 20 feet long adjacent and parallel to the vehicle pull-up space. Such zones shall be located on a surface with a slope not exceeding 1 vertical in 50 horizontal. If there are curbs between the access aisle and the vehicle pull-up space, a curb ramp shall be provided. 
    3108A (c). Valet Parking. Valet parking facilities shall provide a passenger loading zone complying with Subsection (b) above and shall be located on an accessible route to the entrance of the facility. The parking space requirements of Section 3107A apply to facilities with valet parking. 
TABLE NO. 31A - SPACES REQUIRED 
The following table establishes the number of accessible parking space required: 
Total Number of Parking Spaces in Lot or Garage Minimum Required Number of Spaces 1-25 1 26-50 2 51-75 3 76-100 4 101-150 5 151-200 6 201-300 7 301-400 8 401-500 9 500-1,000 2% of total 1,000 or more 20 plus 1/1000 or fraction thereof
