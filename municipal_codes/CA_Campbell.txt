CAMPBELL MUNICIPAL CODE 1971 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Campbell, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 12, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Campbell Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1972, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Robert Dempster, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 12, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2233, passed May 15, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 12, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 12, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission.

We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Sections: 

3.34.010 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter. 
(1)  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
(2)  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
(3)  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sub-lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
(4)  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
(5)  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
(6)  "Tax administrator" means the director of finance. 
(7)  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired. After the expiration of the thirty-day period, such person shall prospectively cease to be a transient during any additional consecutive calendar days of such person's occupancy, but such person shall still be considered a transient as to the first thirty days of such person's occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. 
(Ord. 2033 § 1, 2003; Ord. 920 (part), 1973). 
3.34.020 - Tax imposed. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 1920 § 1, 1995: Ord. 1619 § 1(part), 1986; Ord. 1561(part), 1985: Ord. 920(part), 1973).

The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 920(part), 1973). 
3.34.050 - Registration. 
    Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
(1)  The name of the operator; 
(2)  The address of the hotel; 
(3)  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
(4)  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator.

As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If the application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.34.090.

The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 920(part), 1973). 
3.34.100 - Records. 
    It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

3.34.110 - Refunds.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
(b)  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(c)  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided by subsection (a) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(d)  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 920 (part), 1973). 
3.34.120 - Actions to collect. 
    Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city.

Editor's note- It should be noted that Ord. No. 2132, § 1, adopted August 1, 2010, effective July 1, 2011, provides, "This ordinance makes changes in various business license tax rates, as well as consolidating various classifications of businesses. Where a reference to a certain type or classification of business is deleted from the Municipal Code, it is the intention of this ordinance that the deleted type or classification of business will be taxed as provided for in the more general classification into which that type or classification of business falls under Campbell Municipal Code Section 5.04.010, unless some other more specific provision applies. For example, kennels, animal hospitals, bowling alleys, skating rinks, riding academies, shoe shines and auction galleries with fixed location in the City shall be subject to the rates for commercial businesses; veterinarians would be subject to the rates set forth for professional businesses; scavenger businesses, junk dealers and junk collectors would be subject to the rates set forth for industrial businesses; and businesses with no fixed place of business within the City that use a motor vehicle in the conduct of his business in the City, and auctions conducted by businesses that have their offices located outside the City shall be subject to the rate for out of town businesses. The deletion of a certain type or classification of business shall not be interpreted to mean that the business is exempt from payment of a business license tax."

(c)  A franchise does not relieve a franchisee of its duty to comply with city's municipal code, all city ordinances, resolutions, written policies, and regulations, and every franchisee must comply with the same. The rights granted under a franchise ordinance are subject to the exercise of police and other powers city now has or may later obtain, including but not limited to the power of eminent domain. The terms of every franchise granted shall be subordinate to all the requirements of the Campbell Municipal Code. 
(d)  A franchise does not convey title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way or public property.

(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.360 - Franchise non-exclusive.

    Every franchise shall be deemed to be held in trust, and to be personal to the franchisee. Any transfer that is made without the prior approval of city shall be deemed to impair that trust. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer. 
(b)  Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise ordinance, a change of control of a franchise, occurs whenever there is a change in actual working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a franchisee or its direct or indirect parents. Without limiting the above, if a franchisee is organized as a partnership, the substitution of a general partner of a franchisee will be presumed a change in control. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable communications system to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be made without application and without city's prior consent. However, no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect under any condition: (1) prevent the cable communications system operator or any successor from complying with, this chapter, the franchise ordinance or other applicable law or regulation; or (2) permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the system, without the prior consent of city.

(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.420 - General conditions upon construction, operation and repair. 
(a)  The construction, operation, and repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and generally applicable exercises of the city's police powers. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes Title 21 of the Campbell Municipal Code (i.e., the city's zoning ordinance), the city of Campbell standard specifications and details for public works construction, IEEE standards, the National Electronic Code, and the National Electrical Safety Code. City shall have the right to restrict construction, operation, maintenance and/or repair of a cable communications system or of any of franchisee's facilities located in the public rights-of-way to certain specific days and hours as determined by city. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of cable communications systems shall exercise reasonable care within the meaning of applicable law in the performance of all their activities, and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and/or devices to reduce the likelihood of damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property. 
(b)  A franchise is required before a permit may be issued for work associated with the construction, operation or repair of a cable communications system. Any permit issued for such work to a person that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee; the permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all facilities installed under the permit upon and in full compliance with city's demand. 
(c)  Construction, operation, or repair of a cable communications system shall not commence until all required permits have been obtained from the proper city officials and all required fees have been paid. A franchisee shall reimburse city for all costs associated with the review and inspection of the franchisee's design and construction proposals. Such costs shall include but are not limited to administrative and engineering review, clerical costs, inspection costs during construction, and other related costs. All work performed will be performed in strict accordance with the conditions of the permit. Upon order of city, any work and/or construction undertaken that is not completed in compliance with city's requirements, or which is installed without obtaining necessary permits and approvals shall be removed in accordance with the reasonable timeline set forth by city. A franchisee shall reimburse the city for costs incurred in inspecting construction undertaken in the course of major upgrades and/or installation of fiber optics. 
(d)  Not less than seven days prior to beginning construction or installation that involves excavation, obstruction of or interference with a public right-of-way, or which otherwise causes disruption or a nuisance to the immediate vicinity, a franchisee shall provide written notice to all residences and businesses that are located within a node radius of the site of such construction or installation. The notice shall describe the nature of the construction or installation, the estimated time the project shall take, and the days and hours when construction and installation shall occur. The notice shall also provide an address and telephone number for the recipient to contact if they desire more information about the construction or installation project. 
(e)  Interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing cable communications systems, must be minimized. City may require a person using the public rights-of-way to cooperate with others through joint trenching and other arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way. Franchisee shall be required, upon notice, to send a representative to all utility coordination meetings held by city and shall agree to honor city's five-year "no cut" policy for overlaid and reconstructed streets. 
(f)  To the extent possible, operators of cable communications systems shall use existing poles and conduit. Additional poles may not be installed in the right-of-way, nor may pole capacity be increased by vertical or horizontal extenders, without the permission of the city engineer. 
(g)  (1)  Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in an area in city, every cable communications system operator installing its system in the same area must locate its cable communications system facilities underground. 
(2)  Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground within an area of city, every cable communications system operator in the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground. 
(3)  The city engineer may exempt a particular cable communications system or facility or group of cable communications systems or facilities from the obligation to locate or relocate the cable communications system or facility underground, where relocation is impractical, or where the interest in protecting against visual blight can be protected in another manner. Nothing in this section prevents city from ordering cable communications system facilities to be located or relocated underground under other provisions of the municipal code. 
(h)  An operator shall repair any disturbance or damage to public property, or private property caused by the operator's construction, operation or repair of a cable communications system. Public property and public rights-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of city or to a condition as good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred. 
(i)  (1)  Except as otherwise provided in a franchise ordinance, a franchisee will protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property at the time and in the manner required by the city or any other governmental entity by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, freeway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and tracks or any other type of structures or improvements of public agencies. Except in an emergency, the city shall provide written notice describing where the work is to be performed at least two weeks before the deadline for performing the work; a franchisee may seek an extension of the time to perform the work where it cannot be performed by the deadline even with the exercise of due diligence, and such request for an extension will not be unreasonably refused. 
(2)  If a franchisee receives notice hereunder and does not receive an extension, and the franchisee fails to take necessary action to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove its property as required by city, then city may take whatever steps it deems necessary to protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove the franchisee's property and the franchisee shall be required to reimburse city upon written demand for the cost incurred in taking such action. If a franchisee fails to pay city the amount of these costs within thirty days of receiving such written demand, provided franchisee has not exercised any rights it may have to lawfully challenge the costs, city shall be entitled to collect these costs from any security fund provided pursuant to the franchisee's franchise. 
(j)  (1)  If any removal, relaying or relocation is required to accommodate the construction, operation or repair of the facilities of another person authorized to use public rights-of-way, franchisee will, after fifteen days' advance written notice, use reasonably good faith efforts to effect the necessary changes requested by such person. Unless the matter is governed by state law, or unless the franchisee's cable system was improperly installed and if installed properly, the removal, relocation or relaying would be unnecessary, the reasonable expense associated with such removal, relaying, or relocation will be borne by the person requesting the removal, relaying, or relocation. The city may direct franchisee to remove, relay, or relocate its facilities pending resolution of a dispute as to responsibility for costs upon posting of a bond by the person requesting such removal, relaying or relocation in the amount of franchisee's estimated costs, and upon agreement by the requesting party to cover any reasonable expenses of franchisee related thereto. 
(2)  A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid building moving permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires by a reasonable time specified to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. A cable communications system operator shall be given not less than seven days advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same. 
(k)  (1)  In the event of a relocation for the government pursuant to Section 420I1, a franchisee may abandon any property in place in the public rights-of-way or upon public property upon written notice to city. However, if the city determines, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion exercised, within ninety days of the date the required written notices are received, that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public right-of-way or public property and facilities in the public right-of-way or on public property will be adversely affected, the property must be removed by a date specified by city. In the event that a franchisee does not remove such property by the date specified by city, city may remove the property without any further notice and the franchisee shall be required to reimburse city for the removal cost. 
(2)  A franchisee that abandons its property must, upon request, transfer ownership of the property to city at no cost, and execute necessary quitclaim deeds; whether or not ownership is transferred, the franchisee must indemnify city against future costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any hazard associated with the abandoned property. 
(l)  The city may inspect and conduct reasonable tests of the cable system upon receipt of reasonable evidence of failure to meet applicable technical performance obligations, and to ensure compliance with the cable ordinance, this franchise, and applicable provisions of local, state and federal law. 
(m)  Each franchisee that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The franchisee shall locate its facilities for city at no charge. 
(n)  At least sixty days prior to commencing construction, each cable communications system franchisee shall provide city a plan for any initial cable communications system construction, operation or repair or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its cable communications system, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of city that will be affected. 
(o)  A franchisee shall use reasonable efforts to provide interconnections with all other cable systems and open video systems in the city, for the purpose of sharing institutional network and PEG access communications across networks, provided franchisee is able to reach agreement with the other operator for the interconnection on reasonable terms and conditions and the city obtains any necessary consent from the adjacent cable system's franchising authority. 
(p)  A franchisee shall provide free and useable access to its poles and conduits to the city and for PEG access provided that any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the franchisee associated therewith shall be borne by city and such use does not hinder the operations of the franchisee, is used for solely governmental purposes, and is not used to compete against the franchisee in any manner. 
(q)  Franchisee shall notify the city if another party occupies franchisee's poles or conduit within the city and will identify the identity of occupant and the location of occupant's facilities in or on such poles or conduit. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.430 - Protection of city and residents. 
(a)  Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise ordinance, each franchise shall include an indemnity that must, to the extent permitted by law: 
(1)  Release city and the redevelopment agency from and against any and all liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation, repair or maintenance of the cable communications system. Each cable communications system operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from city or the redevelopment agency in connection with the above mentioned matters; and 
(2)  Indemnify, save and hold harmless, and faithfully defend the city, the redevelopment agency and each of their officers, commissions, commissioners, boards and employees, from and against any liability for damages resulting from, and for claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments arising from: (i) property damage; (ii) bodily injury (including accidental death); (iii) invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation; and (iv) violation or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark, or patent, or of any other right of any person, firm, or corporation, including a failure by the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or licensees of programs to be delivered by the cable system; which arise out of the franchisee's construction, operation, or maintenance of its cable system, provided that the city shall give franchisee written notice of its obligation to indemnify the city within fifteen days of receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, franchisee shall not indemnify the city for any damages, liability or claims resulting from the willful misconduct or sole negligence of the city. 
(b)  A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall not commence construction or operation of the cable communications system without first obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type specified in the franchise ordinance. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way or on public property. If the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, city may order such persons to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 
(c)  Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise ordinance, certificates of insurance, reflecting evidence of the required insurance and naming city and the redevelopment agency as additional insureds, shall be filed with city clerk. For persons issued franchises after the effective date of this chapter, certificates shall be filed within thirty days of the issuance of a franchise, once a year thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage. For persons that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this chapter, the certificate shall be filed within thirty days of the effective date of this chapter, annually thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise ordinance expressly provides for filing of certificates in a different manner. Each franchisee's insurance coverage shall be primary insurance as respects the city. Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the city shall be excess of the franchisee's insurance and shall not contribute with it. 
(d)  Unless otherwise agreed to in a franchise ordinance, certificates shall contain a provision that coverage afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least sixty days' prior written notice has been given to city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state of California. Financial ratings shall be no less than "A" in the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide," published by A.M. Best Guide. Upon request, franchisee shall provide city clerk with written proof of such financial ratings. 
(e)  A cable communications system operator shall maintain the following minimum insurance. City and the redevelopment agency shall be named as an additional insured on the general liability and automotive policies; those insurance policies shall be primary and contain a cross-liability clause. 
(1)  Comprehensive general liability insurance to cover liability from bodily injury and property damage. Exposures to be covered shall include: premises, operations, products/completed operations, and certain contracts. Coverage must be written on an occurrence basis, with the following minimum limits of liability: 
(2)  Minimum limits of liability:

    Completed operations and products liability shall be maintained for two years after the termination of the franchise or license (in the case of the cable communications system owner or operator) or completion of the work for the cable communications system owner or operator (in the case of a contractor or subcontractor). 
    Property damage liability insurance shall include coverage for the following hazards: X - explosion, C - Collapse, U - underground. 
(3)  Workers' compensation insurance shall be maintained during the life of the franchise to comply with statutory limits for all employees, and in the case any work is sublet, each cable communications system operator shall require the subcontractors similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all the latter's employees unless such employees are covered by the protection afforded by each cable communications system operator. Each cable communications system operator and its contractors and subcontractors shall maintain during the life of this policy employers liability insurance. The following minimum limits must be maintained: 
Workers' Compensation Statutory Employer's Liability $ 1,000,000.00 per occurrence

(5)  Broadcaster's liability coverage, in amounts specified in a franchise ordinance, if an operator of a cable communications system will be producing or originating programming. 
(f)  Every franchisee shall obtain and maintain a performance bond to ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and any franchise ordinance. In the case of any franchise ordinance that requires a franchisee to initially build, or to upgrade a system, the amount of the bond shall be in an amount sufficient to ensure that the required construction is satisfactorily completed. The amount of the bond may be reduced upon successful completion of the required construction. The amount of the performance bonds shall be set by the city manager or may be set in a franchise ordinance in light of the nature of the work to be performed pursuant to or under the franchise. The bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required through any permitting process. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. However, any performance bond issued hereunder must be issued by a surety with an A-1 rating or better rating of insurance in the latest edition of Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casual Edition. Bonds must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise ordinance specifically provides otherwise. 
(g)  Every franchisee shall establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide city an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount specified in the franchise ordinance but no less than one hundred thousand dollars to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise ordinance, and to pay any taxes, fees or liens owed to city. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to city's director of finance and in a form acceptable to the city attorney. Should city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the franchisee shall, within fourteen days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by city for a franchisee where city determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee's operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise ordinance specifically provides otherwise. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.440 - Enforcement and remedies. 
(a)  The city council may revoke a franchise if it finds, after a hearing, that a franchise has committed a material violation of any provision of this chapter, committed a material breach of its franchise ordinance or repeatedly failed to comply with its franchise ordinance; has defrauded or attempted to defraud city or subscribers; or has attempted to evade the requirements of this chapter or its franchise ordinance. Before conducting a hearing to revoke the franchise: (1) the city manager must have given notice of a claimed violation, breach, default or failure; and (2) the franchisee must have been given thirty days to: (a) cure the claimed default; or (b) in the event that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the thirty day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default and notify the city of the steps being taken and the projected date that they will be completed. If the franchisee challenges the assertion of violation, the franchisee shall have ten days from receipt of notice to respond to city challenging the assertion of violation, by providing evidence that there is no violation. If city rejects franchisee's challenge, franchisee will be notified of the rejection and start of the thirty-day cure period. The franchisee will be given at least thirty days notice of the hearing date, and will be provided an opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The city council will consider evidence and testimony and render findings and its decision no more than ninety days following conclusion of the hearing. Any revocation proceeding must be conducted in accordance with then applicable federal and state law, if any. 
(b)  City may declare a franchise forfeited without opportunity to cure where a franchisee voluntarily stops providing service it is required to provide. 
(c)  To the extent not prohibited by the United States Bankruptcy Code, a franchise will terminate automatically by force of law one hundred eighty calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. However, the franchise may be reinstated within that one hundred eighty day period, if: (1) such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or (2) such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise ordinance, and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise ordinance. To the extent not prohibited by the United States Bankruptcy Code, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of substantially all of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, city may revoke the franchise following a public hearing before the city council, by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges thereunder will be revoked and will terminate thirty calendar days after serving such notice, unless: (1) city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and (2) the successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise ordinance and this chapter. 
(d)  Upon termination or forfeiture of a franchise, whether by action of the city as provided above, or by passage of time, city may do one or a combination of the following. 
(1)  The city may require the former franchisee to remove all or a portion of its facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, city may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense, subject to any right of abandonment provided for under applicable law. 
(2)  The city, by resolution of the city council, may acquire ownership or effect a transfer of all or a portion of the cable communications system at fair market value, or, if the franchise terminates or is revoked for cause, an equitable price. The terms "equitable price" and fair market value shall be interpreted in accordance with 47 U.S.C. § 547. 
(3)  Subsection (d)(3) of this section does not apply to an abandonment. If a cable communications system or any part thereof is abandoned by franchisee, city may require the franchisee to transfer title to all or some of the abandoned portions to it at no charge, free and clear of encumbrances, and the same will become city's property and city may keep, sell, assign, or transfer all or part of the assets of the cable communications system, or otherwise dispose of those assets as it sees fit. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, city may not, pursuant to this section, issue an order that violates 47 U.S.C. § 541(b)(3)(c). 
(e)  Remedies provided for under this chapter, or under a franchise ordinance shall be cumulative and are in addition to all other remedies which may be available at law or equity. Recovery by city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify city; or relieve a franchisee of its franchise obligations or limit the amounts owed to city. 
(f)  Each franchise shall contain a provision specifying liquidated damages payable to city in the event of a breach of a franchise obligation where damages would otherwise be difficult to ascertain. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.450 - Books and records. 
(a)  The city shall, upon thirty days' written notice to a franchisee, have the right to inspect and copy books and records that are related in whole or in part to the construction, operation or repair of the cable communications system; that the city deems relevant to monitoring compliance with the terms of this chapter, a franchise or applicable law; or that the city deems relevant to the exercise of any right or duty of the city under the same. Each cable communications system operator is responsible for maintaining control over such books and records, whether created by grantee, or by those acting on its behalf. It is responsible for producing these records upon city's request, for city's inspection and copying. Books and records must be maintained for a period five years, except that a franchise ordinance may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. The phrase "books and records" shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. 
(b)  Books and records requested shall be produced for review at city hall, or such other location, the parties may agree. However, if the requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied and moved, then the franchisee may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by city and the franchisee, provided that: (1) the franchisee must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by city after its review; and (2) the franchisee must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by city (above those that would have been incurred had the documents been produced in city) in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.470 - Reports. 
(a)  The city manager may from time to time direct a franchisee to prepare reports and to submit those reports by a date certain, in a format prescribed by the manager, in addition to those required by this chapter. 
(b)  Upon written request by the city manager, within forty-five days of the end of each calendar year, a franchisee shall submit a report to city containing the following information: 
(1)  The number of service calls (calls requiring a truck roll) received during the prior year and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber base; and 
(2)  The total estimated hours of known outages as a percentage of total hours of operation. An outage is a loss of all sound or video on any signal, affecting five or more subscribers. 
(c)  Unless an exemption is granted by the city manager, no later than ninety days after the end of its fiscal year, a franchisee shall submit the following information, except that the information required by subsection (c)(3) of this section need only be provided where there has been a change from the preceding year: 
(1)  A fully audited or certified revenue report from the previous calendar year for the cable communications system, to the extent prepared in the regular course of business and a certified statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed explanation of the method of computation showing: (i) gross revenues by category (e.g., basic, pay, pay-per-view, advertising, installation, equipment, late charges, miscellaneous, other); and (ii) what, if any, deductions were made from gross revenues in calculating the franchise fee (e.g., bad debt, credits and refunds), and the amount of each deduction. 
(2)  A report showing, for each applicable customer service standard, the franchisee's performance with respect to that standard for each quarter of the preceding year. In each case where franchisee concludes it did not comply fully, the franchisee will describe the corrective actions it is taking to assure future compliance. In addition, the report should identify the number and nature of the customer service complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions. 
(3)  An ownership report, indicating all persons who at the time of filing control or own an interest in the franchisee of ten percent or more. 
(d)  Within ten days of their receipt or (in the case of documents created by the cable communications system operator or a person acting on its behalf) filing, a franchisee shall provide city: 
(1)  Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the cable communications system; and 
(2)  Any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee directly or indirectly. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.480 - Maps required. 
    Each franchisee shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans that show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way or on public property and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Upon thirty days written notice, a franchisee shall provide current strand and trench maps of the cable system in the franchise area to the city. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk, in a mutually agreed upon format. Whenever requested to do so in writing by city's director of public works, franchisee shall pothole as necessary to verify the depth of certain specified existing facilities. Such pot-holing shall be completed within thirty days of franchisee's receipt of such written request. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.490 - Other records required. 
    Franchisees shall not be required to maintain any books and records for franchise compliance purposes longer than five years. Unless the city manager specifically waives the requirement in writing, a franchisee shall at all times maintain: 
(a)  Records of all written complaints received, including complaints received via electronic mail, their nature and resolution. The term "complaints" refers to complaints about any aspect of the franchisee's construction, operations or repairs activities; 
(b)  Records of outages known to the franchisee, their cause and duration; 
(c)  Records of service calls for repair and maintenance indicating the nature of the call for service, the date and time service was requested, the date of acknowledgment and date and time service was scheduled (if it was scheduled), and the date and time service was provided, and (if different) the date and time the problem was solved; 
(d)  Records of installation/reconnection and requests for service extension, indicating date of request, date of acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended; 
(e)  Records sufficient to show whether the franchisee has complied with each customer service standard that apply to it. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.500 - Exemptions. 
    The city manager may temporarily exempt any franchisee from its obligations under Sections 5.20.470 through 5.20.490 if the city manager determines that the requirement would be unduly burdensome or unnecessary, and that city and subscriber interests may be adequately protected in some other manner. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.510 - Privacy. 
    A franchisee shall take all reasonable steps required so that it is able to provide reports, books and records to city, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each franchisee shall be responsible for redacting data that applicable law prevents it from providing to city. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a franchisee to violate state or federal subscriber privacy laws. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.520 - Procedures for paying franchise fees and fees in lieu of franchise fees. 
(a)  The franchise fee paid pursuant to Article 3, and the fee in lieu of franchise fee paid pursuant to Article 4 shall be paid quarterly unless otherwise specified in a franchise. Payment for each quarter shall be made to city by check not later than thirty days after the end of the respective calendar quarter. Upon receipt of written notice from the city manager that future payments shall be made by electronic transfer, franchisee shall be required to make all future payments by electronic transfer not later than the due date described above. 
(b)  Unless a franchise ordinance expressly provides otherwise, a franchisee or other person subject to a fee under Articles 3 or 4 shall file with city within thirty days of the end of each calendar quarter a statement showing gross revenues during the preceding quarter and the number of subscribers served. 
(c)  No acceptance by city of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a release of any claim city may have for additional sums payable or otherwise related to that payment. 
(d)  Neither the franchise fee under Article 3, nor the fee paid in lieu of the franchise fee under Article 4, is a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment. 
(e)  In the event that the full amount of any fee that is owed by franchisee hereunder is not received by city on or before the due date set forth in this section or in a franchise ordinance, the franchisee or person subject to the fee shall be obligated to pay interest on the outstanding amount owed from the due date at an annual rate equal to the higher of ten percent or the legal rate of interest then in force in the state of California. 
(f)  Within ninety days of the date a franchisee ceases operations under a franchise (whether because of franchise termination, transfer, bankruptcy or for any other reason), the franchisee (or its successor in interest) shall: (a) make a final franchise fee payment, covering the period from the end of prior calendar month to date the franchisee ceased operations; and (b) file a final statement of gross revenues covering the period from the beginning of the calendar year in which the operations ceased to the date operations ceased. The statement shall contain the information and be certified as required by Section 5.20.470(c)(1).

(c)  Subject to applicable law, an application may be rejected if it is incomplete, or if the response to requests for information is not timely and complete. 
(Ord. 2036 § 1(part), 2003). 
5.20.580 - Application for an initial franchise or renewal franchise. 
(a)  This section establishes additional provisions that apply to an application for an initial franchise, or a renewal franchise application that is not governed by 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a)-(h) as may be amended. 
(b)  Any person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise by submitting an application therefor on that person's own initiative, or in response to a request for proposals issued by city.

City may conduct such investigations as are necessary to act on an application. 
(c)  Before taking final action on an application, the city shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with applicable state and federal law. 
(d)  In determining whether to grant a franchise, city may consider:

(3)  Where the applicant has not previously held a cable system franchise in city, whether the applicant's record in other communities indicates that it can be relied upon to provide high-quality service throughout any franchise term; 
(4)  Whether the applicant has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in an application, and to satisfy any minimum requirements established by city; 
(5)  Whether the applicant's application is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of city, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
(6)  Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on streets, public property, and private property that will be used by the applicant's cable system; 
(7)  Whether issuance of the franchise would reduce competition in the provision of cable service in city; 
(8)  Whether the applicant has proposed to provide adequate facilities, equipment, channels and other support for PEG use of the cable system; 
(9)  Such other matters as city is permitted by applicable law to consider.

    In addition to the grounds set forth governing the issuance of licenses upon which an application for an owner's license may be denied, the city council shall deny the same if it appears to its satisfaction that such vehicle proposed to be operated is inadequate or unsafe; that the applicant has been convicted of a felony or violation of any narcotic law or of any penal law involving moral turpitude; that the name under which applicant will do business, or applicant's proposed color scheme, or other insignia, will tend to confuse the identification of the taxicabs proposed to be operated by such applicant with those of another owner operating in the city. 
    The city council may deny the granting of any license to operate any public motor vehicle in the city for the reason that the public convenience or necessity does not require such additional taxicab operations, or for any other reasonable cause which, within its sound discretion, renders the proposed operations undesirable to the city, or inadequate. 
    The city council may revoke any owner's license for a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulations, relating to traffic or use of streets, or for a failure to pay any judgment for damages arising from the unlawful or negligent operation of the public motor vehicle for which the license was issued; provided, however, that no such license shall be revoked, except after notice to the owner to show cause why it should not be revoked at a hearing before the council. The notice shall be in writing and state the reason for revocation, and the time and place of hearing. Not less than ten days shall be given for such hearing.

5.45.060 - On-site security. 
(1)  If the proposed or current business location is to be used at least in part for the sale of firearms or firearm components, the permitted place of business shall be a secure facility within the meaning of Penal Code Section 12071(c)(2).* 
    *A "secure facility" is defined by Penal Code § 12071(c)(2) as a building that meets certain specifications, including: certain types of locks on all doorways; steel bars on all windows; and steel bars, metal grating, or an alarm system on all heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and service openings. State law allows a firearms dealer to avoid these requirements by utilizing other security features. See Penal Code § 12071(b)(14). Penal Code § 12071(b)(15) explicitly allows local jurisdictions to impose security requirements on firearms dealers that are stricter or at a higher standard than those imposed by state law. 
(2)  If the proposed or current business location is to be used at least in part for the sale of firearms or firearm components, all heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and service openings shall be secured with steel bars or metal grating. 
(3)  Any time a permittee is not open for business, every firearm or firearm component shall be stored in one of the following ways: 
(a)  In a locked fireproof safe or vault in the licensee's business premises that meets the standards for a gun safe implemented by the Attorney General pursuant to Penal Code Section 12088.2; or 
(b)  Secured with a hardened steel rod or cable of at least one-fourth inch in diameter through the trigger guard of the firearm. The steel rod or cable shall be secured with a hardened steel lock that has a shackle. The lock and shackle shall be protected or shielded from the use of a boltcutter and the rod or cable shall be anchored in a manner that prevents the removal of the firearm from the premises. No more than five firearms may be affixed to any one rod or cable at any time. 
(4)  Any time a permittee is open for business, every firearm shall be unloaded, inaccessible to the public and secured using one of the following three methods, except in the immediate presence of and under the direct supervision of an employee of the permittee: 
(a)  Secured within a locked case so that a customer seeking access to the firearm must ask an employee of the permittee for assistance; 
(b)  Secured behind a counter where only the permittee and the permittee's employees are allowed. During the absence of the permittee or a permittee's employee from the counter, the counter shall be secured with a locked, impenetrable barrier that extends from the floor or counter to the ceiling; or 
(c)  Secured with a hardened steel rod or cable of at least one-fourth inch in diameter through the trigger guard of the firearm. The steel rod or cable shall be secured with a hardened steel lock that has a shackle. The lock and shackle shall be protected or shielded from the use of a boltcutter and the rod or cable shall be anchored in a manner that prevents the removal of the firearm from the premises. No more than five firearms may be affixed to any one rod or cable at any time. 
(5)  Any time a permittee is open for business, every firearm component, and any ammunition that is not principally for use in pistols, revolvers, or other firearms capable of being concealed upon the person, as that term is defined in Penal Code § 12001(a), shall be inaccessible to the public and secured using one of the methods mentioned in subsection (4)(a) or (b), except in the immediate presence of and under the direct supervision of an employee of the permittee.* 
*Penal Code § 12061(a)(2) addresses the storage of handgun ammunition by sellers. That provision is effective January 1, 2010. See AB 962 (De Leon). "Handgun ammunition" is defined as ammunition principally for use in pistols, revolvers, or other firearms capable of being concealed upon the person, as that term is defined in Penal Code § 12001(a). Penal Code § 12060(b). 
(6)  The permitted business location shall be secured by an alarm system that is installed and maintained by an alarm company operator licensed pursuant to the Alarm Company Act, Business & Professions Code Sections 7590 et seq. The alarm system must be monitored by a central station listed by Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., and covered by an active Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. alarm system certificate with a #3 extent of protection, or system that provides a comparable level of protection.* 
*Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. uses the term "extent of protection" to refer to the amount of alarm protection installed to protect a particular area, room or container. Systems with a #3 extent of protection include complete protection for all accessible openings, and partial motion and sound detection at certain other areas of the premises. For more information, see Central Station Alarm Association, A Practical Guide to Central Station Burglar Alarm Systems (3rd ed. 2005). 
(7)  The permitted business location shall be monitored by a video surveillance system that meets the following requirements: 
(a)  The system shall include cameras, monitors, digital video recorders, and cabling, if necessary. 
(b)  The number and location of the cameras shall at a minimum, as determined by the Chief of Police, be sufficient in number and location to monitor the critical areas of the business premises, including, but not limited to, all places where firearms, firearm components or ammunition are stored, handled, sold, transferred, or carried, including, but not limited to, all counters, safes, vaults, cabinets, cases, entryways, and parking lots. The video surveillance system shall operate continuously, without interruption, whenever the permittee is open for business. Whenever the permittee is not open for business, the system shall be triggered by a motion detector and begin recording immediately upon detection of any motion within the monitored area. 
(c)  In addition, the sale or transfer of a firearm, firearm component or ammunition shall be recorded by the video surveillance system in such a way that the facial features of the purchaser or transferee are clearly visible. 
(d)  When recording, the video surveillance system shall record continuously and store color images of the monitored area at a frequency of not less than fifteen frames per second.* The system must produce retrievable and identifiable images and video recordings on media determined by the Chief of Police to be able to be enlarged through projection or other means, and can be made a permanent record for use in a criminal investigation. The system must be capable of delineating on playback the activity and physical features of persons or areas within the premises. 
*Television in the U.S. has 30 frames per second. However, 15 frames per second is generally described as viewable, and is used in similar regulations. See, e.g., 02-392-013 Me. Code R. 6(6). 
(e)  The stored images shall be maintained on the business premises of the permittee for a period not less than one year from the date of recordation and shall be made available for inspection by federal, state or local law enforcement upon request. 
(f)  The video surveillance system must be maintained in proper working order at all times. If the system becomes inoperable, it must be repaired or replaced within fifteen calendar days. The permittee must inspect the system at least weekly to ensure that it is operational and images are being recorded and retained as required. 
(g)  The permittee shall post a sign in a conspicuous place at each entrance to the premises that states in block letters not less than one inch in height: THESE PREMISES ARE UNDER VIDEO SURVEILLANCE. YOUR IMAGE MAY BE RECORDED. 
(8)  The Chief of Police may impose security requirements in addition to those listed in this section prior to issuance of the law enforcement permit if the Chief of Police finds that such requirements are necessary to provide adequate security. Failure to fully comply with the requirements of this section shall be sufficient cause for denial or revocation of the law enforcement permit by the Chief of Police. 
(Ord. No. 2150, § 1(Exh. A), 9-20-2011) 
5.45.070 - Liability insurance.

The policy shall also name the City and its officers, employees and agents as additional insured's. The limits of liability shall not be less than one million dollars for each incident of damage to property or incident of injury or death to a person; provided, however, that increased limits of liability may be required by the City Counsel if deemed necessary to provide adequate coverage against potential claims.

(2)  If the property owner does not accomplish the more frequent pick-ups, provision of the larger containers, or removal of the excess waste within fifteen days from the date set forth in the notice, the city can provide for more frequent pickups, larger containers, or removal of excess waste, and have the property owner billed for the cost;

(g)  If no written protest is received within fifteen days from the date of mailing of the notice described in subsection (f), and the property owner has not voluntarily complied with the requirements of the agent, then the agent may provide the more frequent pick-ups, larger containers, or removal of excess waste, and have any and all resulting costs incurred by the city including any administrative costs invoiced to the owner. 
(h)  If the owner files a written protest within fifteen days from the date of mailing of the agent's notice, then the city manager shall review the written protest and all available relevant evidence, and render a written decision on the merits of the protest within fifteen days of receipt of the letter of protest. If the city manager finds that more frequent pick-ups, larger containers or removal of excess waste was reasonably necessary to prevent the accumulation of excess waste material, the city manager shall deny the protest, and order all resulting costs incurred by the city including administrative costs invoiced to the owner; otherwise the city manager shall modify or rescind the agent's determination as is reasonably necessary to prevent accumulation of excess waste material. 
(i)  In the event that immediate removal of excess waste is necessary to avert an eminent threat of serious harm to the public health and safety, the city may take steps to remove such excess waste without strict compliance with the notice and protest requirements of subsections (f) and (h); provided, that the owner is given as much notice and an opportunity to protest as the urgency of the situation can reasonably afford; and, any and all costs incurred by the city including administrative costs will be invoiced to the owner. 
(j)  If the owner does not pay all costs invoiced to the owner pursuant to subsections (g), (h) or (i), the costs shall become a special assessment against the real property to which it relates, and the city council may, upon finding that the costs were reasonable and necessary, order that the costs shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.

The property owner shall be given notice of the date, time, place and purpose of the hearing by first class United States mail, mailed at least fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner shall be given an opportunity to address the council regarding the necessity and reasonableness of the costs invoiced to the owner. 
    If the council, after reviewing all the evidence presented, determines that all of the invoiced costs were reasonable and necessary, the council may order imposition of a lien for the full amount of such costs incurred by the city including any administrative costs; otherwise, the council shall reduce or eliminate the lien to an amount equal to the reasonable and necessary costs arising out of the provision of the more frequent pick-ups, larger containers, or removal of excess waste.

6.10.180 - Administrative penalties and procedures. 
(a)  Applicability. The city has determined that the enforcement of this code is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety and welfare. The city has determined that there is a need for alternative methods of code enforcement and that a comprehensive code enforcement system includes criminal, civil and administrative remedies. This section provides for the enforcement of violations of this chapter by administrative citations, which are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which the city may pursue to address code violations. Use of this section is at the sole discretion of the city. This section is authorized under Government Code Sections 53069.4 and 36901. 
(b)  Administrative Citations. 
(1)  Authority. Whenever an enforcement officer determines a violation of this chapter has occurred or exists, the enforcement officer has the authority to issue an administrative citation to any responsible person. 
(2)  If the violation of this chapter pertains to building, plumbing, electrical, mechanical, or other similar structural or zoning issues that do not create an immediate danger to health or safety, the enforcement officer shall provide for a reasonable period of time for the responsible person to correct or remedy the violation before imposing administrative fines or penalties. 
(3)  Contents of Citation. An administrative citation issued under this section shall contain the following information: 
(A)  The section of the code violated; 
(B)  A description of the condition creating or constituting the violation; 
(C)  The date and location of the violation; 
(D)  The name of the responsible person to whom the administrative citation is issued; 
(E)  The name and signature of the enforcement officer issuing the administrative citation; 
(F)  The date the administrative citation was issued; 
(G)  The amount of all applicable fines and enforcement costs; 
(H)  A description of the process and timing for payment of fines and enforcement costs; 
(I)  A description of the administrative citation review process, including the time within which the administrative citation may be contested, the place from which to obtain a request for hearing form to contest the administrative citation, and the hearing officer's discretion to impose additional remedies to the city pursuant to subsection (f)(1)(C). 
(4)  Dismissal of an Administrative Citation. At any time before the hearing to contest an administrative citation, if the enforcement officer determines that there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation or that the citation should be dismissed in the interest of justice, the enforcement officer shall dismiss the administrative citation and cancel the hearing. To the extent the enforcement officer determines that a person is not responsible for some or all of a previously paid administrative fine or fee, the enforcement officer shall refund the appropriate amount. The enforcement officer shall notify the person to whom the citation was issued in writing, and make a written notation in the file explaining why the citation was dismissed and why any fine or fee was refunded. 
(c)  Payment of Fines and Enforcement Costs. 
(1)  Amount of Fine. Unless otherwise specified in this code or authorized by state law, or unless established by resolution of the city council, the amount of the fine imposed for each violation of this chapter shall be established as follows: 
(A)  One hundred dollars for a first violation that would constitute an infraction pursuant to Section 6.10.170; 
(B)  Two hundred dollars for a second violation within twelve months of the same provision of this chapter that would constitute an infraction pursuant to Section 6.10.170; 
(C)  Five hundred dollars for each day of each additional violation of the same code section within twelve months that would constitute an infraction pursuant to Section 6.10.170; 
(D)  One thousand dollars per day for each day of each violation of a provision of this code that would constitute misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Amount of Enforcement Costs. In addition to the amount of any fine imposed pursuant to this section, a fee to cover enforcement costs may be imposed pursuant to Section 6.10.190. 
(3)  Due Date. All fines and fees for enforcement costs shall be due and paid to the city within thirty days from the date of the administrative citation. The enforcement officer may suspend the imposition of fines for any period of time during which the responsible person has filed for necessary permits, and such permits are required to achieve compliance, and the responsible person is actively pursuing permit approval and full compliance. 
(4)  Further Violations Not Excused. Payment of a fine under this section does not excuse or discharge any continuation or repeated occurrence of the violation. 
(d)  Hearing Request. 
(1)  A person to whom an administrative citation is issued may request an administrative hearing within ten days of the issuance of the administrative citation. Failure to timely request an administrative hearing in the manner required by this chapter constitutes a waiver of the hearing and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. 
(2)  A request for an administrative hearing shall be made in writing and filed with the city, and shall state all grounds which the appellant wishes the city to consider. The request shall be accompanied by a deposit of the fines and enforcement costs identified in the administrative citation. Provided, however, a deposit is not required to be paid prior to the hearing if either: (1) the enforcement officer does not identify the requirement to pay the deposit as a part of the administrative citation or compliance order, or (2) the appellant establishes, to the satisfaction of the enforcement officer, that he or she is unable to pay the amount of the deposit. 
(3)  If the enforcement officer determines that the code violation is of an ongoing or recurring nature, the enforcement officer may cause a written notice of administrative hearing to be served on any responsible person. The enforcement officer's notice under this subsection may order the responsible person to appear at the hearing and show cause why the violations and conditions should not be immediately abated by the responsible person at the responsible person's expense. 
(e)  Hearing Procedure. 
(1)  The hearing officer for an administrative hearing shall be designated pursuant to Section 6.10.210. 
(2)  The code enforcement officer shall serve written notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing on the cited responsible person pursuant to subsection (g). The hearing date shall be set on the first available date for the designated hearing officer not less than fifteen days after the date that the request for hearing is filed, and not less than ten days after the date of the notice of hearing. 
(3)  The hearing officer may continue a hearing from time to time, and may request additional information from the enforcement officer or the cited responsible person before issuing a decision. 
(4)  Reports prepared by the enforcement officer concerning a code violation shall be accepted by the hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the facts stated in such documents. If the enforcement officer submits any such documents to the hearing officer, then a copy of the documents shall be served on the cited responsible person at least five days before the hearing. 
(5)  The enforcement officer and other representatives of the city may, but need not, appear and present evidence at the hearing. 
(6)  The failure of the cited responsible person to appear at the hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust his or her administrative remedies. 
(7)  At the hearing, the cited responsible person shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present evidence concerning the citation, including any evidence to show cause why the violation should not be abated at the cost of the cited responsible person. The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the technical rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might consider such admission improper in a civil action. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence. 
(f)  Hearing Officer's Decision. 
(1)  After considering the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision, based on the preponderance of evidence, to uphold, dismiss, or modify the administrative citation in whole or in part, including the findings on which the decision was made. The hearing officer shall send a copy of the decision to the cited responsible person and to the enforcement officer. 
(A)  The hearing officer's decision shall identify the responsible person's obligation to correct any existing or ongoing code violations. The decision shall identify a reasonable period of time for the responsible person to correct the violation, based on the means required to abate the violation, the potential threat to public health or safety, and the duration (or repetitive nature) of the violation. 
(B)  The hearing officer's decision shall identify the responsible person's obligation to pay all amounts owed for fines and enforcement costs (including any amounts owed through the date that all violations are corrected). In determining the amounts owed, the hearing officer has the discretion to increase or reduce the amount of the fine imposed by the enforcement officer based on any or all of the following factors: (1) the duration of the violation; (2) the frequency, recurrence and number of violations, related or unrelated, by the same violator; (3) the seriousness of the violation; (4) the good faith efforts of the violator to come into compliance; (5) the economic impact of the fine on the violator; (6) the impact of the violation on the community; and (7) such other factors as justice requires. 
(C)  If the hearing officer determines that the seriousness or duration of the violation warrants additional remedies, the hearing officer may order, in addition to other remedies, any or all of the following: 
(i)  The responsible person shall deposit funds with the city to offset the city's cost to conduct ongoing compliance monitoring for a specified period of time; 
(ii)  If the remedy of nuisance abatement is requested by the city pursuant to Section 6.10.050, and the responsible person fails to correct the violation within the time specified by the hearing officer, the city shall be authorized to enter onto the property to abate the violation without further notice; and the responsible person shall pay all actual expenses incurred by the city to abate the violation pursuant to Section 6.10.120, and the responsible person may be required to deposit with the city an estimated amount needed to abate the violation; 
(iii)  The responsible person shall attend a mandatory training program with the goal of minimizing the likelihood of repeat violations; 
(iv)  The person shall report back to the hearing officer by a specified date regarding the status of compliance. 
(2)  The hearing officer's decision is final, and may not be appealed. The decision shall include information regarding the responsible person's right to seek judicial review of the hearing officer's decision pursuant to Section 6.10.220(b). 
(3)  To the extent the hearing officer's decision identifies the responsible person's entitlement to a refund, the city shall make payment to the responsible person within thirty days of the notice of decision. 
(g)  Notices. Notices provided pursuant to this section shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified in this code, any compliance order, administrative citation, or any notices required to be given pursuant to this section, shall be served either: (1) by personal delivery to the person to be notified, or (2) by deposit in the United States mail in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the person to be notified at the person's last known business or residence address (as determined by the enforcement officer), or (3) if the enforcement officer reasonably determines that posting the notice would be more effective, by conspicuously posting a copy for a period of ten days at the real property that is the subject of the violation, and publication in a newspaper of general circulation pursuant to California Government Code Section 6062; 
(2)  When real property is involved in the violation, notices by United States mail may be served on the responsible party at the address as shown on the last equalized county assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. The enforcement officer may, in his or her discretion, also serve notice on a tenant, a mortgagor or any other person having an interest in the real property;

6.30.010 - Findings and purpose.

B.  EPS disposable food service ware comprises an eight percent by volume of total litter observed in storm drains in Santa Clara County; and 
C.  The proposed prohibition of EPS disposable food service ware would require food vendors to use alternative food service ware that will result in a reduction of EPS litter, reduce the risk of harm to aquatic wildlife, and improve water quality in the Cupertino creeks and the Southern San Francisco Bay; and 
D.  On November 18, 2014, prior to taking action on the Ordinance, the City Council reviewed, considered and adopted by separate Council resolution, the proposed Negative Declaration analyzing the regional environmental impacts of the Ordinance to prohibit EPS disposable food service ware; and 
E.  The City of Campbell intends and does hereby find that this Ordinance falls within the scope of the City of San José's Program Initial Study/Negative Declaration for EPS.

C.  The food vendor must demonstrate both of the following to qualify for a "financial hardship" exemption: (1) a gross income under three hundred thousand on their annual income tax filing for the most recent tax year, and (2) with respect to each specific and necessary polystyrene foam disposable food service ware, that there is no feasible alternative that would cost the same or less than the polystyrene foam disposable food service ware.

Chapter 8.38 - MEDICAL MARIJUANA 

8.38.010 - Legislative Findings and Statement of Purpose. 
A.  The City Council finds that the prohibitions on marijuana processing, and marijuana dispensaries are necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare for the City and its community. The City Council's prohibition of such activities is within the authority conferred upon the City Council in state law. 
B.  On October 9, 2015, the governor signed the "Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act" ("Act") into law. The Act became effective January 1, 2016 and contains new statutory provisions that: 
1.  Allow local governments to enforce new and existing ordinances expressing their intent to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana and their intent not to administer a conditional permit program pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana (Health & Safety Code § 11362.777(c)(4)); 
2.  Expressly provide that the Act does not supersede or limit local authority for local law enforcement activity, enforcement of local ordinances, or enforcement of local permit or licensing requirements regarding marijuana (Business & Professions Code § 19315(a)); 
3.  Expressly provide that the Act does not limit the authority or remedies of a local government under any provision of law regarding marijuana, including but not limited to a local government's right to make and enforce within its limits all police regulations not in conflict with general laws (Business & Professions Code § 19316(c)); and 
4.  Require a local government that wishes to prevent marijuana delivery activity, as defined in Business & Professions Code section 19300.5(m) of the Act, from operating within the local government's boundaries to enact an ordinance affirmatively banning such delivery activity (Business & Professions Code § 19340(a)). 
C.  The City Council finds that this Chapter: (1) acknowledges that existing provisions of Title 21 of the Campbell Municipal Code currently prohibit the processing or dispensing of marijuana in the City, as well as limiting the cultivation of marijuana to six plants located on a residence for the personal use of the residents, and precludes a conditional permit program pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana in the City; (2) exercises its local authority to enact and enforce local regulations and ordinances, including those regarding the permitting, licensing, or other entitlement of the activities prohibited by this Chapter; and (3) exercises its police power to enact and enforce regulations for the public benefit, safety, and welfare of the City and its community . 
D.  The City Council recognizes that despite the negative impacts identified above, marijuana can provide some benefit to qualified patients. In this regard, the City Council finds that the delivery of medical marijuana to qualified patients from licensed dispensaries located outside of the City of Campbell would provide access to medical marijuana for those patients seeking such medication, while presenting the least negative impact on City resources and the quality of life in Campbell.

(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.030 - General purpose and intent. 
    The provisions of this chapter are intended to define the requirement policies and procedures for the acquisition of public streets and highways and public easements, and for the construction of public improvements, in connection with the development of areas and parcels of property, in order to: 
A.  Ensure that lands hereafter developed are put to uses compatible with their surrounding areas, and which uses will not unduly adversely affect other persons, or land, or the general public; 
B.  Spread the costs of required public improvements upon the abutting properties, as contemplated by law; 
C.  Cause the installation of those improvements necessary properly to serve the property developed at the time of its development, so far as may be practicable, so that the benefiting property may enjoy the use of such improvements throughout the normal life thereof; 
D.  Protect the vested interest of the public in the pre-existing capacity of the city's streets and highways; 
E.  Promote the installation of all necessary street improvements in the most economically feasible manner, both to city and to the owners of affected parcels of land; 
F.  Protect the public safety, living standards and common welfare of the general public. 
(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.040 - Requirements-General. 
    Except as provided for in Section 11.24.180 of this chapter or other adopted council policy, any person who proposes to erect, construct, add to, alter or repair any building or structure for which a building permit is required by the city on or upon any land adjacent to an unimproved street, or who seeks a use permit, planned development permit, or architectural and site approval, or a tentative map approval from the city for land adjacent to or containing an unimproved street must improve, or agree to improve by street improvement agreement or deferred street improvement agreement such street as herein required. The permittee shall install such improvements that the city engineer deems necessary, in accordance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter as specified in Section 11.24.030 of this chapter, which may include the following; curbs and gutters, driveways, sidewalks, overlay, pavement structural section, pavement striping, street lights, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, street trees, street signs, water lines, fire hydrants, monumentation, retaining walls and, where necessary, the dedications and improvement of service roads, facilities for off-street parking, alleys, easements for public utilities, drainage, sewers, walkways, watercourses, planting strips and nonaccess facilities. Such improvements or agreement to install such improvements shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any required building permit, use permit, planned development permit, or site and architectural approval. The public works director and the city engineer or their designees shall have the authority to execute such agreements on behalf of the city in accordance with this chapter. 
(Ord. 2059 § 1(Exh. A)(part), 2005: Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.050 - Deferred street improvement agreements. 
    Deferred street improvement agreements may be allowed when the city engineer has determined that extenuating circumstances exist and the deferral of the street improvements is reasonable and appropriate, or when the following conditions are satisfied: 
1.  The property is not adjacent to existing improvements of the same type being required; and 
2.  Agreements do not exist for installation of street improvements for all properties between the subject property and existing improvements of the type being required; and 
3.  There are no capital improvement projects identified in the current capital improvement program for installation of the required street improvements within the next seven years; and 
4.  The deferral of the street improvements is not in conflict with any other adopted city council policy. 
(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.060 - Credit-Purpose. 
    The owner of any parcel of land for which dedications have been made or for which improvements have been installed as required by this chapter, shall receive credit in the event that the parcel involved is subsequently included in a city assessment district proceeding as determined by the engineer's report for the applicable proceeding. No person shall receive a credit in excess of the amount of dedication required or the cost of the improvements required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.070 - Improvements installed by others-Preceding permit. 
    In some instances, the public welfare and convenience and the greatest economy and safety can be accomplished by the acquisition of land and the installation of improvements on unimproved streets prior to the time that a property owner or owners seek a permit. Such owners, or their successors in title, are required to contribute their fair, equitable share to the street improvements in such areas (just as permittees who seek a permit prior to the installation of improvements are required to do) when their property develops, or when they seek a permit. 
    In such instances where land has been acquired and improvements have been installed by the city, anyone seeking a permit with respect to the property abutting such acquired land or installed improvements, as a condition precedent to obtaining such permit shall reimburse the city for the cost of the land acquired and improvements installed as specified in the notice of improvement obligation provided for in Section 11.24.080 of this chapter. 
    The obligation to pay for previously installed street improvements or previously acquired land shall not be imposed as a result of the reconstruction of a building that was damaged or destroyed by earthquake, fire, flood, or other physical peril over which the owner had no control, except as follows: 
(1)  When construction of a replacement building substantially exceeds the floor area of the damaged or destroyed building; 
(2)  Where the damaged or destroyed building had been a nonconforming use which is prohibited from being resumed under the provision of the code; or 
(3)  Where the damage or destruction of the building is the result of an action of the city, state or federal government's acting under color of law. 
    If the improvements installed by the city prior to the issuance of the permit are less than the improvements required by, or authorized to be required by, this chapter, the permittee shall make, or agree to make, such other improvements, all as required by this chapter. A permittee who obtains his permit after improvements have been made shall be required to provide the equivalent of what would have been required to provide had the permit predated the improvements, as determined by the city engineer in accordance with the general purpose and intent of this chapter as specified in Section 11.24.030. 
(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1611 § 1(part), 1986: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.080 - Notice of improvement obligations. 
    When land is purchased or street improvements are constructed by the city in accordance with Section 11.24.070 of this chapter, the director of public works and the city engineer or their designees, are authorized to execute and record a notice of improvement obligation or repayment agreement. Such notice or agreement shall describe the improvements constructed and any land purchased, and define the obligation of any property owner or future property owner. 
    Payments for both land and improvements shall include interest at a rate equal to one-half percent above the city's net effective portfolio yield calculated on a fiscal year basis. The interest rate on both land and improvements for each particular project shall be adjusted annually; and the amount of interest due shall accrue in the following manner: 
(1)  Land Cost. Interest to be accrued from the date of acquisition to the date the permittee is required to reimburse the city; 
(2)  Improvement Cost. Interest to accrue from the award of contract or, if installed by city forces, from the date of commencement to the date the permittee is required to reimburse the city. 
    However, the interest shall be waived if the abutting property owner dedicates or has dedicated to the city the required land for improvements. 
    Such notice of improvement obligation or repayment agreement shall constitute constructive notice of the obligation imposed by this chapter, but the failure to execute and record such notice or agreement shall not relieve any permittee or property owner or future property owner of his obligation. The director of public works and the city engineer or their designees are authorized to execute and record a notice of satisfaction of improvement obligation when the obligation created by Section 11.24.070 of this chapter has been satisfied. 
(Ord. 2059 § 2(Exh. A)(part), 2005: Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.24.090 - Rules and regulations. 
    The city engineer shall have the authority to establish reasonable rules and regulations consistent with the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of its administration and enforcement. Such rules and regulations shall be effective upon approval thereof by the city council. 
(Ord. 1951 § 2(part), 1997: Ord. 1814 § 4, 1990: Ord. 1522 § 1(part) 1984).

Unless otherwise required by the city engineer, dedication and improvement shall be for the full length of the property line of each parcel or parcels abutting the street or streets for which the building permit, use permit, planned development permit or site and architectural approval applies and any additional distance necessary to conform to existing improvements. 
B.  The permittee may be required to dedicate and improve walkways or to provide access to school, park or other public areas. 
C.  When the rear or side lines of any parcels border any major or secondary street, highway or parkway, the permittee may be required to execute and deliver to the city an instrument deemed sufficient by the city attorney, prohibiting the right of ingress and egress to such parcels across the sidelines of such street, highway or parkway. 
D.  The permittee shall grant easements for public utility and drainage purposes as deemed necessary by the city engineer. Dedication of easements shall be for the purpose of installing utilities and for other public purposes, as may be ordered or directed by the city engineer. 
E.  The permittee shall, subject to existing water rights, dedicate a right-of-way for storm drainage purposes conforming substantially with the lines of any natural watercourse or channel, stream or creek that traverses the development, or provide by dedication further and sufficient easements or construction, or both, to dispose of such surface and stormwater as determined by the city engineer as reasonably necessary. 
F.  Without limitation to any other provision of this chapter, the regulations herein contained are expressly declared to be applicable to any parcel which is abutted on one or more sides by a street, one or more of which is unimproved. The permittee shall have a separate obligation for each of such streets, to the extent that one or more shall be unimproved, and shall be required to install improvements and make provision for each of such streets in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
G.  The permittee may be required to quitclaim all of his rights and interests in, and grant to the city authorization to extract water from the underground strata lying beneath such tract or parcel.

In estimating the value of such past dedication and/or improvements, the city engineer's estimate of current land and/or construction costs shall apply. The credit allowed for past dedications and/or improvements, however, shall not exceed the cost of the land and/or improvements required by this chapter. 
B.  Whenever a parcel of land is brought within the jurisdiction of this chapter, and a permittee makes any dedication of land required by this chapter or makes or pays for any improvements required by this chapter, and said land is thereafter included in a city assessment district proceeding for the acquisition of land and the construction of some or all of the improvements of the kind required by this chapter, the permittee or his successor in title shall be entitled to a credit against such sums as the permittee shall be required to pay in the city assessment district proceeding as follows: 
1.  For any land dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, a permittee or his successor in title shall be entitled to a credit equal to the value of the land as appraised by city as of the time of the assessment proceedings (i.e., as of the time of the appraisal of other land included in the assessment proceedings); 
2.  For any improvements actually made pursuant to the provisions of the chapter, a permittee or his successor in title shall be entitled to a credit equal to the value of the improvements as appraised by the city as of the time of the assessment proceedings (i.e., as of the time of the appraisal of land included in the assessment proceedings); 
3.  For any improvements actually paid for pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, a permittee or his successor in title shall be entitled to a credit equal to the amount paid to the city, without interest; 
4.  Credit shall be allowed only for dedications actually made, or improvements actually made or actually paid for; no credit shall be allowed for dedications or improvements which a permittee has agreed to make or pay for, but has not made as of the date of the resolution or ordinance of intent to establish said district; 
5.  In the event a permittee has agreed to make or pay for dedication or improvements under the provisions of this chapter, but has not made or paid for said dedication or improvements as of the date of the resolution or ordinance of intent to establish said district, the permittee's contractual obligation to make or pay for said dedication or improvements shall be terminated, but only to the extent that said dedication or improvements shall be required, made and completed pursuant to said assessment district proceedings; 
6.  In no event shall the credit allowed exceed the amount which a permittee or his successor in title shall be obligated to pay under the assessment proceedings; 
7.  Appraisals for the purpose of determining credit shall be made by the city, and the amount thereof shall be at the sole discretion of the city and shall be binding upon a permittee or his successor in title;

A.  Whenever a street improvement agreement is executed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the permittee shall file with the city at the time of making said agreement a faithful performance bond to assure his full and faithful performance of the agreement. The permittee shall, in addition to the faithful performance, file with the city at the time of making the agreement a labor and materials bond in a penal sum adequate to making full payment of all labor and materials required to construct said improvements. The amount of the bonds shall be as determined by the city engineer. To assist the city engineer in estimating such bond amount, the permittee may be required to retain the services of an engineer, whose design estimates of quantity and cost can then be checked by the city engineer to determine their accuracy, completeness, and conformance to city standards. The bonds shall be executed by a surety company authorized to transact a surety business in the state of California. In the event that the permittee fails to faithfully perform the covenants and conditions of the agreement, the city shall call on the surety to perform the agreement or otherwise indemnify the city for the permittee's failure to do so. 
B.  In lieu of a surety bond, the permittee may elect to secure any said agreement by depositing with the city: 
1.  Cash; or 
2.  A cashier's check, or a certified check, payable to the order of the city; or 
3.  A certificate of deposit or irrevocable letters of credit as approved by the city attorney; or 
4.  Any other form of security determined by the city attorney and the city engineer to be equivalent to the foregoing. 
C.  The amount of said cash, checks, certificate of deposit or irrevocable letters of credit shall be as designated by the city engineer, and shall be the equivalent to that which would have been required had the permittee furnished the city with a surety bond. In the event that the permittee fails faithfully to perform the covenants and conditions of said agreements, the city may apply the proceeds of said security thereto. 
D.  Provision of security in accordance with this section shall not be deemed to relieve an applicant from the obligation to install the required improvements.

Money may be appropriated to this fund from time-to-time by appropriate action of the city council. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preclude the city council from approving the transfer of moneys from the deferred assessment revolving fund to any other city fund. Where available moneys in the deferred assessment revolving fund becomes insufficient to provide funding for all eligible applicants, the city shall have no obligation to transfer additional moneys into this fund from any other city fund. 
(Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.28.040 - General provision regarding eligibility. 
    The deferred assessment program, as set forth in this chapter, shall be available to any owner of an assessed lot which is located within any assessment district formed by action of the city council, on or after; provided, however, that such owner establishes his eligibility pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984). 
11.28.050 - Operation of the deferred assessment program. 
A.  The deferred assessment program shall operate as follows: 
1.  The owner of an assessed lot shall file an application with the city for the deferral of assessment. 
2.  The application shall be reviewed by the assessment deferral officer. 
3.  The application, along with the recommendation of the assessment deferral officer, shall be forwarded to the assessment deferral committee for action. 
4.  If the assessment deferral committee approves the application, the owner, as a condition of the city's approval deferring the assessment, shall do the following: 
a.  Execute a promissory note agreeing to repay the amount of assessment deferred, plus interest, late charges and attorney's fees should the city be required to institute proceedings to collect the amount of assessment deferred; 
b.  Execute an agreement with city which sets forth the amount of the deferred assessment, the terms and conditions of repayment, and provides that the city shall have a lien on the owner's assessed lot in a sum representing the amount of the deferred assessment. 
5.  Upon approval of an application for the deferral of assessments, the city, acting through the assessment deferral committee or the city council, shall order the withdrawal, from the deferred assessment revolving fund, of that sum of money representing the amount of assessment deferred, and place that sum, on behalf of the owner, into the construction fund for the assessment district which is being formed and within which the assessed lot of the owner is located. 
6.  The amount of the deferred assessment, including interest and late charges, shall be repaid by the owner upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 11.28.130 of this chapter. 
7.  All repayments of deferred assessments, including interest and other types of charges, shall be placed by the city into the deferred assessment revolving fund for future use in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  In terms of priority as to the other liens on the assessed lot, regardless of the time of their creation, the contractual lien representing the amount of the deferred assessment shall have that priority as is established by Chapter 2 of Part 4 of Division 1, commencing with Section 2186, of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the state. 
C.  The contractual lien on the owner's assessed lot established by this chapter shall not be deemed a transfer of a property interest in the owner's assessed lot but rather a form of security for repayment of the deferred assessment. If the amount of assessment deferred is not repaid by the owner upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 11.28.120 of this chapter, the city shall be entitled to utilize all legal remedies given to it by the lien instrument, as well as other remedies provided by law, to ensure that the amount of assessment deferred is repaid to the city and to the deferred assessment revolving fund. 
D.  Should an owner suffer either voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy at any time prior to repayment of the amount of the deferred assessment, the lien held by the city to secure the owner's promissory note to repay the same shall be entitled to that priority of payment as is provided for by federal law. 
E.  The city shall also be entitled to record a notice, pursuant to Civil Code Section 2924b that it be sent a copy of any notice of default and notice of sale under any earlier recorded deed or trust or mortgage on the assessed lot. 
(Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984).

C.  The amount of the owner's annual gross family income shall fall within the income ranges established and set forth on the deferred assistance schedule. 
(Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984).

2.  Moneys paid to the owner for the acquisition of right-of-way in connection with assessment district exclusive of: 
a.  That portion, if any, which is required to be applied toward the reduction of pre-existing liens on the assessed lot, and 
b.  That portion, if any, necessary to restore the property remaining after the acquisition. 
B.  The amount of assessment to be deferred for an eligible owner is found by utilizing the deferred assistance schedule to determine the number of members of the owner's family and then by matching the family's gross annual income with the gross family income figures set forth on the left-hand side of the schedule; said figures being expressed in terms of percentages of the median family income. 
(Ord. 1522 § 1(part), 1984).

13.08.040 - General standard. 
    The public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that four acres of property be devoted and developed for park and recreational purposes for each one thousand persons currently residing or who may in the future reside within the city, as determined in the open space element of the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. 1905 § 4(part), 1994). 
13.08.050 - Standards and formula for dedication of land. 
(a)  Acreage Formula. The formula for determining the amount of acreage to be dedicated and improved for recreation purposes and/or the equivalent fee to be paid shall be as follows: 
Number of 
Additional units × Average number of 
persons per unit × 4 acres 
1,000 population  
Example of a single-family dwelling unit: 
1 unit × 3.14 persons per unit × 4.0 acres per = .01256 acres 
1,000 persons  
(b)  Mixed Use Developments. Developments which allow residential units mixed on the same parcel or within the same development with nonresidential uses shall dedicate land and/or pay a fee based on the park acreage formula using the average number of persons expected in the six to thirteen dwelling unit per acre density range, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city council at the time of development approval that the unit size and characteristics anticipated for the residential units are more similar to one of the other residential dwelling unit density classifications and the site is constrained by a development approval which limits the number and type of residential units, in which case the city council shall determine the probable number of persons per unit to be used to fulfill the park dedication requirements. 
(Ord. 1905 § 4(part), 1994).

13.08.070 - Determination of land dedication or fee. 
(a)  Recreational Facility Within the Development. Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the open space element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed development to serve the immediate and future need of the residents of the development, the developer shall dedicate land for a park and provide park improvements sufficient to serve the residents of the development. 
(b)  No Recreational Facility Within the Development. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the open space element of the general plan to be located in whole or part within the proposed development, the city may either require dedication and improvement of land for park use and/or payment of a fee in lieu of dedicating land and providing improvements. 
(c)  Partial In-Lieu Fee Payment. Payment of an in-lieu fee shall be required for any development that does not dedicate sufficient land to satisfy the requirements of Section 13.08.050. The difference between the dedication standard and the amount of land dedicated shall be paid as an in-lieu fee as defined in this chapter. When a full or partial fee is required, the park acreage standard not satisfied by land dedication, shall be multiplied times the cost of land and improvements in accordance with Section 20.24.080 to determine the amount of the fee. 
(d)  No Criteria. If no criteria or specific sites for parks have been identified in the open space element of the city's general plan, the city council shall determine whether to require dedication of land, or payment of an in-lieu fee based on the factors outlined in Section 20.24.070(e) of this code. 
(e)  Land Dedication Satisfying the Requirement. If unimproved land is dedicated in lieu of providing the park improvements required by this chapter, the developer shall dedicate sufficient additional land of equivalent value to the value of the improvements that would otherwise have been required, or pay an equivalent fee, at the discretion of the city council. 
(f)  Council Determination. The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated or a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 1905 § 4(part), 1994).

The city council shall make a finding each fiscal year, prior to September 1st, based upon the recommendation of the city manager or his/her designee, with respect to any portion of the fee remaining uncommitted in its account five or more years after deposit of the fee to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it is charged. 
(c)  Refunds. Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the city shall refund to the then current record property owner or owners of lots or units of the development project or projects on a prorated basis the uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be demonstrated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Allocating Revenues for Other Related Purposes. If the administrative costs of refunding unexpended or uncommitted revenues pursuant to subsection (c) of this section exceed the amount to be refunded, the city, after a public hearing, notice of which has been published pursuant to Section 6061 of the California Government Code and posted in three prominent places within the area of the development project, may determine that revenues shall be allocated for some other purpose for which fees are collected subject to this chapter and which serves the project on which the fee was originally imposed. 
(e)  Use of Dedicated Land. Land dedicated pursuant to this chapter shall be used to provide the parks and park improvements specified in the general plan of the city.

(a)  Appeal for Reduction or Adjustment. The developer of a project subject to a dedication or fee pursuant to this chapter may appeal to the city council for a reduction or adjustment to that requirement, or a waiver on any of the following grounds: 
(1)  The absence of any reasonable relationship between the need for the park facilities and the impacts of the development; 
(2)  The absence of a reasonable relationship between the fees use and the impacts of the development; 
(3)  The determination of the fair market value of commercial or residential property or recreational facilities in the city by the city manager or his/her designee is unreasonable, as applied to the applicant's development or property; 
(4)  The credits provided in Section 13.08.110 have not been properly applied;

Title 14 - SEWERS 
Chapters: 
Chapter 14.02 - STORMWATER POLLUTION CONTROL 
Sections: 

14.02.010 - Purpose. 
(a)  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified urban stormwater runoff as the leading cause of water pollution in the United States. Furthermore, both federal and state agencies have identified stormwater runoff from the city as a major source of pollution adversely impacting the beneficial uses of the South San Francisco Bay. As a result, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region, has issued a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permit requiring the city to establish legal authorities sufficient to protect its municipal storm drain system from certain prohibited discharges. The city is also required to implement a stormwater management program to assure that stormwater runoff from the city does not cause or contribute to a violation of the water quality standards of South San Francisco Bay. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is therefore to provide minimum requirements designed to control the discharge of pollutants into the city municipal storm drain system and to assure that discharges from the city municipal storm drain system comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Clean Water Act and the current National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit No. CA0029718 including amendments and California Regional Water Quality Control Board approvals. Enactment of this chapter falls within the scope of the city police power to protect the health, safety and welfare of its residents. Nothing in this chapter is intended to preclude more stringent federal or state regulation or any activity covered by this chapter.

17.06.245 - Trade secrets. 
(a)  The permittee or permit applicant may make a claim for the protection of the identity of any hazardous material which is its trade secret by filing a declaration under penalty of perjury on a form provided by the city, signed by the permittee or permit applicant, supporting the trade secret status, for each hazardous material asserted to be a trade secret. The name of the hazardous material shall not be disclosed on the declaration. 
(b)  The exact name of the trade secret material, its quantity range by storage facility, and all other information required under Section 17.06.230(b) must, subject to the approval of city, be placed in a double-keyed lockbox and maintained in at least two locations at the facility. One key shall be provided to the city at the time the permit becomes effective. The other key shall be maintained on site at all times, and readily accessible to the permit-tee's designated emergency response person. Such emergency response person shall cooperate with the city in opening the lockbox at any time the city responds to an emergency or unauthorized discharge on the site involving the storage facility in which the trade secret material is contained. In the event that the permittee's designated emergency response person is not immediately available to assist city emergency response personnel to open the lockbox, such city personnel are authorized to break the lockbox. 
(c)  In addition to providing the lockboxes, the permittee or permit applicant shall provide information to the city under one of the following alternatives: 
(1)  Alternative One. In lieu of submitting the exact chemical name of the trade secret material, the permittee or permit applicant may submit a description of the hazardous material including, but not limited to, the chemical and physical properties, hazard class, reactivity characteristics, and fire and explosion characteristics of the trade secret material, at a level of specificity satisfactory to the city, and on a form provided by the city. The description must include health hazard information including remedies and countermeasures appropriate for emergency response and in case of human exposure to the trade secret material. Such description must be adequate to enable the city to assess the suitability of the proposed containment and the proposed monitoring plan.

(2)  Alternative Two. The trade secret information sought to be protected may be submitted to the city on a separate form or forms, clearly and conspicuously marked or labeled as containing trade secret information, and the form or forms must be submitted only to a city official designated by the city to receive trade secret information. If this method of protecting the trade secret information is chosen by the permittee or permit applicant, such party shall also submit a waiver, relieving the city of any and all liability resulting from disclosure of the trade secret in violation of this chapter. 
(i)  The city official shall endeavor to protect from disclosure any and all trade secrets which come into the city's possession pursuant to this subsection. If an action is instituted under the California Public Records Act for the release of such trade secrets, the permittee or permit applicant shall be deemed a real party in interest in any such action. Notice of a lawsuit to compel disclosure shall be given by the city to the permittee or permit applicant promptly upon receipt of such notice by the city. The permittee or permit applicant shall have the option to defend the city in any such action. The permittee or permit applicant shall indemnify the city in any such action. The permittee or permit applicant shall indemnify the city for all of the city's attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred in any proceeding related to this section, as well as for any judgment imposed pursuant to California Government Code Section 6259. 
(ii)  Any information reported to the city officer under this subsection, which is exempt from disclosure pursuant to this section, shall not be disclosed to anyone other than as required by law, except an officer or employee of the city in connection with the official duties of such officer or employee under any law for the protection of health, or to contractors with the city and their employees, if in the opinion of the city officer such disclosure is necessary and required for the satisfactory performance of a contract for performance of work. 
(iii)  Any person who by virtue of employment, contractual relationship or official position has obtained possession of or has had access to information, the disclosure of which is prohibited by this section, and who, knowing that disclosure of the information is prohibited, intentionally or recklessly disclosed the information in any manner to any person not entitled to receive it, or uses the information for his or her own use or advantage, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(iv)  Information certified by appropriate officials of the United States, as necessarily kept secret for national defense purposes, shall be accorded the full protection against disclosure as specified by such official or in accordance with the laws of the United States. 
(v)  The city council shall, by resolution, adopt a procedure designed to prevent knowing or negligent disclosure of trade secret information. Such procedure shall identify which officials shall have access to the information, and the means by which access will be con-trolled and monitored. Trade secret information shall be maintained in secured facilities which are designed to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized access or disclosure. 
(vi)  The confidential treatment, pursuant to this subsection, of the identity of such trade secret disclosed to the city does not apply where there has been any unauthorized discharge related to such trade secret material which is reportable in compliance with Section 17.06.250 or where such disclosure arises out of any official emergency response relating to the storage facility(ies) involving such trade secret information by public safety personnel of the city. 
(Added during 3/93 supplement). 
VI. - RESPONSIBILITY 

17.06.250 - Reporting unauthorized discharge. 
(a)  Liquids and Solids at STP. As soon as any person in charge of a storage facility or responsible for emergency response for a facility has knowledge of any confirmed or unconfirmed unauthorized discharge of hazardous material which is liquid or solid at STP, such person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery and containment and cleanup of such discharge and shall notify the city of the occurrence as required by this section. 
(1)  Confirmed Unauthorized Discharge. 
(A)  Recordable Unauthorized Discharge. Any recordable unauthorized discharge shall be contained and safely disposed of in an appropriate manner by the permittee and such occurrence and the response thereto shall be recorded in the permittee's monitoring records. A recordable unauthorized discharge is any unauthorized discharge of a hazardous material which meets all of the following criteria: 
(i)  The discharge is from a primary containment to a secondary containment or to a rigid aboveground surface covering capable of containing the discharge until cleanup of the hazardous material is completed; and 
(ii)  The permittee is able to adequately clean up the discharge before it escapes from such secondary containment or such aboveground surface, but if the cleanup requires more than eight hours, it becomes a reportable discharge in accordance with subsection (1)(C) of this section; and 
(iii)  There is no increase in the hazard of fire or explosion, nor is there any production of a flammable or poisonous gas, nor is there any deterioration of such secondary containment or such rigid above ground surface. 
(B)  An otherwise recordable unauthorized discharge does not need to be recorded if the discharge is not the result of the deterioration or failure of the primary container and the quantity discharged is less than one ounce by weight, and can be cleaned up within fifteen minutes. 
(C)  Reportable Unauthorized Discharge. Any unauthorized discharge which is not determined to be recordable under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section must be reported to the city immediately. The reporting party shall provide information to the city relating to the ability of the permittee to contain and dispose of the hazardous material, the estimated time it will take to complete the containment and disposal, and the degree of hazard created. The city may verify that the hazardous material is being contained and appropriately disposed of. The city, at any time upon a determination that the permittee is not adequately containing and disposing of such hazardous material, shall have the power and authority to undertake and direct an emergency response in order to protect the public health and/or safety. 
(2)  Unconfirmed Unauthorized Discharge. 
(A)  Indication of Loss in Inventory Records. Whenever a material balance or other inventory record, em-ployed as a monitoring technique under the HMMP, indicates a loss of hazardous material, and no unauthorized discharge has been confirmed by other means, permittee shall have five working days to determine whether or not there has been an unauthorized discharge. If before the end of such period it is determined that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an entry explaining the occurrence shall be made in the permittee's monitoring records. Where the permittee has not been able, within such period, to determine that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an unauthorized discharge is deemed confirmed and the permittee shall proceed in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section. 
(B)  Test Results. Whenever any test results suggest a possible unauthorized discharge, and no unauthorized discharge has been confirmed by other means, the permittee shall have five working days to retest. If the second test results obtained within that period establish that there has been no unauthorized discharge, the results of both tests shall be recorded in the permittee's monitoring records. If it has not been established within such period that there has been no unauthorized discharge, an unauthorized discharge is deemed confirmed and the permittee shall proceed in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section. 
(b)  Gases at STP. Any person in charge of a storage facility or responsible for emergency response for a storage facility, who has knowledge of any unauthorized discharge of a hazardous material which is a gas at STP, must immediately report such discharge to the city if such discharge presents a threat of imminent danger to public health and safety. 
(c)  No person, firm or corporation shall knowingly or wilfully permit the unauthorized discharge of any hazardous material. 
(Ord. 1862 § 6 (Exh. B)(part), 1992). 
17.06.260 - Cleanup responsibility. 
    Any person, firm or corporation responsible for storing the hazardous material shall institute and complete all actions necessary to remedy the effects of any unauthorized discharge, whether sudden or gradual. The city shall undertake actions to remedy the effects of such unauthorized discharge itself, only if it determines that it is reasonably necessary under the circumstances for the city to do so. The responsible party shall be liable to reimburse the city for all costs incurred by the city in remedying the effects of such unauthorized discharge, including the costs of fighting fires, to the extent allowed by law. This responsibility is not conditioned upon evidence of wilfulness or negligence of the party storing the hazardous material(s) in causing or allowing such discharge. Any responsible party who undertakes action to remedy the effects of unauthorized discharge(s) shall not be barred by this chapter from seeking to recover appropriate costs and expenditures from other responsible parties except as provided by Section 17.06.270. 
(Ord. 1862 § 6 (Exh. B)(part), 1992). 
17.06.270 - Indemnification. 
    The permittee shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the city against any claim, cause of action, disability, loss, liability, damage, cost or expense, howsoever arising, which occurs by reason of an unauthorized discharge in connection with the permittee's operations under this permit except as arises from the city's sole wilful act or sole active negligence. 
(Ord. 1862 § 6 (Exh. B)(part), 1992).

(Ord. No. 2175, § 3(Att. 6), 2-18-2014) 
18.04.030 - Portions modified. 
    The following sections are either enacted in modification of the California Building Code, adopted by reference or are added in place of those sections, parts and/or provisions of the California Building Code which have not been adopted: 
(a)  (1)  An additional sentence is added to Chapter 1, Division II, Administration Section 114.4, to read: "For penalty clause, see Section 10.50.010 of the Campbell Municipal Code." 
(2)  An additional sentence is added to Chapter 1, Division II, Administration Section 110.6 to read: "Approvals of the Building Division are granted to allow work to proceed and are not necessarily for code compliance. See Section 104.11."

"The building official may authorize refunding of any fee paid hereunder which was erroneously paid or collected. 
The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a permit issued in accordance with this code. 
The building official may authorize refunding of not more than 80 percent of the plan review fee paid when an application for a permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done. 
The building official shall not authorize refunding of any fee paid except on written application filed by the original permit holder not later than 180 days after the date of fee payment." 
(c)  Section 1905.1.7, ACI 318 Section 14.1.4 shall be replaced with the following: 
14.1.4 - Plain concrete in structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D, E or F. 
14.1.4.1 - Structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D, E or F shall not have elements of structural plain concrete, except as follows: 
(a)  Isolated footings of plain concrete supporting pedestals or columns are permitted, provided the projection of the footing beyond the face of the supported member does not exceed the footing thickness. 
Exception: In detached one- and two-family dwelling three stories or less in height, the projection of the footing beyond the face of the supported member is permitted to exceed the footing thickness. 
(b)  Plain concrete footing supporting walls are permitted, provided the footings have at least two continuous longitudinal reinforcing bars. Bars shall not be smaller than No. 4 and shall have a total area of not less than 0.002 times the gross cross-sectional area of the footing. A minimum of one bar shall be provided at the top and bottom of the footing. Continuity of reinforcement shall be provided at corners and intersections. 
Exception: In detached one- and two-family dwellings three stories or less in height and constructed with stud bearing walls, plain concrete footings with at least two continuous longitudinal reinforcing bars not smaller than No. 4 are permitted to have a total area of less than 0.002 times the gross cross-sectional area of the footing. 
RATIONALE: 
The proposed amendment addresses the problem of poor performance of plain concrete or under-reinforced concrete footings during a seismic event. This amendment reflects the recommendations by the Structural Engineers Association of Southern California (SEACSC) and the Los Angeles City Joint Task Force that investigated the poor performance of plain and under-reinforced concrete footing observed in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
(d)  Section 1705.3 Concrete Construction. Shall be modified to read: 
1705.3 Concrete construction. The special inspections and verifications for concrete construction shall be as required by this section and Table 1705.3

1.  Isolated spread concrete footings of buildings three stories or less above grade plane that are fully supported on earth or rock, where the structural design of the footing is based on a specific compressive strength, f"c, no greater than 2,500 pounds per square inch (psi) (17.2 Mpa). 
RATIONALE: 
Results from studies after the 1994 Northridge earthquake indicated that a lot of the damages were attributed to lack of quality control during construction. The proposed amendment improves quality control during construction and therefore needs to be incorporated into the Code. Revise CBC Section 1705.3 exception No.1 to allow special inspection not to be required for isolated spread footing where the structural design of the footing is based on a specified compressive strength, f'c, no greater than 2,500 psi. This proposed amendment is a continuation of an amendment adopted during a previous code adoption cycle. 
(e)  Section R602.10.4 and Table R602.10.3(3) (2016 CRC). Add a new footnote "f" to the end of CRC Table R602.10.3(3) , to read: 
f.  In Seismic Design Categories D 0 , D 1 , and D 2 , Method GB is not permitted and the use of Method PCP is limited to one-story single family dwellings and accessory structures. 
Add the "f" footnote notation in the title of Table R602.10.3(3) to read: 
TABLE R602.10.3(3) e[f] 
Add a new subsection R602.10.4.4, to read:

A.  The following words and phrases as used in this section are defined as follows: 
    "Electronic submittal" means the utilization of one or more of the following: 
1.  e-mail 
2.  the internet 
3.  facsimile 
    "Small residential rooftop solar energy systems" means all of the following: 
1.  A solar energy system that is no larger than ten kilowatts alternating current nameplate rating or thirty kilowatts thermal. 
2.  A solar energy system that conforms to all applicable state fire, structural, electrical, and other building codes as adopted or amended by the City and paragraph (iii) of subdivision (c) of Section 714 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time. 
3.  A solar energy system that is installed on a single or duplex family dwelling. 
4.  A solar panel or module array that does not exceed the maximum legal building height as defined by the authority having jurisdiction. 
    "Solar energy system" has the same meaning set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 801.5 of the Civil Code, as such section or subdivision may be amended, renumbered, or redesignated from time to time. 
B.  Section 65850.5 of the California Government Code provides that in developing an expedited permitting process for small residential rooftop solar energy systems, the City shall adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt such checklist. 
C.  The Checklist shall be published on the city's internet website. The applicant may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the City's building division by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature, unless the City specifies in writing the reasons for its inability to accept electronic signatures. 
D.  Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall: 
1.  Verify to the applicant's reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wined, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and 
2.  At the applicant's cost, verify to the applicant's reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system's current use, to carry all new photo-voltaic electrical loads 
E.  For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and fire chief. However, a separate fire inspection may be performed if the City does not have an agreement in place with your local fire authority to conduct a fire safety inspection on behalf of the fire authority. If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however the subsequent inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection. 
F.  An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the building official, shall be deemed complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. 
G.  Upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the building official shall administratively approve the application and issue all required permits or authorizations. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the local utility provider's electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from the local utility provider.

    A parcel map shall be filed and recorded for any subdivision for which a tentative and final map is not required by the Subdivision Map Act except for subdivisions created by short-term leases (terminable by either part on not more than thirty days notice in writing) of a portion of an operating right-of- way of a railroad corporation defined as such by Section 230 of the Public Utilities Code; provided, however, that upon a showing made to the planning director based upon substantial evidence that public policy necessitates such a map, this exception shall not apply. 
    Such maps shall meet all requirements of the Subdivision Map Act and of this title and shall show all dedications or offers of dedication thereon. 
    The community development director may require that such dedications or offers of dedication be made by deed in lieu of or in addition to appearing on the map. 
(Ord. 1619 § 1(part), 1986). 
(Ord. No. 2225, § 4, 8-15-2017) 
20.16.020 - Tentative parcel map. 
    When a parcel map is required by this title, a tentative parcel map shall first be filed with the director of public works. Said map shall meet all the requirements for tentative maps provided by the Subdivision Map Act and this title. 
(Ord. 1619 § 1 (part), 1986). 
20.16.030 - Action on tentative parcel maps. 
    The community development director shall approve or deny an application to subdivide lands into four or fewer lots. Applications therefor shall be accepted only upon payment of a fee in an amount prescribed by resolution of the City Council. 
    Before approval or conditional approval may be given, such subdivision must be considered by the city engineer. 
    All conditions required by the city engineer shall be incorporated in the community development director's conditional approval. Denial by the city engineer shall require denial of the tentative map. 
    All lots created by such subdivision shall have frontage upon a street dedicated as a public street, provided that the community development director may approve not more than one lot without such required frontage on a public street, hereinafter referred to as "rear lot," under the following conditions: 
(1)  The front lot shall meet all of the requirements of the zoning district within which it is located. 
(2)  The rear lot shall meet all of the requirements of the zoning district within which it is located and, in addition, shall have an area which exceeds the lot area requirement by ten percent exclusive of any access to a public street. 
(3)  Access to the public street for a rear lot shall not be over an easement but over land under the same ownership as that of rear lot; such access shall have a minimum width of fifteen feet and shall have a paved way not less than ten feet in width. 
(4)  The creation of a rear lot would be consistent with all applicable specific plans and/or area plans. 
    The community development director shall have authority in granting such application to impose such conditions as are deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood consistent with the general purpose and intent of this title, including, but not limited to, adequate provisions for fire protection, easements for public utilities and improvements of all proposed streets to the standard prescribed in Title 11 or such lesser standards as may be approved by the community development director. 
    Before such subdivision is approved, the applicant shall pay all unpaid county and municipal taxes except taxes not yet payable. 
    A denial of such application may be appealed by the applicant to the planning commission within ten days after the mailing of notice of the decision of the community development director to the applicant at the address shown on the application. 
    The appeal shall be in writing, shall be filed with the secretary of the planning commission, shall generally set forth the grounds of appeal and shall be accompanied by a filing fee in accord with the schedule of fees as established by the City Council, no part of which is refundable. 
    In any case, where the planning commission grants approval subject to conditions, said conditions shall be fulfilled within twenty-four months after the decision of the planning commission, or within such time as the planning commission may prescribe. If all of the conditions are not fulfilled within such period, the application and any approval thereof shall automatically be void and no building permit or other permit issued by the city shall be issued to be used upon or with respect to the subdivision as approved until a new application has been made and approved as provided in this section. Prior to the fulfillment of all of the conditions, no building or other such permit shall be issued during the twenty-four-month period for any structure or use which would not qualify for a permit in the event the approval should become void under this section unless a proper bond is posted guaranteeing fulfillment of such conditions.

2.  Part of, or contiguous to an existing or proposed commercial, industrial, mixed use or office development exceeding twenty acres in total site area, and is integrated with said development through common access easements or other aspects of integrated site design; and 
B.  Permanent vehicular and pedestrian access is assured through recordation of reciprocal ingress/egress easements for all parcels within the subdivision boundary, including access rights for all property owners, guests, employees, clients and customers of all business entities or tenants lawfully located within the subdivision boundary; and 
C.  Each independent parcel is self-sufficient in terms of parking requirements to serve the existing or proposed uses on the parcel unless off-site parking is assured through permanent parking easements located nearby (within three hundred feet of the building's or center's public entrance) on adjoining parcels; and 
D.  Utility connections are located within easements benefitting the independent parcels which exist or are proposed within the subdivision; and 
E.  The subdivision will not disrupt or delay the provision of street improvements; and 
F.  Covenants shall be recorded which obligate existing and future property owners to jointly provide for street improvements, as required by Chapter 11.24 of this code, or condition of subdivision approval, and to participate in any assessment district which might be formed for the purpose of installation of said street improvements; and 
G.  Covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs) shall be recorded which ensure the joint development of landscape improvements along the public street perimeter of all parcels within the subdivision boundaries; and 
H.  The subdivision CC&Rs shall establish a property owners association for the joint maintenance of reciprocal rights of way and perimeter landscape areas; and 
I.  In instances when more than one of the proposed parcels will remain under one ownership, the above easements and/or covenants shall be placed in escrow and recorded simultaneously with any transfer of ownership of any of the affected parcels, at no cost to the city. 
(Ord. 1823, 1990).

    The public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that four acres of property be devoted and developed for park and recreational purposes for each one thousand persons currently residing or who may in the future reside within the city, as determined in the open space element of the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.050 - Standards and formula for dedication of land. 
(a)  Dedication Requirement. The subdivider shall provide park lands and park improvements sufficient to serve the residents of the subdivision. The subdivider shall dedicate and improve three acres of park land for every one thousand persons projected to reside in the subdivision pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Acreage Formula. The formula for determining the amount of acreage to be dedicated and improved for recreation purposes or the equivalent fee to be paid shall be as follows: 
Number of 
additional units × Average number of 
persons per unit × 3 acres 
1,000 population Example of a six-lot single-family subdivision:  
6 parcels × 3.14 persons × 
per parcel 3.0 acres per 1,000 persons = .05652 acres  
(c)  Subdivisions Allowing More Than One Unit Per Parcel. In the event that land is proposed for subdivision within a zoning district that allows more than one dwelling unit per parcel then the park land dedication formula shall be applied using the maximum number of units permitted by the zoning classification of the property, unless development on the land to be subdivided is constrained by a zoning restriction or development approval and the density limitation is reflected as a condition of approving the tentative and final map, in which case the number of units shall be that number set forth in the conditions of approval of the tentative map or other development approval. 
(d)  Mixed Use Subdivisions. Subdivisions which allow residential units mixed on the same parcel with nonresidential units shall dedicate land and/or pay a fee based on the park acreage formula using the average number of persons expected in the six to thirteen dwelling unit per acre density range, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city council at the time of tentative map approval that the unit size and characteristics anticipated for the residential units are more similar to one of the other residential dwelling unit density classifications and the subdivided site is constrained by a development approval which limits the number and type of residential units, in which case the city council shall determine the probable number of persons per unit to be used to calculate the acreage formula. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.060 - Persons per unit. 
    For purposes of the formulas set forth in this chapter, the number of people projected to occupy the subdivision and the resulting acreage requirement per dwelling unit, as established by the most recent available federal census, is as follows: 
Acreage Requirements by Density 
Dwelling Unit 
Density per 
Gross Acre Persons 
per Unit Acreage Requirement 
per Unit Based on 3 
Acres/1,000 Persons Less than 6 3.14 .00942 6-less than 13 2.01 .00603 13-less than 21 1.89 .00567 More than 21 and 
secondary living units 1.61 .00483 Mixed-use subdivisions (See Section 20.24.050(d))  
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.070 - Determination of land dedication or fee. 
(a)  Recreational Facility Within the Subdivision. Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the open space element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future need of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall dedicate land for a park. 
(b)  No Recreational Facility Within the Subdivision. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the open space element of the general plan to be located in whole or part within the proposed subdivision, the city may either require dedication and improvement of land for park use and/or payment of a fee in lieu of dedicating land and providing improvements. 
(c)  Subdivisions With Fifty Parcels or More. Where a proposed subdivision containing fifty parcels or more lies in an area not then included within the city's general plan for park or recreational use, the city shall determine whether to require dedication and improvement or a fee in lieu of dedication and improvement, in accordance with the criteria developed pursuant to the implementation measures set forth in the open space element of the general plan. 
(d)  Subdivisions With Fifty Parcels or Less. Not-withstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, only the payment of fees shall be required in subdivisions containing fifty parcels or less, rather than dedication of land and provisions of improvements in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.24.080; provided, however, that when a condominium project, stock cooperative or community apartment project exceeds fifty dwelling units, dedication of land and provisions of improvements may be required when the number of parcels is fifty or less, in accordance with the criteria of subsections (a), (b) and (e) of this section. 
(e)  No Criteria or Sites Within Open Space Element. If no criteria or specific sites for parks have been identified in the open space element of the city's general plan, the city council shall determine whether to require dedication of land, or payment of an in-lieu fee based on the following factors: 
(1)  The appropriateness of the topography, geology, access and location for park or recreational use; 
(2)  The size and shape of the subdivision and whether land available for dedication is suitable for park or recreational use; 
(3)  The availability of existing or previously acquired park property to serve the area where the subdivision is located; 
(4)  The availability of other nearby or adjoining property for consolidation as park land. 
(f)  Land Dedication Satisfying the Requirement. If unimproved land is dedicated in lieu of providing the park improvements required by this chapter, the subdivider shall dedicate sufficient additional land of equivalent value to the value of the improvements that would otherwise have been required, or pay an equivalent fee, at the discretion of the city council. 
(g)  Council Determination. The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated or a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.080 - Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. 
    Where a fee is required to be paid in whole or in part for park purposes, the amount of such fee shall be computed as follows: 
(a)  The city council shall set the fees by resolution, in accordance with the terms of this section. 
(b)  Amount of Fee. The amount of the fee shall be no greater than the fair market value of commercial and residential land within the city on a per acre basis, multiplied times the acreage of land required to be dedicated pursuant to this chapter, plus the total cost of improvements necessary to develop such property for park and recreation purposes. 
(c)  Determining Fair Market Value. The city manager or his/her designee shall determine the fair market value of residential land, as defined in Section 20.24.020(f) of this chapter, on a per acre basis and the cost of park improvements in the city, and this determination shall be used in determining the maximum amount of the fee. 
(d)  Partial In-Lieu Fee Payment. Payment of an in-lieu fee shall be required for any subdivision that does not dedicate and improve sufficient land to satisfy the requirements of Section 20.24.050 of this chapter. The difference between the dedication standard and the amount of land dedicated shall be paid as an in-lieu fee, as defined in this chapter. When a full or partial fee is required, the park acreage standard not satisfied by land dedication shall be multiplied times the cost of land and improvements to determine the amount of the fee. 
(Ord. 2058 § 1(part), 2005: Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.090 - Timing of fee payment or dedication of land. 
    Any new subdivision of property for residential purposes shall dedicate the land or pay the fee prior to recordation of the final subdivision map. The amount of the dedication or fee obligation shall be calculated in accordance with the "number of persons per unit" in effect at the time that land is dedicated to the city or the fee payment is received by the city. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.100 - Use of fees and/or dedicated land. 
    The revenue raised by payment of the fees or dedication of land imposed by this chapter shall be used to provide the parks and park improvements specified in the general plan. 
(a)  Use of Money. The money collected under this chapter shall be placed in a special revenue fund which is created and which shall be known as the park dedication in-lieu fund. Moneys within this fund shall be used and expended solely for the acquisition, improvement, expansion or implementation of parks and recreational facilities of the city. 
(b)  Use of Dedicated Land. Land dedicated pursuant to this chapter shall be used to provide the parks and park improvements specified in the general plan of the city. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.110 - Credits. 
    Credits against the park land dedication requirements shall be granted for the following: 
(a)  Previous Dedications and Existing Legally Constructed Units. 
(1)  Any dedications or payments of fees previously made to the city for park and recreation purposes under this chapter, for any existing legal lot of record within the proposed subdivision shall be credited against any dedication or fee imposed on the subdivision under this chapter. 
(2)  Existing legally constructed units within the proposed subdivision shall be counted as a credit against the fee or dedication requirements applicable to developments at the density rate of the existing dwellings, up to a maximum of one hundred percent of the park land obligation. 
(b)  Private Open Space. Partial credits of up to fifty percent of the park dedication requirements shall be granted for subdivisions and developments which provide open space which is privately owned and maintained and which meet all of the following requirements: 
(1)  Yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required to be maintained by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; 
(2)  Private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance or restrictions; 
(3)  Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without consent of the city or its successor; 
(4)  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; 
(5)  The facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the open space element of the general plan; and 
(6)  That the open space for which credit is given provides a minimum of five of the local park basic elements listed below: 
Minimum Acres (A) Children play apparatus area .50 (B) Landscape park-like and quiet areas .50 (C) Family picnic area .25 (D) Game court area .25 (E) Turf playfield 1.00 (F) Swim pool and adjacent areas .25 (G) Recreation center building .15

    The subdivider or developer of a project subject to a dedication or fee pursuant to this chapter may appeal to the city council for a reduction or adjustment to that requirement, or a waiver based on the following: 
(a)  Affordable Housing. The city council may grant a full or partial waiver of the fee or dedication requirements of this chapter whenever the city council finds that such waiver would advance the provisions of affordable housing identified as necessary under the housing element of the city's general plan or pursuant to Section 21.62.040 (Density bonus provisions) of this code, provided such waivers do not significantly impair the city's ability to meet the goals identified in the open space element of the general plan. 
(b)  Additional Grounds for Waiver or Reduction. The subdivider or developer of a project subject to a dedication or fee pursuant to this chapter may appeal to the city council for a reduction or adjustment to that requirement, or a waiver on any of the following grounds: 
(1)  The amount or location of the land to be dedicated does not bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision or development; 
(2)  The fees to be paid do not bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision or development; 
(3)  The determination of the fair market value of commercial or residential property or recreational facilities in the city by the city manager or his/her designee is unreasonable, as applied to the applicant's development or property; 
(4)  The credits provided in Section 20.24.110 have not been applied as provided therein. 
(c)  Waivers are Cumulative. The waivers provided herein are cumulative, and do not supersede or supplant one another, provided however that the total of such credits, waivers and exemptions shall not exceed the fee or dedication required by this chapter. 
(d)  Timing of Request for Waiver or Appeal. The request for waiver or appeal shall be made in writing to the city clerk not later than ten days after approval of a tentative subdivision map or if no tentative map is required, then from the time of the filing of a request for approval of a final subdivision map. The written request for waiver or appeal shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver or reduction. 
(e)  Appeal or Waiver Hearing. The city council shall consider the application for waiver or appeal at a hearing held within sixty days after the filing of a written request. The decision of the city council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment, or waiver is granted, any change in use or number of parcels within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.130 - Schedule of improvements. 
    The city shall annually develop a schedule specifying how and when it will use the land or fees or both to develop park or recreational facilities. Said schedule may consist of the city's capital improvement program and/or operating budget. Any fees collected under the requirements of Section 20.24.080 shall be committed within five years after the payment of such fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If such fees are not committed, they shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1905 § 2(part), 1994). 
20.24.140 - Apartment conversions. 
    The provisions of this chapter do not apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of air-space in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old, when no new dwelling units are added.

Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the Subdivision Ordinance shall apply to the Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance. 
    To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development, by protecting the property rights of the citizens of the city of Campbell and state of California as established by general law inconsistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by the Zoning Ordinance or other applicable provisions of the Municipal Code.

(b)  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
(Ord. 1619 § 1(part), 1986). 
20.32.060 - Filing and processing. 
    A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same from and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the Campbell Subdivision Ordinance for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:

(2)  Height, size, and location of buildings; 
(3)  Sewer, water, storm drain and road details; 
(4)  Information on the uses to which the buildings will be put. 
(Ord. 1619 § 1(part), 1986).

    However, if Section 66474.2 of the government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
(1)  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community or both, in condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
(2)  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
(c)  The rights referred to in this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 20.26.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
(1)  An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. 
(2)  The initial time period set forth in subsection (c)(1) shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed.

(a)  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 20.32.090(a), confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
(b)  The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 20.32.090(c). 
(Ord. 1619 § 1(part), 1986).

    Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in 20.32.090(a) and 20.32.100, and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

In no event shall the director of public works authorize a release of the improvement security which would reduce such security to an amount below that required to guarantee the completion of the act or work and any other obligation imposed by this ordinance, the Subdivision Map Act or the improvement agreement. 
(c)  Security given to secure payment to the contractor, his subcontractors and to persons furnishing labor, materials or equipment, may, six months after the completion and acceptance of the act or work, be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of all claims therefor filed and of which notice has been given to the legislative body, plus an amount reasonably determined by the city council (director of public works/city engineer or other designee) to be required to assure the performance of any other obligations secured thereby.

(c)  If the building official has knowledge of, or the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soil investigation of each lot in the subdivision shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the state. The report shall recommend corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed on each lot in the subdivision.

(Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.01.050 - Applicability of Zoning Code. 
    This Zoning Code applies to all land uses, structures, subdivisions, and development within the City of Campbell, as provided by this section. 
A.  New land uses or structures, changes to land uses or structures. Compliance with the requirements of Chapter 21.03.020 (General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses) or, where applicable, Chapter 21.58 (Nonconforming Uses and Structures), is necessary for any person or public agency to lawfully maintain, alter, construct, establish, reconstruct, or replace any use of land or structure. 
B.  Issuance of building or grading permits. The community development department may issue building, construction, or grading permits only when: 
1.  The proposed land use or structure satisfies the requirements of Subsection (A) of this section, and all other applicable ordinances, regulations, and statutes; and 
2.  The city engineer determines that the site was subdivided in compliance with Title 20 (Subdivision and Land Development) of the Campbell Municipal Code. 
C.  Subdivision of land. Any subdivision of land proposed within the city after the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be consistent with the minimum parcel size requirements of Article 2 (Zoning Districts), all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Code, and the city's subdivision regulations. 
D.  Continuation of an existing land use. An existing land use is lawful only when it was legally established in compliance with all applicable regulations, and when it is operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code, including Chapter 21.58 (Nonconforming Uses and Structures). 
    Existing land uses that were in violation of city zoning regulations applicable before the effective date of this Zoning Code are in violation of this Zoning Code. These uses shall continue to be in violation unless they conform to the current provisions of this Zoning Code, except as otherwise provided in this Zoning Code. 
E.  Effect of Zoning Code changes on projects in progress. A land use permit application that has been accepted by the community development department as complete before the effective date of this Zoning Code or any amendment shall be processed in compliance with the requirements in effect when the application was accepted as complete. 
F.  Minimum requirements. The provisions of this Zoning Code shall be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When this Zoning Code provides for discretion on the part of a city official or body, that discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements than identified in this Zoning Code as may be necessary to promote orderly land use development and the purposes of this Zoning Code, provided that such requirements do not exceed the authority otherwise residing in the city official or body. 
G.  Other requirements may still apply. Nothing in this Zoning Code eliminates the need for obtaining any permit, approval, or entitlement required by other provisions of the Campbell Municipal Code or complying with the regulations of any city department, or any county, regional, State, or Federal agency. 
H.  Conflicting requirements. Any conflicts between different requirements of this Zoning Code, or between this Zoning Code and other regulations, shall be resolved in compliance with Subsection 21.02.020(E) (Rules of Interpretation).

The present tense includes the past and future tenses; and the future tense includes the present. The singular number includes the plural number, and the plural the singular, unless the natural construction of the word indicates otherwise. The words "include," "includes," and "including" mean "including but not limited to..." and the word "used" includes the words "arranged for, designed for, occupied, or intended to be occupied for." 
2.  Abbreviated titles and phrases. For the purpose of brevity, and unless otherwise indicated, the following phrases, names of personnel, and decision making bodies are shortened in this Zoning Code in the following manner: 
    The City of Campbell is referred to as the "city."

    The California Subdivision Map Act is referred to as the "Map Act." 
    The United States Federal Government is referred to as "Federal." 
3.  Number of days. Whenever a number of days is specified in this Zoning Code, or in any permit, condition of approval, or notice issued or given in compliance with this Zoning Code, the number of days shall be construed as calendar days, unless business days are specified. Time limits will extend to the following business day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a day that the city is not open for business, except as otherwise provided for by the Map Act. 
4.  State law requirements. Where this Zoning Code references applicable provisions of State law (e.g., the California Government Code, Subdivision Map Act, Public Resources Code, etc.), the reference shall be construed to be to the applicable State law provisions as they may be amended from time to time. 
D.  Calculations-Rounding. Where provisions of this Zoning Code require calculations to determine applicable requirements, any fractional/decimal results of the calculations shall be rounded in compliance with this subsection. 
1.  Minimum parcel area and number of parcels. The fractional/decimal results of calculations of the number of housing units allowed within a zoning district shall be rounded down to the next whole number. 
2.  Residential density. The fractional/decimal results of calculations of the number of housing units allowed within a zoning district shall be rounded down to the next whole number. 
3.  All other calculations. For all calculations required by this Zoning Code other than those described in subparagraphs (D)(1) and (D)(2) above, the fractional/decimal results of calculations shall be rounded to the next highest whole number when the fraction/decimal is 0.5 or more, and to the next lowest whole number when the fraction is less than 0.5, unless otherwise specified. 
E.  Conflicting requirements. Any conflicts between different requirements of this Zoning Code, or between this Zoning Code and other regulations, shall be resolved as follows: 
1.  Zoning Code provisions. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Zoning Code, the most restrictive requirement shall control; 
2.  Development agreements, overlay district, area plan, neighborhood plan, or specific plans. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of this Zoning Code and standards adopted as part of any development agreement, overlay district, area plan, neighborhood plan, or specific plan, the requirements of the development agreement, overlay district, area plan, neighborhood plan, or specific plan shall control; 
3.  Municipal Code provisions. In the event of any conflict between requirements of this Zoning Code and other regulations of the city, the most restrictive shall control; and 
4.  Private agreements. It is not intended that the requirements of this Zoning Code shall interfere with, repeal, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant, or other agreement that existed when this Zoning Code became effective. This Zoning Code applies to all land uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the development or use of structures or land than an applicable private agreement or restriction, without affecting the applicability of any agreement or restriction. The city shall not enforce any private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement. 
F.  Allowable uses of land. If a proposed use of land is not specifically listed in Article 2 (Zoning Districts) the use shall not be allowed, except as follows: 
1.  Similar uses allowed. The community development director may determine that a proposed use not listed in Article 2 or specified by a master use permit authorized by section 21.14.030.C (Master use permit) may be allowed as a permitted or conditional use, or is not allowed. A determination by the community development director that a use is not allowed may be appealed in compliance with Chapter 21.62 (Appeals). In making this determination, the community development director shall first find that: 
a.  The characteristics of, and activities associated with the proposed use are equivalent to those of one or more of the uses listed in the zoning district as allowable, and will not involve a greater level of activity, dust, intensity, noise, parking, population density, or traffic generation than the uses listed in the zoning district; 
b.  The proposed use will meet the purpose/intent of the zoning district that is applied to the site; and 
c.  The proposed use will be consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan. 
2.  Applicable standards and permit requirements. When the community development director determines that a proposed, but unlisted use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where the use is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this Zoning Code apply. 
G.  Measurement of height and area requirements. When this Zoning Code requires that compliance to a standard is met by specific measurements and there is an ambiguity concerning the measurement, the community development director shall make a determination as to the correct measurement. 
(Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
(Ord. No. 2149, § 1(Exh. A), 6-7-2011; Ord. No. 2213, § 24, 11-1-2016; Ord. No. 2225, § 8, 8-15-2017) 
21.02.030 - Procedures for interpretations.

B.  Planning commission may interpret map. In the event property which is shown as acreage on the zoning map has been or is subsequently subdivided into blocks or parcels by a duly recorded subdivision map and the block or parcel arrangement does not conform to that anticipated when the district boundaries were established, or property is re-subdivided by a duly recorded subdivision map into different arrangement of blocks or parcels than shown on the zoning map, the planning commission, after notice to the owners of the affected property, may interpret the zoning map and make minor readjustments in the district boundaries to carry out the purpose and intent of these regulations and conform to the street and parcel layout on the ground. 
C.  Map shall be changed. The interpretations or adjustments shall be by written decision, and thereafter copies of the zoning map shall be changed to conform to the interpretations. 
(Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.06.050 - Symbol for district. 
    Where one symbol is used on the zoning map to indicate the zoning district classification for an area divided by an alley(s), the symbol shall establish the classification of the whole area. 
(Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.06.060 - Street or right-of-way-Allocation or division. 
A.  Physical improvement.

J.  Development review regulations for projects in the C-3 (Central Business) zoning district. 
1.  Purpose. Downtown Campbell possesses a wealth of small-scale commercial buildings that are architecturally exemplary of the variety of historic periods in which they were constructed. These design standards are intended to both promote the conservation and rehabilitation of buildings and to encourage new building and remodeling which is simultaneously in keeping with existing buildings and architecturally exemplary of contemporary design. In this way the architectural history and richness of downtown will be continued and expanded. 
    Each new building and remodeling project in the downtown shall adhere both in its large- and small-scale parts to the architectural parts or style adopted for the project. Architectural design shall be of high quality, measured against contemporary standards. 
2.  Intent. The guidelines below govern building mass; building form and composition; storefronts; materials, colors and finishes; and other elements. They are intended to encourage the relation of specific project aspects to the designated architectural parts or style. 
3.  Site and Architectural Review required. Buildings and structures in the C-3 (Central Business) zoning district shall conform to the design standards in paragraphs 4-8 below and are subject to approval in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 21.42 (Site and Architectural Review): 
4.  Building mass. 
a.  Large building facades shall be divided into smaller elements to complement the intimate scale created by the existing small property divisions. 
b.  Second floor decks or terraces at the rear of buildings for use by adjacent offices or restaurants should be incorporated whenever practical to add a sense of vitality to the rear building facades. 
c.  Roof design shall be consistent with the building's architectural style. Mansard, shed or residential type roofs are prohibited unless it is demonstrated that such a roof style is structurally or architecturally suitable for the particular project or location. 
d.  The existing residential building types of historical significance should retain their character, including features such as landscaped setbacks. 
5.  Building form and composition. 
a.  Unique and historic building elements such as parapet details and belt courses shall be retained and restored. 
b.  Traditional commercial building forms should be incorporated whenever practical. 
c.  Open air dining areas facing Campbell Avenue should be employed to the greatest extent practical. The buildings should not be set back from the street, but should contain the dining areas within their architectural framework. 
d.  Upper stories in multistory buildings are required to have solid surfaces with vertical rectangular windows, augmented with frames. Glass curtain walls should not be approved unless it is demonstrated that such walls are the only structurally or architecturally suitable form of wall for the particular project or location. 
e.  Architecturally exemplary design of high quality shall be employed. Buildings should not be made to look "old time" unless such design would be clearly more appropriate and harmonious with the purpose of this chapter. 
f.  Buildings shall incorporate base, cornice, and other elements appropriate to their architectural style. 
6.  Storefronts. 
a.  First floor frontages shall have an integrated design including display windows, an entry, and signing. 
b.  The design of the building storefront shall be consistent with the building's architectural style. 
c.  Walls facing pedestrian ways should have elements of visual interest, such as fenestration, displays, signing, or landscaping, unless the effect of such elements would be clearly contrary to the purposes of this chapter. Large areas of blank walls should not be permitted unless it is demonstrated that such blank areas are clearly more appropriate and harmonious than would be the case if elements of visual interest were incorporated. 
d.  Buildings facing Campbell Avenue shall have their primary entries along that street. 
e.  Entries should be recessed, as they add depth to storefront, and act as transition areas between the street and shop interiors, unless the effects of such entries would be clearly contrary to the purposes of this paragraph. 
f.  Doors and windows shall be of clear glass. Unglazed wood doors, screen doors and doors or windows of heavily tinted or reflective glass should not be approved unless it is demonstrated that such doors and windows are the only structurally or architecturally suitable form for the particular project or location. 
g.  Storefront windows shall reflect the building's character. For instance, on 1940's and 50's "showcase" buildings, exposed aluminum frame windows are appropriate. 
h.  Ground floor offices facing Campbell Avenue are required to maintain the same storefront character as retail spaces. 
i.  Awnings on building facades should be employed when appropriate, as they add color, weather protection, and opportunities for signing. As in other architectural elements, the awnings should be designed to reflect the building's geometry. 
7.  Materials, colors, and finishes. 
a.  Primary facade materials shall be limited to those that are characteristic of the building's architectural style. 
b.  Exterior wall finishes shall be smooth and of finished quality, not deliberately rough in an attempt to look antiqued or used. 
c.  Primary building colors shall be characteristic of the building's architectural style. Overly bright, garish, or otherwise offensive colors or color combinations are prohibited. 
d.  Accent materials such as tile bases shall be carefully chosen to complement the building style and coordinate with adjacent buildings.

e.  Painted trim shall coordinate with primary facade colors to add more depth and interest to the buildings. 
f.  A coordinated color scheme that responds to the style of the structure shall be developed for each building. The colors of signing, awnings, planters, accent materials, and primary facade colors should all be considered. The number of colors should be limited. 
8.  Other elements. 
a.  Trash collection and storage areas shall be carefully screened. 
b.  Mechanical equipment shall be screened from view. Exhaust louvers shall not be located in the storefront areas.

1.  Intent. The intent of these regulations is to stimulate creative, good quality signing which will complement the intimate scale and architectural character of the area, and which will complement the architectural style of the building to which the signing is fixed. 
2.  Allowable signs. Each business shall be allowed one square foot of sign area for each one linear foot of business frontage. A minimum of twenty square feet is allowed and a maximum of forty square feet is allowed for each business. 
3.  Sign materials. Appropriate sign materials include enameled metal, painted wood, cast metal, painted fabric, and similar materials. Plastic signs should not be approved unless it is demonstrated that the use of the plastic signs at the proposed location would be more harmonious with the purpose of this paragraph than the foregoing enumerated materials. 
4.  Wall signs. Each business may have one wall sign, except corner businesses, which may have two. This sign shall be located below the top of parapet on single story buildings and below the second floor sill on multistoried buildings. It may be painted directly on a wall, a sign panel attached to a parapet wall, or of individually formed letters attached to a wall. 
5.  Awnings. Awnings may be used in lieu of wall signs. An insignia or name may be painted, silk screened or appliquéd onto the awning. Awnings may project five feet into the public right-of-way on Campbell Avenue and shall maintain a minimum clearance of eight feet from the ground. All other streets shall be limited to a two-foot projection and have a minimum clearance of eight feet. Awnings shall be securely attached to buildings and well maintained. No supports or poles may be located in the public right-of-way. Awning forms shall be carefully chosen to complement the architectural style of the building to which they are fixed.

(Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.16.070 - Noise. 
A.  Purpose. It is declared to be the policy of the city to prohibit unnecessary, excessive, and annoying sound levels from all sources. In compliance with this policy, Campbell is designated a quiet city. At certain levels, sounds are detrimental to the health and welfare of the citizenry and, in the public interest, shall be systematically proscribed. It is the purpose of this chapter to prescribe standards for and to provide an effective and readily available remedy for violations of this chapter. 
B.  Definitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, the words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
    "A-weighting" means a filter network designed to transform a frequency spectrum to that which is heard by the human ear. 
    "Decibel (dB)" means a unit for measuring the amplitude of sound, equal to twenty times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure of zero decibels, which is twenty micropascals. 
    "Impulsive sound" means a sound of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. Examples of impulsive sounds include explosions, drop impacts, and firearm discharge. 
    "Noise" means any loud discordant or disagreeable sound or sounds. 
    "Noise level" expressed in decibels (dB), means a logarithmic indication of the ratio between the acoustic energy present at a given location and the lowest amount of acoustic energy audible to sensitive human ears and weighted by frequency to account for characteristics of human hearing, as given in the American National Standards Institute Standard S1.1, Acoustic Terminology, Paragraph 2.9, or successor references. 
    "Noise level measurement" means the procedure of measuring sound consisting of the usage of a precision sound level meter (SLM), as defined in this section, set to "fast" response. If the sound level meter is analog with a VU meter, then the response shall be "slow" unless the noise issue is impulsive. The meter shall be calibrated before any measurements and the microphone shall be a minimum of three and one-half feet from any wall, floor, or other large sound-reflecting surface. The meter shall be protected from wind or other extraneous noise by the use of screens, shields, or other appropriate devices. 
    "Powered equipment" means a motorized device powered by electricity or fuel used for property maintenance and/or landscape maintenance. Powered equipment includes: lawn mowers, edgers, parking lot sweepers, blowers, wood chippers, vacuums, and similar devices. 
    "Precision sound level meter" means a sound pressure level measuring instrument that conforms to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) specification S1.4 for Type 1 or Type 2 measuring instruments. 
    "Sensitive receptor" means a land use in which there is a reasonable degree of sensitivity to noise. Such uses include single-family and multi-family residential uses, schools, hospitals, churches, rest homes, cemeteries, public libraries, and other sensitive uses as determined by the enforcement officer. 
C.  Applicability. It is unlawful for any person, at any location within the city, to create any noise or to allow the creation of any noise on property leased, occupied, owned, or otherwise controlled by the person which does not comply with the provisions of this chapter, unless the provisions of either subsection E or subsection G of this section, have been met. 
D.  Noise measurement. 
1.  Noise measurement equipment. Any noise measurement made in compliance with this chapter shall be made with a sound level meter using the A-weighting network at slow meter response. Fast meter response shall be used for impulsive type noise. Calibration of the measurement equipment utilizing an acoustical calibrator meeting American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards shall be performed immediately prior to recording any sound data. 
2.  Location of noise measurement. Exterior sound levels shall be measured at the property line or at any location within the property of the affected sensitive receptor. Sound measurements shall be taken in a manner and location so that it can be determined whether sound level standards are exceeded at the property line. Where practical, the microphone of the sound level meter shall be positioned three to five feet above the ground and away from reflective surfaces. The actual location of the sound measurements shall be at the discretion of the enforcement officer. 
E.  Residential noise standards. 
1.  Noise from stationary sources. New residential development shall conform to a stationary source noise exposure standard of sixty-five dBA for exterior noise levels and forty-five dBA for interior noise levels. 
2.  Traffic-related noise. New residential development shall conform to a traffic-related noise exposure standard of sixty dBA CNEL for outdoor noise in noise-sensitive outdoor activity areas and forty-five dBA CNEL for indoor noise. New development that does not and cannot be made to conform to this standard shall not be allowed. 
F.  Acoustical studies required. 
1.  Acoustical studies. Acoustical studies are required for all new noise-sensitive projects that may be affected by existing noise from stationary sources, including all new residential developments with a noise exposure greater than 60 dBA CNEL. The studies shall also satisfy the requirements set forth in Title 24, Part 2, of the California Administrative Code, Noise Insulation Standards, for multiple-family attached residential projects, hotels, motels, etc., regulated by Title 24. 
2.  Mitigation measures. Where acoustical studies show that existing stationary noise sources exceed, or will exceed maximum allowable noise levels, mitigation shall be identified to reduce noise exposure to or below the allowable levels of this chapter. Mitigation measures may include increased setbacks between uses, earth berms, sound walls, landscaping, and site design that shields noise-sensitive uses with nonsensitive structures, (e.g., parking lots, utility areas and garages), or orientation of buildings to shield outdoor spaces from noise sources. In cases where sound walls are used as mitigation, they should be encouraged to help create an attractive setting with features such as setbacks, changes in alignment, detail and texture, pedestrian access (if appropriate) and landscaping. 
G.  Exemptions. Sound or noise emanating from the following sources and activities are exempt from the provisions of this chapter: 
1.  Municipal Code provisions. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply where noise standards are specified elsewhere in the Municipal Code. 
2.  City parks. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to city-sanctioned recreational activities/programs conducted in public parks. 
3.  Safety, warning, and alarm devices. Safety, warning, and alarm devices, including house and car alarms, and other warning devices that are designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare, provided the devices are not negligently maintained or operated.

(Ord. No. 2225, § 11, 8-15-2017) 
21.18.080 - Hazardous materials. 
    This section provides guidelines for the regulation of hazardous materials for the protection of health, safety, and welfare of persons, resources, and property. 
A.  Setbacks required. Any person, firm, or corporation that stores, handles, or dispenses any hazardous material shall provide the necessary setbacks (buffer zones) along property lines and between buildings in compliance with the uniform building code and uniform fire code. 
B.  Change in use. Projects that involve a change in land use from industrial to residential or commercial shall provide detailed information regarding potential historical hazardous materials uses, including soil and/or groundwater sampling results, if warranted. 
C.  Hazardous materials management plan (HMMP). Any person, firm, or corporation who proposes to store, handle, or dispense any hazardous material within the hazardous thresholds defined by the UBC and UFC and within five hundred feet of any school or property zoned for residential use shall submit a HMMP to the community development department for review and approval. 
D.  Disclosure. As part of all development applications, the applicant shall complete a hazardous waste and substance sites disclosure form certifying that they have reviewed the current CAL-EPA hazardous waste and substances sites list available in the community development department. 
E.  Information required. Applications for discretionary development projects that will generate, use or store hazardous materials shall provide detailed information regarding waste reduction, recycling and storage. 
F.  City review. The type of review required is dependant on the location of the subject site and the type and volume of hazardous materials being used. At the discretion of the community development director, the building official, or the fire marshall, the applicant shall submit a written hazardous materials management plan (HMMP) for approval by the city. The HMMP shall include detailed information regarding the safe storage, handling, recycling, and waste reduction of hazardous or other regulated materials, a transportation plan for using city streets to transport hazardous materials, and an emergency response plan in the event of a reportable release or threatened release of a hazardous or other regulated material. The emergency response plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Procedures for the immediate notification to city, to the county fire department, and to the State Office of Emergency Services; 
2.  Procedures for the mitigation of a release or threatened release to minimize any potential harm or damage to persons, property, or the environment;

(Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.18.090 - Lighting design standards. 
A.  Exterior lighting. Exterior lighting shall be: 
1.  Architecturally integrated with the character of the structure(s); 
2.  Energy-efficient, and fully shielded or recessed; and 
3.  Completely turned off or significantly dimmed at the close of business hours when the exterior lighting is not essential for security and safety, when located on parcels within nonresidential zoning districts. 
B.  Permanent lighting. Permanently installed lighting shall not blink, flash, or be of unusually high intensity or brightness. Lighting fixtures shall be appropriate in height, intensity, and scale to the use they are serving. 
C.  Shielding requirements. Outdoor lighting fixtures shall be designed and installed so that light rays are not emitted across property lines, to the extent possible. Fixtures like the "shoe box" design are capable of providing accurate light patterns and can be used for lighting parking lots without spilling onto the neighboring property. 

Figure 3-4
D.  Design criteria. 
1.  External light fixtures, poles, and their foundation should be simple in design and compatible with and complimentary to the style of surrounding development. Historical-themed fixtures are not appropriate for a contemporary building design and modern fixtures are not appropriate for a structure with a significant historical design theme. Simple and functional designs are considered to be appropriate in most environments. Lighting standards should be of a scale that is compatible with their surroundings. Pedestrian-style lighting (three to five feet high) should be installed in areas where foot traffic is prevalent. Lighting fixtures for parking lots and private roadways should not be installed at a height greater than twenty feet. 
2.  Color-corrected lamps of appropriate intensity should be used in exterior lighting. High-efficiency lamps that alter the colors of objects at night are discouraged. Incandescent, fluorescent, color-corrected sodium vapor and mercury lamps should be used because they provide light with an appropriate color spectrum. 
3.  Lighting intensity should be the minimum required to serve the tasks for which the fixtures are intended. 
4.  Exterior lighting should be considerate of both the neighbors and the community as a whole. Each new lighting scheme should actively strive to reduce negative light impacts. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.18.100 - Nonresidential open space and recreational facilities. 
    This section provides standards and incentives for the provision of open space and recreational facilities in nonresidential projects.

1.  Wall height. An opaque screen consisting of plant material and a solid masonry wall or wooden fence, not less than six feet in height, shall be installed along parcel boundaries whenever a commercial or industrial development adjoins a residential zoning district and whenever a multi-family zoning district adjoins a single-family residential zoning district. A fence or wall taller than six feet in height may be allowed in compliance with Section 21.18.060, (Fences, walls, lattice, and screens). 
2.  Architectural compatibility. The method of screening shall be architecturally compatible with the other on-site development in terms of colors, materials, architectural style, and shall include appropriately installed and maintained landscaping, as applicable. 
3.  Pedestrian access. Pedestrian access may be provided through the required wall or fence. 
4.  Waiver. The decision-making body may waive or change the requirement for a screen wall/fence if the development plan adequately provides for the integration of different adjacent land uses in a way that avoids conflicts between the different uses; an existing wall or fence is in place that meets or could be modified to meet the intent of this section; or a lesser screening is appropriate due to the nature of the adjoining uses. 

Figure 3-5 
Screening and Buffering Between Two Different Uses

(Ord. 2102 § 1(part), 2008). 
(Ord. No. 2206, § 5, 8-2-2016) 
21.20.100 - Calculation of density bonus. 
1.  When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next larger whole number. 
2.  The density bonus units shall not be included in the "total units" when determining the number of target units required to qualify a residential project for a density bonus pursuant to Section 21.20.040(1) or (2). When calculating the required number of target units, any calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next larger whole number. 
3.  The applicant may request a lesser density bonus than the project is entitled to, but no reduction may be permitted in the number of target units or land dedication required to qualify a residential project for a density bonus. Regardless of the number of target units or size of land dedication, no residential project may be entitled to a total density bonus of more than thirty-five percent. 
4.  Each residential project is entitled to only one density bonus, which may be selected by the applicant based on the percentage of either very low-income units, lower-income units, or moderate-income ownership units, or the project's status as a senior housing project. Density bonuses from more than one category may not be combined, except that bonuses for land dedication pursuant to Section 21.20.060 may be combined with bonuses granted pursuant to Section 21.20.040, up to a maximum of thirty-five percent, and an additional square footage bonus for childcare facilities may be granted as described in Section 21.20.070. 
5.  Land dedications that qualify a project for a density bonus do not fulfill the inclusionary housing requirements set forth in Chapter 21.24. 
6.  If an applicant desires affordable units to satisfy both the inclusionary requirements set forth in Chapter 21.24 and State density bonus requirements, the units must meet both the criteria of Chapter 21.24 and the State density bonus requirements as applied under this Chapter. 
Example: An applicant proposes to develop a one hundred-unit residential for-sale project and seeks a twenty percent density bonus by reserving five percent of the living units, or five living units, for very low-income households. 
The inclusionary requirements in Chapter 21.24 require that fifteen percent of the living units in a residential for-sale project shall be sold at affordable ownership cost to lower-income households and moderate-income households. Therefore an additional ten inclusionary units are needed to meet the fifteen percent inclusionary requirement. The income unit break down for this one hundred-unit project could be as follows: 
Example Inclusion-
ary Units Target Units DB Units Remaining Units Total Very low income: 5 5 Lower income: 2 2 Moderate income: 8 8 Market rate: 20 85 105 Total units: 120

The applicant shall provide a pro forma demonstrating to the city that the requested concession or incentive results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions to the project pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(l)(1). For purposes of this chapter, as defined in Government Code Section 65915(l), concessions and incentives means any of the following: 
a.  A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required that results in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. 
b.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the residential project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the residential project and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the residential project and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed residential project will be located. 
c.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city that result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. 
2.  Waiver or Modification. Applicants may also seek a waiver or modification of development standards that will have the effect of precluding the construction of a residential project meeting the criteria of Sections 21.20.030 and 21.20.040(1) or (2) at the densities or with the incentives or concessions permitted by this section. The applicant shall show: (1) that the development standards will preclude construction, and (2) the waiver or modification is necessary to make the residential project economically feasible based upon appropriate financial analysis and documentation as specified in Section 21.20.130. 
3.  Nothing in this section requires the city to provide direct financial incentives for the residential project, including, but not limited to, the provision of publicly owned land or waiver of fees or dedication requirements.

Target units shall have the same access to project amenities and recreational facilities as market rate units. 
3.  All building permits for target units qualifying a residential project for a density bonus shall be issued concurrently with, or prior to, issuance of building permits for the market rate units, and the target units shall be constructed concurrently with, or prior to, construction of the market rate units.

1.  An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or reduced parking standard pursuant to this chapter shall be reviewed as part of the first approval of the residential project by the approval body with authority to approve the residential project, unless additional review by the planning commission or City Council is required by Chapter 21.62. Any decision regarding a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or reduced standard may be appealed as part of an appeal of the residential project as provided in Chapter 21.62. In accordance with state law, neither the granting of a concession or incentive, nor the granting of a density bonus, shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval. 
2.  Before approving an application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or modification, the approval body shall make the following findings: 
a.  The residential project is eligible for a density bonus and any concessions, incentives, waivers, modifications, or reduced parking standards requested; conforms to all standards for affordability included in this chapter; and includes a financing mechanism for all implementation and monitoring costs; 
b.  Any requested incentive or concession will result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions based upon appropriate financial analysis and documentation if required by Section 21.20.110; 
c.  If the density bonus is based all or in part on dedication of land, the approval body has made the findings included in Government Code Section 65915(h); 
d.  If the density bonus, incentive, or concession is based all or in part on the inclusion of a childcare facility, the approval body has made the finding included in Government Code Section 65915(i); 
e.  If the incentive or concession includes mixed use buildings or developments, the approval body has made the finding included in Section 21.20.110(4)(g); 
f.  If a waiver or modification is requested, the applicant has shown that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible by providing appropriate financial analysis and documentation as described in Section 21.20.110(5), and that the development standards will have the effect of precluding the construction of the residential project at the densities or with the incentives or concessions permitted by this section. 
3.  The approval body may deny a request for an incentive or concession for which the findings set forth in Section 21.20.140(2) can be made only if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following: 
a.  The incentive or concession is not required to provide for affordable rents or affordable ownership costs; or 
b.  The incentive or concession would have a specific adverse impact upon public health or safety, or the physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to lower-, very low- and moderate-income households. For the purpose of this subsection, "specific adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions, as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete. 
4.  The approval body may deny a requested waiver or modification for which the findings set forth in Section 21.20.140(2) can be made only if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of either of the following: 
a.  The modification would have a specific adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to lower-, very low- and moderate-income households. For the purpose of this subsection, "specific adverse impact" means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified, written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date that the application was deemed complete; or 
b.  The modification would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historic Resources. 
5.  The approval body may deny a density bonus or concession that is based on the provision of childcare facilities and for which the findings set forth in Section 21.20.140(2) can be made only if it makes a written finding, based on substantial evidence, that the city already has adequate childcare facilities. 
6.  A request for a minor modification of an approved affordable housing plan may be granted the community development director or designee if the modification is substantially in compliance with the original affordable housing plan and conditions of approval. A minor modification is technical in nature, as opposed to substantive or material. Substantive or material changes to the affordable housing plan shall be processed in the same manner as the original plan.

The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Santa Clara County, California dated June 30, 1976, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), dated June 30, 1976, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this ordinance and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance and which are recommended to the City of Campbell by the Floodplain Administer. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at the Community Development Department located at 70 North First Street, Campbell California 95008. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violations of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Campbell from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation and greater restrictions. The regulations in this chapter are not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the regulations in this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent regulations shall prevail.

A zoning clearance, in compliance with Chapter 21.40, shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazards established in Subsection 21.22.030(B). Application for a zoning clearance shall be made on forms furnished by the community development department, and may include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; and existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
2.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be floodproofed; 
3.  All appropriate certifications listed in Subsection (C)(4), below; and 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
B.  Designation of the floodplain administrator. The community development director is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by allowing or denying development requests in compliance with its provisions. 
C.  Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  Permit review: 
a.  Review all development requests to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
b.  Determine that all other required State and federal permits have been obtained; 
c.  Determine that the site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
d.  Determine that the proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
2.  Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures: 
a.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
b.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
3.  Review, use and development of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with section 21.22.030, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State or other source, in order to administer Section 21.22.050 (Provisions for flood hazard reduction), below. Any information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. Note: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations," dated July 1995. 
4.  Notification of other Agencies. 
a.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
i.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration; 
ii.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency management Agency; and, 
iii.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
b.  Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
i.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administer shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
ii.  When a proposed flood control project will remove land from the SFHA and post-project development is proposed in those affected areas, building permits for said development shall not be issued until an approved LOMR for the flood control project has been received by the floodplain administrator. Building permits shall not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs) received as part of the entitlement process. An approved CLOMR allows submittal of construction plans for the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes to flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
c.  Changes corporate boundaries: 
i.  Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of the amp of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
5.  Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed: 
a.  The certification required in Subsection 21.22.050(A)(3)(a)(floor elevations); 
b.  The certification required in Subsection 21.22.050(A)(3)(b)(1) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures); 
c.  The certification required in subsection 21.22.050(A)(3)(c)(1) or 21.22.050(A)(3)(c)(2) (wet flood proofing standard); 
d.  The certified elevation required in Subsection 21.22.050(C)(2) (subdivision standards); 
e.  The certification required in Subsection 21.22.050(E) (Floodway Encroachments). 
6.  Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation, as provided in Section 21.22.060. 
7.  Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Subsection 21.22.030(C). 
(Ord. No. 2173, § 2(Exh. A), 1-21-2014) 
21.22.050 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  Standards of construction. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following standards are required: 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

d.  A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten pounds or no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls shall be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions: 
(1)  Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
(2)  The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood. 
3.  Elevation and flood proofing. 
a.  New construction and substantial improvement of any structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in Subsection (A)(3)(c), below. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the Building Inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated in conformance with Subsection (A)(3)(a), above, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
(1)  Be flood proofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; (2) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
(3)  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
c.  Require, for all new construction and substantial improvements, that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
(1)  Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided, the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or 
(2)  Be certified to comply with a local flood proofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration. 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Subsection (D). 
B.  Standards for utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from systems into floodwaters. 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Standards for subdivisions. 
1.  All preliminary subdivision proposals regardless of size shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
2.  All final subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structures and pads. If the site is filled above base flood, the final pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
4.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, (e.g., sewer, gas, electrical and water systems) located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
5.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Standards for manufactured homes. All new and replacement manufactured homes and additions to manufactured homes shall: 
1.  Be elevated so that the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation; and 
2.  Be securely anchored to a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. 
E.  Recreational Vehicles. All recreational vehicles placed on site within Zone A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or, 
3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 21.22.040 of this Chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" within subsection D above. 
F.  Floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Subsection 21.22.030(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Campbell. 
2.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Campbell shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
3.  If subsections 21.22.050(E)(1) and 21.22.050(E)(2) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 21.22.050. 
(Ord. No. 2173, § 2(Exh. A), 1-21-2014) 
21.22.060 - Variance procedure. 
A.  Appeal board. 
1.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for deviations from the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  The city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
3.  In passing upon applications, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter; and: 
a.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage, and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable. 
f.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  The relationship of the proposed use to the city's General Plan and floodplain management program for the subject area; 
i.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
k.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities, (e.g., sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.) 
4.  Generally, a deviation may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (A)(3)(d) through 21.22.060(A)(3)(k), above, have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification for issuing the variance increases. 
a.  Upon consideration of the factors in Subsection 21.22.060(A)(3), above, and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach conditions to the granting of a deviation as necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
b.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any deviation to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
B.  Conditions for deviations. 
1.  Deviations may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section. 
2.  Deviations shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
3.  Deviations shall only be issued upon a determination that the deviation is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
4.  Deviations shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the deviation would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a deviation will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
5.  Deviations may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that the provisions of subsections (B)(1) through (B)(4), above, are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
6.  Any applicant to whom a deviation is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and such construction below the based floor level increase risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administer in the Office of the Santa Clara County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

(Ord. No. 2216, § 6, 12-12-2016) 
Chapter 21.24 - INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE 

21.24.010 - Findings. 
    The City Council finds that: 
A.  Housing prices and rents in the city of Campbell have increased at a significantly higher rate than general wages. The lack of affordable housing in Campbell forces many residents to pay a very high percentage of their income for housing or to commute considerable distances, adding to air pollution and traffic congestion in Campbell and throughout Santa Clara County. The lack of affordable housing has made it more difficult to recruit workers from out of the area, in general, especially workers in lower-paying jobs, potentially affecting the economic vitality of the Campbell. New housing developments do not, to any appreciable extent, provide housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
B.  Continued new housing developments which do not include housing for low- and moderate-income households will serve to further aggravate the current shortage of affordable housing by reducing the small remaining supply of undeveloped land. 
C.  The City Council approved the City's housing element of the general plan which includes a goal to encourage the provision of housing affordable to a variety of household income levels (Goal H-3.1 Housing Development; Policy H-3.2a Citywide Inclusionary Housing Ordinance). 
D.  Implementation of the inclusionary ordinance is a necessary part of the City's efforts to meet its general plan housing element goals and objectives and its region wide affordable housing obligations. Through the inclusionary ordinance, at least fifteen percent of the units in a new housing development of ten or more units will be price or rent restricted as units for low- and moderate-income households. In some circumstances, developers will be offered an option of providing affordable units off-site or payment of an in-lieu housing fee. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.020 - Purpose of chapter. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to further the City's efforts to require housing available to very low-income, low-income and moderate-income households. The city's general plan implements the established policy of the State of California that each community should foster an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels. 
    Providing the affordable units required by this chapter will help to ensure that part of Campbell's remaining developable land is used to provide affordable housing. An economically balanced community is only possible if part of the new housing built in the City is affordable to households with limited incomes. Requiring builders of new housing to include some housing affordable to households at a range of incomes is fair, not only because new development without affordable units contributes to the shortage of affordable housing, but also because zoning and other ordinances concerning new housing should be consistent with the community's goal to foster an adequate supply of housing for persons at all economic levels. In general, affordable units within each housing development will serve the goal of maintaining an economically balanced community. 
    The inclusionary housing ordinance is required by the council to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare while preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality of the City. (Ordinance 2060, December 2005 Code Update, Title 21 Zoning, 21.01.030 Purpose). 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006).

(Ord. No. 2206, § 14, 8-2-2016) 
21.24.050 - Time performance. 
A.  An application for first approval of a residential project will not be deemed complete until the applicant has submitted plans and proposals which demonstrate the manner in which the applicant proposes to meet the requirements of this chapter, including any plans for the construction of on-site units pursuant to Section 21.24.040 of this chapter or the applicant's selection of an alternative means of compliance pursuant to Section 21.24.070 of this chapter. 
B.  Conditions to carry out the purposes of this chapter shall be imposed on the first approval for a residential project. Additional conditions may be imposed on later city approvals or actions, including without limitation planned development permits, tentative parcel maps, tentative subdivision maps, conditional use permits, site and architectural review permits, or building permits. The conditions of approval included with the first approval of the residential project shall further provide that prior to the recordation of the parcel map or final map in the case of subdivisions and or prior to the issuance of building permits in the case of all other land use permits to which this chapter applies, the applicant shall enter into an inclusionary housing agreement acceptable to the community development director that contains specific requirements implementing the condition of approval including, but not limited to, as applicable, the number of affordable units, the level(s) of affordability, location and type of affordable units, timing of construction of affordable units in relation to the construction of the market rate units contained in the development, preferences given in selecting occupants, and amount of the in-lieu fee, if any. The inclusionary housing agreement may be amended by the parties, provided the amendment is consistent with the condition of approval imposed as part of the first approval and the then-existing city approvals. If such proposed amendment is minor or technical in nature, the community development director shall have authority to approve or disapprove the amendment on behalf of the city. If such proposed amendment makes a substantive or material change to the inclusionary housing agreement, such amendment shall be effective only if, following notice and hearing and such other procedures as may be required by law, approved by the city agency that gave the first approval on the project. 
C.  No building permit shall be issued for any market rate unit until the applicant has obtained permits for affordable units sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 21.24.040 of this chapter, or received approval of an alternative requirement of Section 21.24.070 of this chapter. No final inspection for occupancy for any market rate unit shall be completed until the applicant has constructed the affordable units required by Section 21.24.040 of this chapter, or completed corresponding alternative performance under Section 21.24.070 of this chapter. The time requirements set forth in this subsection for issuance of building permits for market rate units and for final inspections for occupancy for market rate units may be modified to accommodate phasing schedules, model variations, or other factors in a residential project, if the city determines this will provide greater public benefit and an inclusionary housing agreement acceptable to the community development director or the Community Development Director's designee pursuant to subsection B of this section so provides. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.060 - Continued affordability and city review of occupancy. 
A.  Term of affordability-For-sale projects. A resale restriction, covenant, deed of trust and/or other documents acceptable to the community development director or the director's designee, shall be recorded against each affordable owner-occupied unit. These documents shall, in the case of affordable units which are initially sold, be for a term of forty-five years and shall be renewed at the change of each title for a period of forty-five years. The resale restriction, or other documents authorized by this subsection, and any change in the form of any such documents which materially alters any policy in the documents, shall be approved by the community development director or his or her designee prior to being executed with respect to any residential project. 
B.  Term of affordability-Rental projects. A regulatory agreement, covenant, deed of trust, and/or other documents acceptable to the Community Development Director or the Director's designee, shall be recorded against each unit/complex for residential projects containing affordable rental units. These documents shall, in the case of affordable units which are rented, be for a term of fifty-five years and shall be renewed at the change of each title for a period of fifty-five years. The regulatory agreement and other documents authorized by this subsection, shall run with the property and not be affected by the sale of the property or units in the project. The regulatory agreement and other documents authorized by this subsection, and any change in the form of any such document which materially alters any policy in the document, shall be approved by the Community Development Director or his or her designee prior to being executed with respect to any residential project. 
C.  Eligibility requirements. No household shall be permitted to begin occupancy of an affordable unit unless the city or its designee has approved the household's eligibility. If the city or its designee maintains a list of, or otherwise identifies, eligible households, initial and subsequent occupants of affordable units shall be selected first from the list of identified households, to the maximum extent possible, in accordance with rules approved by the community development director or his or her designee. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.070 - Alternatives. 
    An applicant may elect, in lieu of building affordable units within a residential project, to satisfy the requirements of this chapter by one of the following alternative modes of compliance, provided that the applicant includes such election in its application for the first approval of the residential project and that the criteria stated in the relevant subsection below are satisfied. 
A.  Rental units in for-sale projects. Where owner-occupied affordable units are required by Section 21.24.040 of this chapter, instead construct as part of the residential project the same or a greater number of rental units, affordable to lower-income households and very low-income households in the proportions and at the rents as prescribed in Section 21.24.040(E) of this chapter. Substitution of rental units shall be allowed under this subsection only if either: (1) the rental units are at least equal in number of bedrooms to the owner-occupancy units which would have been allowed, or (2) any comparative deficiency in bedrooms is compensated for by additional units and/or affordability to households with lower incomes. 
B.  Off-site construction. Construct, or make possible construction by another developer of, units not physically contiguous to the market-rate units (or units that are physically contiguous to the market-rate units if the City determines this will provide greater public benefit and if an inclusionary housing agreement acceptable to the Community Development Director or his or her designee pursuant to Section 21.24.050(B) of this chapter so provides) and equal or greater in number to the number of affordable units required under Section 21.24.040 of this chapter. Off-site construction pursuant to this subsection shall be approved only if: 
1.  Approval has been secured for the off-site units not later than the time the residential project is approved and completion of the off-site units is secured by a requirement that final inspections for occupancy for the related market-rate units be completed after those for the affordable units, provided that the time requirements set forth in this subsection for final inspections for occupancy for market-rate units may be modified to accommodate phasing schedules, model variations, financing requirements, or other factors in a residential project for the off-site units, if the City determines this will provide greater public benefit, and if an inclusionary housing agreement acceptable to the Community Development Director or his or her designee pursuant to Section 21.24.050(B) of this chapter so provides; 
2.  The off-site units will be greater in number, larger or affordable to households with lower incomes than would otherwise be required in Section 21.24.040 of this chapter; 
3.  Financing or a viable financing plan is in place for the off-site units; 
4.  In the event the off-site units receive any public assistance, the developer of the residential project will contribute to the off-site units economic value equivalent to the value of making on-site units in the developer's residential project affordable; and 
5.  The City may require that completion of off-site units shall be further secured by the developer's agreement to pay an in-lieu fee in the amount due under subsection D of this section in the event the off-site units are not timely completed. 
C.  Land dedication. Dedicate without cost to the city, a lot or lots within or contiguous to the residential project, sufficient to accommodate at least the required affordable units for the residential project. An election to dedicate land in lieu of compliance with other provisions of this chapter shall be allowed only if: 
1.  The value of the lot or lots to be dedicated is sufficient to make development of the otherwise required affordable units economically feasible, and financing or a viable financing plan is in place for at least the required number of affordable units; and 
2.  The lot or lots are suitable for construction of affordable housing at a feasible cost, served by utilities, streets and other infrastructure, there are no hazardous material or other material constraints on development of affordable housing on the lot or lots, and land use approvals have been obtained as necessary for the development of the affordable units on the lot or lots. 
D.  In-lieu housing fee. Where a residential project has an approved density of six or fewer units per acre, the applicant may elect to pay an in-lieu housing fee, instead of developing the affordable units required in Section 21.24.040 of this chapter, pursuant to the requirements set forth below in this subsection. 
1.  The initial in-lieu fee schedule shall be set by City Council fee resolution or other action of the City Council so that the fee amounts are not greater than the difference between: (a) the amount of a conventional permanent loan that an inclusionary unit would support based on the affordable rent or sales price for the required inclusionary unit; and (b) the estimated total development cost of prototypical inclusionary units. 
2.  The City Council may annually review the fees authorized by this subsection D of this section by resolution, and may, based on that review, adjust the fee amount. For any annual period during which the City Council does not review the fee authorized by this subsection, fee amounts shall be adjusted once by the community development director or his or her designee based on the construction cost index. 
3.  In-lieu fees shall be calculated based on the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. In-lieu fees shall be paid prior to issuance of building permits for market-rate units in a residential project. If building permits are issued for only part of a residential project, the fee amount shall be based only on the number of units then permitted. Where payment is delayed, in the event of default or for any other reason, the amount of the in-lieu fee payable under this subsection D of this section shall be based upon the fee schedule in effect at the time the fee is paid. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.080 - Use of in-lieu housing fees. 
A.  All in-lieu fees collected under this chapter shall be deposited into a separate account to be designated the City of Campbell housing trust fund. 
B.  The in-lieu fees collected under this chapter and all earnings from investment of the fees shall be expended exclusively to provide or assure continued provision of affordable housing in the city through acquisition, construction, development assistance, rehabilitation, financing, rent subsidies or other methods, and for costs of administering programs which serve those ends. The housing shall be of a type, or made affordable at a cost or rent, for which there is a need in the City and which is not adequately supplied in the City by private housing development in the absence of public assistance. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.090 - Waiver of requirements. 
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall be waived, adjusted or reduced if the applicant shows that there is no reasonable relationship between the impact of a proposed residential project and the requirements of this chapter, or that applying the requirements of this chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California Constitution or otherwise result in an unconstitutional application of this chapter. To receive a waiver, adjustment or reduction under this section, the applicant must file a written request together with the development application(s) when applying for a first approval for the residential project, and/or as part of any appeal which the City provides as part of the process for the first approval. The written request shall provide substantial evidence showing that there is no reasonable relationship between the impact of a proposed residential project and the requirements of this chapter, or that applying the requirements of this chapter would take property in violation of the United States or California Constitution or otherwise result in an unconstitutional application of this chapter. The City may assume that: (a) the applicant will provide the most economical inclusionary units feasible meeting the requirements of this chapter; and (b) the applicant is likely to obtain housing subsidies when such funds are reasonably available. The waiver, adjustment, or reduction may be approved only to the extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional result, after adoption of written findings, based on substantial evidence, supporting the determinations required by this section. 
(Ord. 2074 Att. 3 (part), 2006). 
21.24.100 - Enforcement. 
A.  The City Council may adopt guidelines, by resolution, to assist in the implementation of all aspects of this chapter. 
B.  No permit, license, subdivision approval or map, or other approval or entitlement for a residential project shall be issued, including without limitation a final inspection for occupancy or certificate of occupancy, until all requirements applicable to the residential project at such time pursuant to this chapter have been satisfied. 
C.  The City Attorney shall be authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter and all inclusionary housing agreements, regulatory agreements, resale controls, deeds of trust, or similar documents placed on affordable units, by civil action and any other proceeding or method permitted by law. 
D.  Failure of any official or agency to fulfill the requirements of this chapter shall not excuse any applicant or owner from the requirements of this chapter. 
E.  The remedies provided for in this chapter shall be cumulative and not exclusive and shall not preclude the city from any other remedy or relief to which it otherwise would be entitled under law or equity.

This chapter is intended to allow a reasonable amount of signing for business, product, building identification, and noncommercial messages so as to provide adequate information to the public without creating a cluttered visual environment. These regulations shall apply to all zoning districts in addition to any specific provisions in the applicable zoning district regulations. The City Council finds that any and all violations of this chapter unnecessarily detract from the public health, safety, and welfare and are indecent and offensive to the senses in that they unnecessarily clutter the environment and therefore constitute a public nuisance.

1.  Diseased or danger of falling. The tree or trees are diseased or presents a danger of falling that cannot be controlled or remedied through reasonable preservation and/or preventative procedures and practices such that the public health or safety requires its removal. 
2.  Structure Damage. The tree or trees have caused or may imminently cause significant damage to the existing main structure(s) that cannot be controlled or remedied through reasonable modification of the tree's root or branch structure. 
3.  Utility Interference. The tree or trees have interfered with utility services where such interference cannot be controlled or remedied through reasonable modification/relocation of the utility services and/or reasonable modification of the tree's root or branch structure. 
4.  Overplanting. The tree(s) is crowding other protected tree(s) to the extent that removal is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of adjacent tree(s). 
5.  Economic enjoyment and hardship. The retention of the tree(s) restricts the economic enjoyment of the property or creates an unusual hardship for the property owner by severely limiting the use of the property in a manner not typically experienced by owners of similarly zoned and situated properties, and the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the approval authority that there are no reasonable alternatives to preserve the tree(s). A minor reduction of the potential number of residential units or building size due to the tree location does not represent a severe limit of the economic enjoyment of the property. 
B.  Additional recommendations. The community development director may refer the application to another department or commission for a report and recommendation. 
C.  Inspections and permit availability. City staff shall have the authority to conduct on-site inspections of all trees proposed for removal. If a tree removal permit is approved, the permit shall be on-site at all times prior to and during the removal of a tree and/or shall be made available to any city official at the site, upon request. 
D.  Action. Based on the criteria outlined in this section, the approval authority shall either; approve, conditionally approve or deny the application. Conditions of approval may include any of the following:

B.  Payment for value of unlawfully removed tree(s). Where replacement trees will not provide equivalent aesthetic quality because of the size, age, or other characteristics of the unlawfully removed tree, the community development director shall estimate the value of the removed tree using the latest edition of The Guide for Establishing Values of Trees and Other Plants, prepared by the council of tree and landscape appraisers, as a resource. Upon the determination of the value, the community development director, may require a cash payment to the city to be added to a street tree fund for the cost of purchasing trees for installation within the public right-of-way or on other public property as directed by the public works department. 
C.  Combination of cash payment and tree replacement. If the site layout cannot reasonably accommodate the required number of trees in compliance with the tree replacement penalty ratios and/or tree spacing consistent with standard forestry practices, the community development director may approve a combination of a cash payment either in whole or in part and a portion of the replacement trees in compliance with this section. The cumulative value of the cash payment and the replacement trees shall be equivalent to the monetary, aesthetic, and environmental value of the unlawfully removed tree.

    In order to carry out more effectively and equitably the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may, by resolution, approve one of the following incentives to support the preservation, maintenance and appropriate rehabilitation of a historic resource. The decision of whether or not to offer or grant any incentive shall rest in the sole and unfettered discretion of the City Council; and nothing contained in this section shall obligate the Council to offer or grant any incentive. 
A.  Economic Incentives. 
1.  Mills Act. To qualify for the Mills Act program, a structure must be designated as a historic resource on the city's historic resource inventory. Priority will be given to applications that substantially reduce the threat to the historic resource of demolition, deterioration, abandonment, and/or general neglect and that result in the greatest value of improvements to the historic resource thereby resulting in the greatest benefit to the public. One hundred percent of the estimated tax savings shall be used to finance the improvements and property maintenance of the historic resource. 
2.  Permit Fee Waivers. An individual may file a request for City Council consideration to grant a full or partial waiver of application processing fee(s) required under this chapter whenever the City Council finds that such waiver would advance the purposes of the Historic Preservation Ordinance and the General Plan.

2.  Zoning Exception. The purpose of a zoning exception is intended to provide a degree of flexibility from the Zoning Ordinance as necessary to minimize impact to the historic character of a historic resource. The types of zoning exceptions that may be considered include relief from the required setbacks, residential parking, sign area, allowed uses, or permit requirements. The decision making body shall approve the zoning exception if the following findings have been made: 
a.  The zoning exception will facilitate development and use of a historic resource in a manner that is more consistent with its historic character than would be possible under strict compliance with the Zoning Ordinance; 
b.  The zoning exception will not adversely impact property or public rights-of-way in the surrounding neighborhood or within a historic district; 
c.  The zoning exception will not negatively impact the integrity or historic characteristics of the historic resource; 
d.  The zoning exception is the minimum departure from the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance; and 
e.  The zoning exception is in conformance with the General Plan, adopted area plan, and applicable design guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 2230, § 3(Exh. A), 2-20-2018)

    Issuance of a permit in conformance with this chapter does not relieve anyone from compliance with the requirements of other standards and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance or those of the building and fire codes. 
(Ord. No. 2230, § 3(Exh. A), 2-20-2018) 
21.33.170 - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause, phrase or part of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the final decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter or any part thereof.

21.34.070 - General requirements; standard conditions of approval. 
    In addition to any other conditions of approval permitted under federal and state law and that the decision-making body deems appropriate, all wireless communications facilities whether approved through a conditional use permit, an administrative site and architectural review permit, zoning clearance, or deemed granted by the operation of law, shall include and abide by the following conditions of approval: 
A.  All Facilities. The following standard conditions of approval apply to all facilities and shall be included in all conditional use permits and administrative site and architectural review permits approved under this Chapter: 
1.  Cessation of operations. The service provider shall provide written notification to the community development director upon cessation of operations on the site exceeding a ninety calendar day period. The service provider, permittee and/or property owner shall remove all obsolete or unused facilities from the site within one hundred eighty calendar days of termination of the lease with the property owner or cessation of operations, whichever comes earlier. 
a.  New permit required. If a consecutive period of one hundred eighty calendar days has lapsed since cessation of operations, a new permit shall be required prior to use or reuse of the site. 
2.  Length of approval. A validly issued conditional use permit, or administrative site and architectural review permit shall be valid for a period of ten years from the effective date of the approval (or date the facility gains a "deemed granted" status) but may be reduced for public safety reasons or substantial land use reasons pursuant to Government Code Section 65964(b). Use permits and site and architectural review permits approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall expire pursuant to the previously approved permit term. If a request for a renewal of the required permits(s) is received before the permit expiration, the permit shall remain in effect until a decision on the renewal is made or the application is withdrawn. Communication facilities that exist on the effective date of this chapter without a specified expiration date (e.g. because the governing permit(s) contained no expiration date or due to non-conforming status), and which had not otherwise already expired (e.g. due to the previously established amortization period(s) contained in City Council Ordinance 2070, CMC Section 21.34.060(E), and/or CMC Section 21.58.040(F), as they existed prior to the effective date of this Chapter), shall expire five years from the effective date of this chapter or ten years from the date of their establishment, whichever is greater. Nothing contained in this Chapter is intended to revive or extend any permit or use that expired on or prior to the effective date of this Chapter. 
a.  The permit may be renewed for subsequent time periods, subject to the following: 
i.  The renewal application is filed with the community development department prior to expiration, but no earlier than twenty-four months prior to expiration. 
ii.  The permit approval may be administratively extended by the community development director from the initial approval date for a subsequent ten years and may be extended by the community development director every ten years thereafter upon verification that the facility continues to comply with this chapter (as may be amended from time to time) and all conditions of approval under which the facility was approved. All costs associated with the review process shall be borne by the service provider, permittee and/or property owner. 
iii.  This provision shall not apply to conditional use permits or administrative site and architectural review permits granted prior to the effective date of this chapter. However, applications for use permits or site and architectural review permits to modify existing wireless communications facilities that are granted on or after the effective date of this chapter are subject to this subsection 21.34.070(A)(2)(a). 
b.  If a request for renewal of the required permit(s) is not timely received and the permit expires, the City may declare the facility(ies) abandoned or discontinued in accordance with Section 21.34.070(A)(16) (Abandonment). 
3.  Business license required. Each service provider with a wireless communications facility in the City shall obtain and maintain a City business license. 
4.  Impact on parking. The installation of wireless communication facilities shall not reduce required parking on the site. For the purposes of this requirement, routine maintenance activities shall not be considered to result in a measurable impact on parking. Applications for eligible facilities requests shall be exempt from this condition provided that any reduction in onsite parking spaces does not violate a prior condition of approval or applicable building or safety code. 
5.  Implementation and monitoring costs. The wireless communications permittee, service provider or its/their successor shall be responsible for the payment of all reasonable costs associated with the monitoring of the conditions of approval, including, but not limited to, costs incurred by the community development department, the office of the city attorney or any other appropriate City department or agency, to the full extent such costs are recoverable or collectible under applicable state and/or federal law. The community development department shall collect costs on behalf of the City. 
6.  Development and operational standards. All facilities shall satisfy the development standards of the district in which they are proposed, as well as the Development and Operational Standards outlined in CMC 21.16 (e.g. Electrical Interference, Light and Glare, Noise, Odor, Vibration, Maintenance) and the Site Development Standards (e.g. as specified in CMC 21.18). Exceptions to development and operational standards shall only be permitted for (A) an eligible facility request to the extent required by law, (B) a subsequent collocation facility to the extent required by California Government Code section 65850.6(a), or (C) for a stealth facility when such exception is limited to maximum allowable heights, or minimum setbacks, and when such exception would not result in a perceivable visual impact. 
7.  Permits. All permits required for the installation of the facility and associated improvements, shall be completed prior to operation of the facility (or component of that facility). 
8.  Concealment. Every aspect of a stealth and/or concealed facility is considered an element of concealment including, but not limited to, the dimensions, bulk and scale, color, materials and texture. For all other facilities, elements such as dimension, scale, color, materials, and textures may be considered stealth and/or concealment elements of the facility. Any future modifications to the facility must not defeat concealment 
9.  Compliance with Applicable Laws. The permittee and service provider shall at all times comply with all applicable provisions of the CMC including, but not limited to, Title 21 (Zoning), any permit or approval issued under the CMC including, but not limited to, Title 21 (Zoning), and all other applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Failure by the City to enforce compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations shall not relieve any permittee of its obligations under the CMC including, but not limited to, Title 21 (Zoning), any permit or approval issued under the CMC, or any other applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
10.  Compliance with Approved Plans. The facility shall be built in compliance with the approved plans on file with the community development department. 
11.  Inspections; Emergencies. The City or its designee may enter onto the facility area to inspect the facility upon reasonable notice to the permittee in times of emergency. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections. The City reserves the right to enter (or direct its designee to enter) the facility and support, repair, disable or remove any elements of the facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons or property. 
12.  Contact Information for Responsible Parties. The permittee shall at all times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address and email address for at least one natural person. All such contact information for responsible parties shall be provided to the community development director upon request. 
13.  General Maintenance. The site and the facility, including but not limited to all landscaping, fencing, concealment features, and related transmission equipment, must be maintained in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all approved plans and conditions of approval. 
14.  Graffiti Removal. All graffiti on facilities must be removed at the sole expense of the permittee within forty-eight hours after notification from the City. 
15.  FCC (including, but not limited to, RF Exposure) Compliance. All facilities must comply with all standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal government agency with the authority to regulate such facilities. 
16.  Abandonment. 
a.  To promote the public health, safety and welfare, the community development director may declare a facility (or component of a facility) abandoned or discontinued when: (a) The permittee or service provider abandoned or discontinued the use of a facility (or component of a facility) for a continuous period of ninety calendar days; or (b) The permittee or service provider fails to respond within thirty calendar days to a written notice from the community development director that states the basis for the community development director's belief that the facility (or component of the facility) has been abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of ninety calendar days; or (c) The permit expires and the permittee has failed to file a timely application for renewal. 
b.  After the community development director declares a facility (or component of a facility) abandoned or discontinued, the permittee shall have sixty calendar days from the date of the declaration (or longer time as the community development director may approve in writing as reasonably necessary) to: (a) reactivate the use of the abandoned or discontinued facility (or component thereof) subject to the provisions of this chapter and all conditions of approval; or (b) remove the facility (or component of that facility) and all improvements installed in connection with the facility (or component of that facility), unless directed otherwise by the community development director, and restore the site to a condition in compliance with all applicable codes and consistent with the then-existing surrounding area. 
c.  If the permittee fails to act as required in Section 21.34.070(A)(16)(b) within the prescribed time period, the City may (but shall not be obligated to) remove the abandoned facility (or abandoned component of the facility), restore the site to a condition in compliance with all applicable codes and consistent with the then-existing surrounding area, and repair any and all damages that occurred in connection with such removal and restoration work. The City may, but shall not be obligated to, store the removed facility (or component of the facility) or any part thereof, and may use, sell or otherwise dispose of it in any manner the City deems appropriate. The last-known permittee or its successor-in-interest and, if on private property, the real property owner shall be jointly liable for all costs and expenses incurred by the City in connection with such removal, restoration, repair and storage, and shall promptly reimburse the City upon receipt of a written demand, including, without limitation, any interest on the balance owing at the maximum lawful rate. The City may, but shall not be obligated to, use any financial security required in connection with the granting of the facility permit to recover its costs and interest. Until the costs are paid in full, a lien shall be placed on the facility, all related personal property in connection with the facility and, if applicable, the real private property on which the facility was located for the full amount of all costs for removal, restoration, repair and storage (plus applicable interest). The City Clerk shall cause the lien to be recorded with the County of Santa Clara Recorder's Office. Within sixty calendar days after the lien amount is fully satisfied including costs and interest, the City Clerk shall cause the lien to be released with the County of Santa Clara Recorder's Office. 
d.  After a permittee fails to comply with any provisions of this Section 21.34.070(A)(16) (Abandonment), the City may elect to treat the facility as a nuisance to be abated as provided in the CMC (including, but not limited to, Chapter 6.10). 
17.  Indemnities. The permittee, service provider, and, if applicable, the non-government owner of the private property upon which the tower and/or base station is installed (or is to be installed) shall defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the City), indemnify and hold harmless the City of Campbell its officers, officials, directors, agents, representatives, and employees (i) from and against any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and from and against any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, judgments, writs of mandamus and other actions or proceedings brought against the City or its officers, officials, directors, agents, representatives, or employees to challenge, attack, seek to modify, set aside, void or annul the City's approval of the permit, and (ii) from and against any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs and expenses and any and all claims, demands, lawsuits, judgments, or causes of action and other actions or proceedings of any kind or form, whether for personal injury, death or property damage, arising out of, in connection with or relating to the acts, omissions, negligence, or performance of the permittee, the service provider, and/or, if applicable, the private property owner, or any of each one's agents, representatives, employees, officers, directors, licensees, contractors, subcontractors or independent contractors. It is expressly agreed that the City shall have the right to approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) the legal counsel providing the City's defense, and the property owner, service provider, and/or permittee (as applicable) shall reimburse City for any and all costs and expenses incurred by the City in the course of the defense. 
B.  Eligible Facilities Requests/Zoning Clearances. In addition to the conditions in subsection (A) above, all eligible facilities requests shall comply with and all associated zoning clearances shall include the following standard conditions of approval: 
1.  No Permit Term Extension. The City's grant or grant by operation of law of a zoning clearance for an eligible facilities request constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the subject tower or base station. The City's grant or grant by operation of law of a zoning clearance for an eligible facilities request will not extend the permit term for any use permit, administrative site and architectural review permit or other underlying regulatory permit or approval and its term shall be coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the subject tower or base station. If requested in writing by the applicant at the time of application submittal, the permit term for the underlying conditional use permit or administrative site and architectural review permit may be administratively extended by the community development director (at his/her discretion) from the initial approval date upon verification that the facility continues to comply with this chapter (as may be amended from time to time) and all conditions of approval under which the facility was approved. All costs associated with the review process shall be borne by the service provider, permittee and/or property owner. 
2.  No Waiver of Standing. The approval of a zoning clearance for an eligible facilities request (either by express approval or grant by operation of law) does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the City to challenge Section 6409(a), any FCC rules that interpret Section 6409(a) or any eligible facilities request. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.080 - Regulations for facilities subject to a zoning clearance. 
    This subsection shall be interpreted and applied so as to be consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Section 6409(a), and the applicable FCC decisions and FCC rules and regulations, and court decisions and determinations relating to the same, including, without limitation, 80 FR 1238 (January 8, 2015), 47 C.F.R. §§1.1306(c), 1.1307(a)(4)(ii), 1.40001 et seq., In the Matter of Acceleration of Broadband Deployment by Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd. 12865 (2014), and In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994 (2009). In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction invalidates all or any portion of Section 6409(a) or any FCC rule that interprets Section 6409(a) such that federal law would not mandate approval for an eligible facilities request, then all modifications to existing facilities subject to this section that are proposed after such invalidation must be approved by a conditional use permit or administrative site and architectural review permit, as applicable, subject to the discretion of the community development director. 
A.  Findings. The community development director must approve a zoning clearance for an eligible facilities request when the director finds all of the following: 
1.  The proposed modification qualifies as an eligible facilities request and does not constitute a "substantial change" as defined in Section 21.34.200. 
2.  The applicant has provided all required submittal materials for the proposed modification. 
B.  Denial. In addition to any other alternative recourse permitted under federal law, the community development director may deny a zoning clearance upon finding that the proposed facility: 
1.  Defeats the effect of existing concealment elements of the support structure; 
2.  Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition related to compliance with generally applicable building, structural, electrical and/or safety codes; 
3.  Violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition reasonably related to public health and/or safety; or 
4.  Does not qualify for mandatory approval under Section 6409(a) for any lawful reason. 
C.  Denial Without Prejudice. Any denial of an application for an eligible facilities request shall be without prejudice to the applicant, the real property owner or the project. Subject to the application and submittal requirements in this chapter, the applicant may submit a permit application (together with all required fees, costs and deposits) for a use permit, administrative site and architectural review permit, or zoning clearance, as appropriate. 
D.  Extensions. The approval of a zoning clearance for an eligible facilities request shall not automatically extend or renew the length or term of the underlying permit term or facility build out. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.090 - Location of wireless communications facilities. 
A.  To the extent feasible and when doing so would not conflict with applicable federal or state law, wireless communications facilities subject to the review and approval of a conditional use permit or an administrative site and architectural review permit shall be located in the most preferred location as described in this section and the General Plan, according to the following order of priority (ordered from the most preferred to the least preferred): 
    More preferred areas: 
1.  City owned or controlled parcels; then 
2.  Industrial, research and development & institutional designated parcels; then 
3.  General commercial, central commercial, professional office, and mixed-use designated parcels; then 
4.  Neighborhood commercial and open space designated parcels; then 
    Less preferred areas: 
5.  Residential, historical, and other designated areas, districts and/or parcels; then 
6.  All other areas. 
B.  If an applicant proposes to locate a new facility or substantial change to an existing facility in a less preferred area, the applicant shall provide an additional alternative site analysis that, at a minimum, includes a meaningful comparative analysis of all the alternative sites in the more preferred locations that the applicant considered and states the underlying factual basis for concluding, and demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the decision-making body, why each alternative in a more preferred location(s) is/are (i) not technically feasible, (ii) not potentially available, and/or (iii) more intrusive. The decision-making body may authorize a facility to be established in a less preferred location if doing so is necessary to prevent substantial aesthetic impacts. 
C.  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 21.34.090 (Location of wireless communications facilities) to the contrary, facilities in the public-right-of way may be found preferable to a location on private property, to the extent feasible and provided that the same order of priority, in consideration of the abutting land use(s), is maintained. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.100 - Design requirements. 
    All wireless communications facilities subject to a conditional use permit or an administrative site and architectural review permit shall be designed as a stealth facility, or as a concealed facility, as defined in Section 21.34.200, and incorporate concealment measures and/or techniques appropriate for the proposed location and design. All facilities and modifications thereto (except those facilities which qualify as an eligible facilities request pursuant to Section 6409(a) or as a subsequent collocation facility that is a permitted use not subject to a city discretionary permit pursuant to California Government Code section 65850.6(a), for which these provisions shall serve only as guidelines) shall also comply with the Wireless Facility Design Requirements that have been adopted by the City. The cost or inconvenience to comply shall not provide justification to deviate from City design requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.110 - Special findings for wireless communications facilities.

(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.120 - Failure to act and remedies. 
    Under federal and/or state law, the City's failure to act on a wireless communications facility permit application within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions, accounting for tolling periods, may result in the permit being deemed granted by operation of law. To the extent federal or state law provides a "deemed grant" remedy for wireless communications facility applications not timely acted upon by the City, no such application shall be deemed granted unless and until the applicant satisfies the following requirements: 
A.  For all facility applications: 
1.  Submits a complete application package, pursuant to the application procedures as specified in this chapter and applicable federal and state law and regulations. 
2.  Following the date by which the City must take final action on the application (as determined in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions and accounting for tolling), the applicant must provide notice to the City that the application is deemed granted by operation of law. 
B.  For conditional use permits and administrative site and architectural review permit applications: 
1.  Completes all public noticing required pursuant to CMC Section 21.64.020 (Notice of hearing). 
2.  No more than thirty calendar days before the date by which the City must take final action on the application (as determined in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions and accounting for tolling), the applicant must provide the following written notice to all recipients identified in CMC Section 21.64.020(B)(2) (Mailing) and to the City. 
a.  The notice shall be delivered to the City in person or by certified United States mail. 
b.  The notice must state that the applicant has submitted an application to the City, describe the location and general characteristics of the proposed facility, and include the following statement: "Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65964.1, state law may deem the application approved in thirty calendar days unless the City approves or denies the application, or the City and applicant reach a mutual tolling agreement." 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.130 - Prohibited grounds for denial. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the denial of a conditional use permit, administrative site and architectural review permit, or zoning clearance may not be based on the environmental effects of RF emissions for wireless communications facilities that comply with FCC regulations, standards and guidelines concerning such RF emissions. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.140 - Revocation of permit. 
    The City may revoke a permit for a wireless communications facility for noncompliance with any enforceable permit, permit condition, or law applicable to the facility. When the community development director finds reason to believe that grounds for permit revocation exist, the director shall notify the permittee that a violation exists and request compliance within a reasonable amount of time. Upon failure to comply, the community development director may schedule a public hearing before the planning commission at which the commission may modify or revoke the permit. A revocation by the planning commission may be appealed to the City Council. All hearings shall be noticed and conducted in compliance with the proceedings set forth in CMC Chapter 21.68 (Revocations and modifications). 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.150 - Temporary wireless communications facilities. 
    A temporary wireless communications facility, such as a "cell-on-wheels" (COW) may be used during public emergencies, including when a local emergency is declared by the City Manager. A COW or similar temporary wireless communications facility or equipment shall not be permitted for maintenance activities or while awaiting an expected entitlement or pending plan review, and the temporary allowance of such equipment or facility during an emergency shall not be considered to establish a permanent use of such a facility or structure after the emergency has ended, as declared by the City Manager. Once the emergency has ended, the temporary wireless communications facility shall be removed. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.160 - Limited exemption from standards. 
    The applicant always bears the burden to demonstrate why an exemption should be granted. An applicant may request an exemption from one or more requirements of this chapter on the basis that a permit denial would effectively prohibit personal wireless services in the City. For the City to approve such an exemption, the applicant must demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence all of the following: 
A.  A significant gap in the applicant's service coverage exists; and 
B.  All alternative sites identified in the application review process are either technically infeasible or not potentially available. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.170 - Independent consultant review. 
A.  Authorization. The City Council authorizes the community development director to, in his or her discretion, select and retain an independent consultant with expertise in telecommunications satisfactory to the community development director in connection with any permit application. 
B.  Scope. The community development director may request independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert knowledge in connection with the permit application. Such issues may include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Permit application completeness or accuracy; 
2.  Whether and where a significant gap exists or may exist, and whether such a gap relates to service coverage or service capacity; 
3.  Whether technically feasible and potentially available alternative locations and designs exist; 
4.  The applicability, reliability and/or sufficiency of analyses or methodologies used by the applicant to reach conclusions about any issue within the scope of this Chapter; and 
5.  Any other issue that requires expert or specialized knowledge identified by the community development director. 
C.  Deposit. To the full extent such costs are recoverable or collectible under applicable state and/or federal law, the applicant must pay for the reasonable cost of such review and for the technical consultant's testimony in any hearing as requested by the community development director and must provide a reasonable advance deposit of the estimated cost of such review with the City prior to the commencement of any work by the technical consultant. Where the advance deposit(s) are insufficient to pay for the reasonable cost of such review and/or testimony, the community development director shall invoice the applicant who shall pay the invoice in full within ten calendar days after receipt of the invoice. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.180 - Changes in law. 
    All facilities shall meet the current standards and regulations of the FCC, the California Public Utilities Commission, and any other agency of the federal or State government with the authority to regulate wireless communications providers and/or wireless communications facilities. If such standards and/or regulations are changed, the permittee and/or wireless communications provider shall bring its facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within ninety calendar days of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal or state agency. Failure to bring wireless communications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the immediate removal of such facilities at the permittee and/or wireless communications provider's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.190 - Severability. 
    In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction holds any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase in this section unconstitutional, preempted, or otherwise invalid, the invalid portion shall be severed from this section and shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this section. The City hereby declares that it would have adopted each section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrases in this section irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases in this section might be declared unconstitutional, preempted, or otherwise invalid. 
(Ord. No. 2226, § 5(Exh. A-1), 9-19-2017) 
21.34.200 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning set forth below, unless the context clearly dictates a different meaning: 
    "Antenna" means a device or system of wires, poles, rods, dishes, discs or similar devices used for the transmission and/or receipt of electromagnetic waves. 
    "Applicable FCC decisions" means the same as defined by California Government Code Section 65964.1(d)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as "In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994 (2009) and In the Matter of Acceleration of Broadband Deployment by Improving Wireless Facilities Siting Policies, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd. 12865 (2014)." 
    "Applicable law" means all applicable federal, state and local law, ordinances, codes, rules, regulations and orders, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
    "Base station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended, which defines that term as follows: a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined as in this chapter or in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9), or any equipment associated with a tower. 
(i)  The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul. 
(ii)  The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including Distributed Antenna Systems and small-cell networks). 
(iii)  The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under 47 C.F.R. §1.40001, supports or houses equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(ii) of 47 C.F.R. §1.40001 that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support. 
(iv)  The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under 47 C.F.R. §1.40001, does not support or house equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(ii) of 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001. 
    "Carefully placed facility" means a facility that is situated in a location which renders a facility virtually imperceptible to the public. As such, the emphasis for this category of stealth facility is on its location as opposed to its design. Carefully placed facilities require no camouflaging or screening, in that existing site features (e.g. buildings, walls, roof parapets, or existing equipment) render such a requirement unnecessary. Successful examples of carefully placed facilities may include those proposed within an existing building (requiring no alteration of existing materials), those sited on the roof of a particularly large or tall building, and those which are flush mounted to an existing high voltage lattice tower and treated to match. 
    "Cell site" means a parcel of real property on which a wireless communications facility is to be located. 
    "CMC" means the Campbell Municipal Code. 
    "Collocation" means: 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), "collocation" means the same as defined in the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the Collocation of Wireless Antennas, 47 CFR pt. 1, App. B, and applicable FCC decisions (including, but not limited to, In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling to Clarify Provisions of Section 332(c)(7)(B), 24 FCC Rcd 13994 (2009)). 
(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to eligible facilities requests, "collocation" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(2), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[t]he mounting or installation of transmission equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes." As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition effectively means "to add" new equipment to an existing facility and does not necessarily refer to more than one wireless facility installed at a single site. 
    "Communications" means any transmission, emission or reception of signals, images and sound or information of any nature by wire, radio, visual or electromagnetic system that work on a "line-of-sight" principle. 
    "Community development director" or "director" means the community development director of the City of Campbell or his or her designee. 
    "Community development department" means the community development department of the City of Campbell. 
    "Completely integrated facility" means a facility that is incorporated into an existing structure or site in a manner which does not result in a new feature being added. This stealth category may result in the removal of existing siding, or materials to achieve RF transparency, provided that the replacement materials match, to the extent feasible, the existing or abutting material. Where an equivalent material match cannot be adequately demonstrated, a stealth facility could propose to completely remove and replace an existing material if doing so serves to achieve a more cohesive design and does not disrupt the design of the building (e.g. the replacement of all roof shingles, as opposed to simply removing/replacing a smaller impacted roof or wall section). 
    "Concealed facility" means any wireless communications facility which results in new site or architectural features being added to a property in a manner which complements, enhances, or seamlessly integrates into their surroundings. Examples of concealed facilities include, but are not limited to the construction of new rooftop, louver, chimney, silo, pole, railing, sign, window, parapets, dormers, steeples, penthouses, water towers, bell towers, artificial trees, and flag poles. 
    "Deemed granted" or "deemed granted status" means a wireless communications facility for which the applicant submitted an application in compliance with the procedures and requirements of this Chapter that was not acted upon within a reasonable period of time in accordance with the time periods and procedures established by applicable FCC decisions (accounting for tolling periods), and satisfied the requirements of CMC Section 21.34.120 (Failure to act and remedies), and as a result had its permit granted by operation of law in accordance with federal and/or state law. 
    "Electromagnetic field (EMF)" means the local electric and magnetic fields that envelop the surrounding space. The most ubiquitous source of electromagnetic fields is from the movement and consumption of electric power, (e.g., transmission lines, household appliances and lighting). 
    "Eligible facilities request" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(3), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving: 
i.  Collocation of new transmission equipment; 
ii.  Removal of transmission equipment; or 
iii.  Replacement of transmission equipment." 
    "Eligible support structure" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(4), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny tower or base station as defined in [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001] provided that it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under [47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001]." 
    "Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(5), as may be amended, which provides that "[a] constructed tower or base station is existing for purposes of the [FCC rules implementing Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act, codified at 47 U.S.C. 1455] if it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this definition." 
    "FCC" means the Federal Communications Commission or any successor to that agency, which has primary regulatory control over communications providers through its powers to control interstate commerce and to provide a comprehensive national system in compliance with the Federal Communications Act. 
    "MPE" means maximum permissible exposure. 
    "Non-commercial communication service" includes amateur (HAM) radio facilities licensed by the FCC, and satellite dish antennas (see CMC Section 21.36.190 (Satellite dish antennas)) and when used for non-commercial exchange of messages, private recreation and emergency communication, except when associated with a wireless communication facility. 
    "RF" means radio frequency. 
    "Section 6409(a)" means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156, codified as 47 U.S.C. Section 1455(a), as may be amended. 
    "Significant gap" is a gap in the service provider's own wireless communications facilities, as defined in federal case law interpretations of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
    "Service provider" means a wireless communications provider, a company or organization, or the agent of a company or organization that provides wireless communications services. 
    "Site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(6), as may be amended, which provides that "[f]or towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground." 
    "Stealth facility" means facilities which result in no perceptible visual impact. As such, stealth facilities are generally preferable to concealed facilities except in rare circumstances when the concealment method serves to improve the aesthetic value or interest to a building or site. There are two primary categories of stealth facilities, those which are completely integrated into an existing structure or architectural feature and those which are imperceptible as a result of careful placement. Both stealth categories require the facility to remain integrated or imperceptible, even when the facility may be expanded upon under the provisions of an eligible facilities request. 
    "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, which defines that term differently based on the particular facility type and location. For clarity, the definition in this chapter organizes the FCC's criteria and thresholds for a substantial change according to the facility type and location. 
1.  For towers outside the public right-of-way, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or the height of one additional antenna array not to exceed twenty feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than twenty feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance (whichever is greater); or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the wireless tower, including any access or utility easements currently related to the site. 
2.  For towers in the public rights-of-way and for all base stations, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification increases the overall height more than ten percent or ten feet (whichever is greater); or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet; or 
c.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of more than the standard number of equipment cabinets for the technology involved, not to exceed four cabinets; or 
d.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground when there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure; or 
e.  The proposed collocation or modification involves the installation of any ground cabinets that are more than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; or 
f.  The proposed collocation or modification involves excavation outside the area in proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on the ground. 
3.  In addition, for all towers and base stations wherever located, a substantial change occurs when: 
a.  The proposed collocation or modification would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support structure as determined by the community development director; or 
b.  The proposed collocation or modification violates a prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not comply with any prior condition of approval related to height, width, equipment cabinets or excavation that is inconsistent with the thresholds for a substantial change described in this section. 
4.  Interpretation of Thresholds. 
a.  The thresholds for a substantial change described above are disjunctive. The failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a substantial change would occur. 
b.  The thresholds for height increases are cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted support structure without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed on February 22, 2012-the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a). 
    "Support Structure" or "Support Structures" means a structure or structures designed to support antenna(s) or other wireless transmission equipment to facilitate the transmitting and/or receiving of radio frequency signals. Support structures include, but are not limited to, masts, monopoles, guyed structures, lattice towers, and other like structures used to support wireless transmission devices. 
    "Temporary wireless communications facility" means a wireless communications facility located on a parcel of land and consisting of a vehicle-mounted facility, a building mounted antenna, or a similar facility, and associated equipment, that is used to provide temporary coverage for a large-scale event or an emergency, or to provide temporary replacement coverage due to the removal of an existing permitted, permanent wireless communications facility necessitated by the demolition or major alteration of a nearby property. 
    "Tower" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001(b)(9), as may be amended, which defines that term as "[a]ny structure built for the sole or primary purpose of supporting any [FCC]- licensed or authorized antennas and their associated facilities, including structures that are constructed for wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul, and the associated site. Examples include, but are not limited to, monopoles, mono-trees and lattice towers. 
    "Transmission equipment" or "wireless transmission equipment" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. Section 140001(b)(8), as may be amended, which defines that term as "equipment that facilitates transmission for any FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communication service, including, but not limited to, radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply. The term includes equipment associated with wireless communications services including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul." 
    "Visual impact" means the placement or design of a wireless communications facility such that it may be noticed by a person of average height when standing on the ground of a street, sidewalk or private property. 
    "Wireless communications facility" means a land use facility supporting antennas that sends and/or receives radio frequency signals, AM/FM, microwave, and/or electromagnetic waves for the purpose of providing voice, data, images or other information, including, but not limited to, cellular and/or digital telephone service, personal communications services, and paging services. Wireless communications facilities include antennas and all other types of equipment for the transmission or receipt of the signals; towers or similar structures built to support the equipment; equipment cabinets, base stations, generators, cables, conduit, and other accessory development and support features; and screening and concealment elements. Also referred to as a "communication facility" or "facility". 
    "Wireless communications provider" means any company or organization that provides or who represents a company or organization that provides wireless communications services.

21.36.200 - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2216, § 5, adopted Dec. 12, 2016, repealed § 21.36.200, which pertained to secondary dwelling units and derived from Ord. 2043, § 1(part), adopted in 2004. 
21.36.205 - Sexually oriented businesses. 
    Community-wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, parks, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of sexually oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this section to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of sexually oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of sexually oriented businesses in certain areas. 
A.  Definitions. 
1.  Municipal Code. As used herein, the terms and phrases shall have the same meaning as defined in Chapter 5.55 of the Municipal Code.

c.  The addition of any of the sexually oriented businesses defined herein to any other existing sexually oriented business; or 
d.  The relocation of any such sexually oriented business. 
B.  Locational requirements. No sexually oriented business shall be established or located in any zone in the city other than the M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district, and shall not be within certain distances of certain specified land uses or zones as set forth below: 
1.  Required distance from other sexually oriented businesses. No such business shall be established or located within three hundred feet of any other sexually oriented business; 
2.  Required distance from other specified uses. No such business shall be established or located within three hundred feet from any existing schools for minors, churches or religious institutions, parks, and residentially zoned districts or uses; and 
3.  Measurement of distance. The distances set forth above shall be measured as a radius from the primary entrance of the sexually oriented business to the property lines of the property so zoned or used without regard to intervening structures. 
C.  Amortization of nonconforming sexually oriented business uses. Any use of real property lawfully existing on the effective date of this section, which does not conform to the provisions of this section, but which was constructed, operated, and maintained in compliance with all previous regulations, shall be regarded as a nonconforming use which may be continued until January 1, 2020. On or before such date, all such nonconforming uses shall be terminated unless an extension of time has been approved by the planning commission in compliance with the provisions of subsection D of this section. 
1.  Abandonment. Notwithstanding the above, any discontinuance or abandonment of the use of any lot or structure as a sexually oriented business shall result in a loss of legal nonconforming status of such use.

1.  Time and manner of application. An application for an extension of time within which to terminate a use made nonconforming by the provisions of subsection C of this section, may be filed by the owner of the real property upon which such use is operated, or by the operator of the use. Such an application must be filed with the community development department at least ninety days but no more than one hundred eighty days prior to the time established in subsection C of this section, for termination of such use. 
2.  Content of application and required fees. The application shall state the grounds for requesting an extension of time. The filing fee for such application shall be the same as that for a variance as is set forth in the schedule of fees established by resolution from time to time by the city council. 
3.  Hearing procedure. A hearing shall set on the matter before the planning commission for within forty-five days of receipt of the application. All parties involved shall have the right to offer testimonial, documentary and tangible evidence bearing on the issues; may be represented by counsel; and shall have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.

21.36.245 - Collection Containers. 
A.  Purpose. The City has experienced a proliferation of Collection Containers and their placement in required parking stalls, required landscaped areas, in residential areas located in many zoning districts of city, often without property owner's permission. The proliferation of these containers in-and-of themselves contribute to visual clutter; and in areas throughout the State, collection containers have contributed blight due to graffiti, and the accumulation of debris and excess items outside of the collection containers. 
    They can also interfere with the proper collection of data concerning the diversion of waste within the City from landfills. The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, and/or welfare of the public, and protect the property rights of the owners of parcels on which the collection containers are located, by providing minimum blight- related performance standards for the operation of collection containers, including establishing criteria to ensure that (1) material is not allowed to accumulate outside of the collection containers, (2) the collection containers remain free of graffiti and blight, (3) the collection containers are maintained in safe and sanitary conditions, (4) the collection containers are not placed without the approval of the property owners, (5) contact information is readily available so that the operators can be contacted if there are any blight-related questions or concerns, and that operators properly report information concerning the diversion of materials from landfills. This section regulates the size, number, placement, installation and maintenance of collection containers, as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing purposes. 
B.  Definition in Municipal Code. As used herein, the terms and phrases shall have the same meaning as defined in Chapter 21.72.020 of the Municipal Code. 
C.  Conflicting Provisions. Where a conflict exists between the regulations or requirements in this section and applicable regulations or requirements contained in other sections of the Campbell Municipal Code, the applicable regulations or requirements of this section shall prevail. 
D.  Permit Requirements. 
1.  Except as provided in paragraph 2. below, it is unlawful to place, operate, maintain or allow a collection container on any real property unless the property owner and operator of the collection container first obtain an annually renewable permit from the City.

F.  Not within community development director's scope. In cases where the community development director considers the information identified in the application not to be within the scope of the community development director's review and approval procedure, the applicant shall be so informed before filing, and if the application is filed, and the fees are accepted, the application shall be signed by the applicant acknowledging prior receipt of this information.

    Before commencing any work pertaining to the alteration, construction, conversion, erection, moving, or reconstruction of any structure, or any addition to any structure, a building permit shall be obtained from the building division and a zoning clearance from the community development department by an owner or agent. It is unlawful to commence any work until all required permits have been obtained. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.40.020 - Applicability/clearance required. 
    A zoning clearance shall be required as part of the community development department's review of any construction permit, change in the type of use, business license (for a land use on the subject site), or other authorization required by the Municipal Code for the proposed use. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.40.030 - Procedure. 
A.  Community development director's action.

B.  Need for on-site inspections. 
1.  When not required. A site inspection is not required for zoning clearances for projects determined by the community development director to be uncomplicated and for which the submitted application materials clearly comply with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Code. 
2.  When required. For projects determined by the community development director to potentially not comply with all applicable requirements of this Zoning Code, or which are proposed on sites or in areas of the city with known problems, the community development director shall perform an on-site inspection before determining that the request complies with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
21.40.040 - Post decision procedures. 
    Pursuant to Chapter 21.62, (Appeals) zoning clearances are ministerial and are not appealable. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1 (part), 2004). 
Chapter 21.41 - PRE-APPLICATIONS 

21.41.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
    This chapter provides procedures and requirements for the preparation, filing, and processing of pre-applications for land use permits and other entitlements required by this zoning code. The intent of this process is to allow the review of significant development applications by the planning commission and/or community development director earlier in the development review process to avail an applicant of the planning commission's and/or community development director's comments and concerns prior to the formal submittal of the land use application. The pre-application process does not replace, but is ancillary to the land use application process and does not result in, nor can the planning commission or community development director, render a decision with regard to land use entitlements. 
(Ord. No. 2122, § 1 (Exh. A), 10-20-2009) 
21.41.020 - Pre-application required. 
A.  Mandatory pre-applications. Any land use proposal that falls into one of the categories listed in the threshold table shall be required to submit a pre-application to the community development department for review and processing, including a mandatory study session before the planning commission, prior to submitting a formal land use application. 
Threshold Table 
Mandatory Pre-applications Thresholds* 1 Proposed Zone Change/General Plan Amendments involving a minimum of one acre. 2 Projects involving over two acres or over 40 dwelling units or 20,000 square feet of building area. 3 Projects resulting in commercial/residential adjacencies on parcels exceeding 20,000 square feet. 4 Potential impacts on infrastructure that result in significant environmental impacts identified in an environmental assessment or substantial fiscal impacts.  
*  Land use permits and other entitlements includes tentative subdivision maps, planned development permits, condominium - planned development permits, zone changes, and general plan amendments, and text amendments. 
(Ord. No. 2122, § 1 (Exh. A), 10-20-2009) 
21.41.030 - Procedure. 
    Application filing, processing, and review. 
A.  Filing. A pre-application shall be filed with the community development department in compliance with Chapter 21.38 (Application Filing, Processing and Fees.) 
B.  Application contents. The application shall include the information and forms provided by the community development department, and all information and materials required by the community development department and director. 
C.  Review by the community development director. 
1.  Mandatory pre-applications. Following receipt of a completed mandatory pre-application, the community development director shall make an investigation of the facts bearing on the project to provide the information necessary for the review of the proposal by the planning commission. The community development director shall then schedule the pre-application as a study session item before the planning commission for review and comment within 60 days. 
D.  Study session: review by the planning commission. 
1.  The planning commission shall provide constructive review of the pre-application and provide feedback and direction to the applicant early in the design review process. 
2.  A public hearing shall not be required for the planning commission's review of a pre-application. 
3.  At the conclusion of the required study session, the applicant may file a formal application as defined under section 21.38.030. 
E.  Advisory comments: community development director and planning commission. The pre-application process does not replace, but is ancillary to, the land use application process and does not result in, nor can the planning commission render a decision with regard to land use entitlements, and nothing contained in the process precludes either the planning commission or city council from approving or denying a subsequent formal land use application. Because the pre-application process does not constitute a formal application review, comments are considered advisory recommendations for the use of the applicant. Any such review or recommendation shall not be binding upon the planning commission or the city council as to any further determinations to be made with respect to the project. 
(Ord. No. 2122, § 1 (Exh. A), 10-20-2009)

Chapter 21.58 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 

21.58.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
A.  Purpose. This chapter establishes regulations for legal nonconforming uses and structures. These are uses and structures within the city that were lawfully established and constructed before the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the current terms of this Zoning Code or future amendments thereto. 
B.  Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to limit the number and extent of nonconforming structures by prohibiting their being altered, enlarged, expanded, intensified, moved, or replaced; and, by prohibiting their restoration after destruction. Eventually, all nonconforming structures are to be eliminated or altered to conform to the zoning district standards in which they are located. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.58.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Nonconforming uses and structures. Nonconforming uses and structures within the city may continue to be used, and may be altered, maintained, expanded, reconstructed, or replaced only as allowed by this chapter. 
B.  City properties. Any property with a nonconforming structure owned in whole or in part by the city of Campbell may continue to be used, and may be altered or expanded if the alterations, additions, or extensions do not extend beyond the boundaries of the original site. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the discontinuance, or removal of a city-owned nonconforming structure. 
C.  Status of designated cultural resource. Designated cultural resources shall not be considered nonconforming or illegal for purposes of maintenance and upkeep. 
D.  Illegal uses, structures, and signs. Uses and structures which did not comply with the applicable provisions of the Municipal Code or the Santa Clara County regulations when originally established, are in violation of this Zoning Code and are subject to the provisions of Chapter 21.70, (Enforcement). This chapter does not grant any right to continue the use or occupancy of property containing an illegal use or structure, or any use or structure that was not legally created. 
E.  Nuisance abatement. In the event that a nonconforming use or structure is found to constitute a public nuisance, appropriate action may be taken by the city, in compliance with Municipal Code Chapter 6.10, (Nuisance Abatement and Property Maintenance Regulations), or other applicable provisions of law. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.58.030 - Definitions. 
    Nonconformities are defined as follows: 
    "Nonconforming structures" means a structure the size, dimensions or location of which was lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this Zoning Code, but which fails by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment to conform to the current requirements of this Zoning Code. 
    "Nonconforming use" means a use or activity which was lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this Zoning Code, but which fails by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment to conform to the current use regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. 
    "Nonconformity upon annexation" means a use, structure, or parcel that legally existed in the unincorporated territory and after annexation does not comply with the provisions of this Zoning Code. 
(Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004). 
21.58.040 - Restrictions on nonconforming uses. 
A.  Purpose. This section is intended to limit the number and extent of nonconforming uses by prohibiting expansion, enlargement, or intensification, re-establishment after abandonment, alteration of the structures they occupy, and restoration after destruction. 
B.  Continuation of Use. 
1.  The nonconforming use of a structure, lawfully established before the enactment of rezoning, reclassification, or change of regulations, may be continued only in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, any motor vehicle repair facility that is nonconforming with regard to the requirements of Section 21.36.140, (Motor vehicle repair facilities), shall come into compliance with all applicable regulations of Section 21.36.140 of this title within twenty-four months of the latter of: 
a.  The effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter adopting this provision; or 
b.  The date that the use became nonconforming. Nothing contained in subsection (B)(2) of this section shall be construed as prohibiting a lawfully established motor vehicle repair facility that is presently nonconforming solely due to the fact that it is not currently a permitted use in the zoning district in which is located from continuing to operate so long as the use complies with the operational requirements of Section 21.36.140 of this title. 
3.  Any late-night activity nonconforming with regard to the requirements of Section 21.12.030(G)(1)(d) (Administrative planned development permit required) requiring an administrative planned development permit, shall come into compliance by obtaining an administrative planned development permit subject to Section 21.12.030 (Planned development zoning district) within twenty-four months of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter adopting this provision. 
C.  Change in Use. 
1.  The nonconforming use of a site or structure may be changed to a use of the same or more restricted classification as determined by the community development director. 
2.  Where the nonconforming use of a site or structure is changed to a use of a lesser intensity, it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of greater intensity. 
D.  Enlargement or Expansion Prohibited. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased to occupy a greater floor area or portion of the site than it lawfully occupied before becoming a nonconforming use. 
E.  Discontinued Use. 
1.  A nonconforming use that is abandoned, discontinued, or has ceased operations for a continuous period of at least twelve months shall not be re-established on the site and further use of the structure or parcel shall comply with all of the regulations of the applicable zoning district and all other applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. 
2.  Evidence of abandonment shall include, but is not limited to, the actual removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, the turning-off of the previously connected utilities, or where there are no business receipts/records available to provide evidence that the use is in continual operation. 
F.  Nonconforming Use of Land. The nonconforming use of land, on which no main structure is located, which was lawfully established before the enactment of zoning, rezoning, reclassification, or change of regulations, may be continued for a period of not more than five years from when it first became nonconforming; provided: 
1.  No nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended either on the same or adjoining property. 
2.  The nonconforming use of land may be changed to a use of the same or lesser intensity (as determined by the community development director) but where the nonconforming use of land is changed to a use of lesser intensity it shall not thereafter be changed to a use of greater intensity. 
3.  A nonconforming use of land that is abandoned or discontinued for a continuous period of at least twelve months shall not be re-established. Any further use of the site thereafter shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code. 
G.  Nonconforming Due to Lack of Conditional Use Permit. A use that is nonconforming due to the lack of a conditional use permit may continue only to the extent that it previously existed (e.g., floor or site area occupied by the use, hours of operation, type or intensity of use). Any change shall require conditional use permit approval. 
H.  Previous Conditional Use Permits in Effect. A use that was established with conditional use permit approval but is a use no longer allowed by this Zoning Code within the applicable zoning district may continue in operation, but only in compliance with all of the provisions of the original conditional use permit. If the conditional use permit specified a termination date, the use shall be discontinued in compliance with that termination date. 
I.  Nonconformance Due to Reclassification. The foregoing provisions of this Zoning Code shall also apply to uses and structures which thereafter become nonconforming due to any reclassification of zoning districts, in compliance with Chapter 21.60, (Amendments) or any subsequent change in the regulations of this chapter; provided, where a period of years is specified in this section for the removal of nonconforming uses or structures the period shall be computed from the date of the reclassification or change. 
(Ord. 2093 § 1(part), 2007; Ord. 2070 § 1 (Exh. A)(part), 2006: Ord. 2043 § 1(part), 2004).
