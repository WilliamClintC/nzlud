(Ord. No. 44-65, 9-20-65; Ord. No. 40-97, § 1, 9-2-97) 
1:210. - Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. 
    There is hereby created an Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. Historically, across the nation, policing has been used as a mechanism for social control by means including racial bias, disparities in police use of force, and the impacts of officer-involved shootings and other violent encounters with law enforcement officers. This fact, combined with ongoing racial discrimination in America today, creates distrust and tension between marginalized populations and law enforcement. 
    The City of Ann Arbor and the Ann Arbor Police Department are committed to building trust and positive relationships with all segments of the community. The city cannot achieve this end without addressing our national history of using the police as a tool to reinforce systems of racial inequity. The formation of the Independent Community Police Oversight Commission is a necessary step in reframing the relationship that the residents of Ann Arbor have with the police and an investment in the smart, equitable, community-oriented policing that the Ann Arbor Police Department strives for and that our community deserves. 
(Ord. No. 18-30, § 1, 10-15-18) 
1:211. - Same-Definitions. 
    For purposes of the ordinance, the following terms shall have the following defined meanings:

(3)  Ordinance means the city ordinance that created the Commission, as amended. 
(4)  Police-related policy means any policy or practice of the Department and any other policy or practice of the city or any of its agencies to the extent that it governs or otherwise bears on the work of the Department. 
(Ord. No. 18-30, § 1, 10-15-18) 
1:212. - Same-Purpose. 
    The Commission has all of the following purposes: 
(1)  To improve and strengthen police-community relations. 
(2)  To create an environment which allows for better communication, understanding, and relations between the Department and the community. 
(3)  To provide the community with a role in recommending policies and practices that ensure a high quality of police services, and to give the community a voice in influencing the selection of leadership for the Department. 
(4)  To provide oversight of the Department with regard to the provision of police services, with the goal that the entire community-meaning everyone who lives, works, studies in, or visits Ann Arbor-may live safely and experience equitable treatment in any interactions with the police. 
(5)  To work with the Department to encourage the respectful treatment of all persons, and without undue use of force. This concern is of special significance with respect to segments of the community that are vulnerable and have been marginalized, such as persons of color, immigrants, low-income people, victims of domestic violence, those who suffer from mental illness, and transgender persons. 
(6)  To provide a process for outside review of particular incidents to evaluate the police response in the incident as well as the sufficiency of any police investigation related to the incident and to recommend any changes in police policies or practices. 
(Ord. No. 18-30, § 1, 10-15-18) 
1:213. - Same-Nature of the Commission.

Reports, recommendations, conclusions, and findings produced by or for the Commission are not binding, factually or legally, on the City or any part thereof, including the Department, the City Administrator, the City Attorney, and the City Council.

Persons who are current employees of the City or who have been employed by the City, including active or former police officers, within 5 years of nomination shall not be eligible for appointment.

An application form shall be posted online and hard copies shall be made available in City Hall. Translation services shall be made available to applicants as necessary. Applicants may also choose to apply by interview completed by Human Rights Commission. Failure to apply shall not disqualify a person from being eligible for appointment.

(3)  Diversity of membership. The Commission, community organizations, and City Council shall endeavor to ensure that (a) the overall membership of the Commission reflects the City's diverse population, including income level, race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, and experience; (b) segments of the community that are vulnerable and have been marginalized, and that tend to have significant negative interactions with the police, are amply represented; and (c) the Commission includes members with a variety of skills, expertise, and life experiences bearing on the work of the Commission, such as people who work or have worked in the fields of mediation, conflict resolution, mental health, housing, homelessness, anti-racist and equity reform, and transformative justice, and people who have had significant experience with the police, law enforcement, and the criminal justice system. 
(4)  Terms. Terms for voting members shall be 3 years, other than any youth member whose term shall be 1 year. Terms shall be staggered so that approximately ? of the voting members' terms expire each year.

(Ord. No. 18-30, § 1, 10-15-18; Ord. No. 19-05, § 1, 3-4-19) 
1:215. - Same-Incident review. 
(1)  Incident review. The Commission shall have the authority to review and examine the actions of the Department with respect to individual incidents after the Department has acted. The review extends to both the conduct of the police officers involved in the incident and to those police officers who examine the incident for disciplinary or other purposes. The Commission's review and examination shall not precede or be concurrent with Department actions, but shall occur after the Department and city have completed all proceedings related to the incident or action under review, including investigative, criminal, disciplinary, complaint, and other proceedings. 
(2)  Filing a complaint. 
(a)  Any individual, whether or not involved in the incident in question and without respect to citizenship or residence, may file a complaint with the Commission or the Department. The Commission shall not inquire about any complainant's immigration status or gender identity. 
(b)  The complaint may be filed in person, by telephone, by e-mail, or by mail. The complaint should contain information about the alleged incident, including location, date and involved police officers, if known. Any complaints received by the city that are addressed to the commission, should be promptly forwarded to the Commission. 
(c)  The complainant may choose to file the complaint anonymously. If filed anonymously, the Commission shall not attempt to determine the identity of the complainant, and shall attempt to communicate with the complainant only if it can do so without learning the complainant's identity. If a complaint is made without revealing the identity of the complainant, the Commission shall treat the complaint as being filed anonymously. A complainant who files anonymously may decide at a later time to reveal the complainant's identity. The fact that a complainant's identity is known to a Commission member shall not prevent the complainant from filing the complaint anonymously. 
(d)  The Commission may also initiate its own review of the Department's complaint disposition in a particular incident or the Department's response to an incident. The Commission's review shall not precede or be concurrent with Department actions, but shall occur after the Department and city have completed all proceedings related to the complaint disposition under review, including investigative, criminal, disciplinary, complaint, and other proceedings. 
(e)  There is no time limit for filing a complaint or for initiation of review of an incident. The Commission will exercise appropriate caution in reviewing an incident that is not recent, but it shall act on the recognition that no matter how old an incident is it may hold lessons for the future. 
(f)  A person who wishes to transmit information to the Commission or city, but does not wish to file a complaint or contact the Commission or city directly, may contact a community liaison designated by the Commission under the ordinance. 
(3)  Complaint procedure. 
(a)  Upon receipt of a complaint, the Commission will review the complaint and timely provide a copy of the complaint to the Department's Professional Standards Section. To the extent the complaint or inquiry concerns conduct of the Police Chief, the matter shall be referred to the City Administrator. If a complaint does not allege officer misconduct, but relates only to Police-related Policy, the Commission may review the complaint in accordance with section 1:216 without immediate referral to the department. 
(b)  Upon referral, if a complainant expresses to the Commission that the complainant is not seeking discipline of the police officer, that information shall be communicated to the Department's Professional Standards Section Lieutenant. The Department should consider the complainant's request when taking any remedial action. 
(c)  The Police Chief will provide status updates regarding the investigation to the Commission. The Commission may serve as a point of contact for the complainant throughout the investigation and review process, and provide the complainant updates as to the progress. 
(d)  A complainant may be accompanied or assisted throughout the investigation or review process by an advocate, attorney, or other representative of the complainant's choosing. 
(e)  Upon closure of its internal investigation of a complaint referred by the Commission, the Police Chief shall issue a report to the Commission in accordance with the ordinance. 
(f)  A complainant and any involved police officer will have the option of appearing before the Commission, or the members of the Commission designated to act on the complaint, during the Commission's review of the incident. 
(g)  Relevant to the complaint, the Commission may review the actions of the Department and any involved police officer and take appropriate action, including, but not limited to: 
i.  Gathering information from the complainant, willing third parties, and publicly available sources; 
ii.  Questioning the Police Chief, Deputy Police Chief, or Professional Standards Section Lieutenant about the investigation; 
iii.  Informally mediating the matter by facilitating sessions in which persons involved in the incident and others with an interest in it (including representatives of the Department) can participate on a voluntary basis, the aim being to achieve fuller mutual understanding without recrimination. Upon mutual agreement of all necessary parties, the city and Commission may establish a dispute resolution process where complaints are resolved without going through the Department's disciplinary process; and 
iv.  Using information learned to make policy recommendations to the Department and city.

(1)  Building community relations. For the Department to be able to perform its vital function in a way that is both effective and equitable to all segments of the community, especially those segments of the community that are vulnerable and marginalized, it is crucial that there be increased understanding of the needs of those particular community groups by the Department. The Commission shall be proactive in discharging its responsibilities of fostering better communications and understanding between the Department and community, and of ensuring that its complaint procedure is known to the community as open and accessible to the public. The Commission may take any action not prohibited by law that, in its discretion, it believes will help it do so. Such actions may include, without limitation, convening advisory boards, host listening sessions, discussion circles, and educational sessions with community groups and with the community at large, with or without police participation, based on the preferences of each community group. In conducting these actions, the Commission: 
(a)  Shall seek input from a broad representation of the aforementioned community groups, including but not limited to youth of color; adults of color, particularly black men; persons living with mental illness; formerly incarcerated persons; persons who have had adverse interactions with the Department; persons living with persistent economic hardship; transgendered persons; and persons with immigrant status; 
(b)  Shall consider whether information that it learns from these actions suggests that it should make any recommendations as to changes in practices and policies bearing on the city's exercise of the policing function; 
(c)  Shall, through the youth liaison, work with the youth commission member and either an existing or Commission-created youth council to incorporate a youth perspective into the Commission's decisions and recommendations, organize events that are youth-oriented, and secure the participation of youth in other events as appropriate;

In identifying community liaisons, the Commission shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the liaisons will: 
(a)  Be publicly available to any person wishing to provide information; 
(b)  Be available to provide the Commission with regular updates regarding all information received related to their role as a community liaison; 
(c)  To the best of their ability, accurately report the information received; and 
(d)  Understanding that the information the liaison provides to the Commission is likely to be a public record, protect the identity or confidential information of a person who provides information, unless the person expressly authorizes otherwise. 
    The Commission may evaluate whether and to what extent any of the information received from a community liaison warrants further review, discussion, or response by the Commission, bearing in mind that the Commission likely will not have access to first-hand information.

1:218. - Consultation on leadership.

Within the Commission's designated budget, the Commission may seek additional professional services, to the extent the contract for those services is approved in accordance with city procurement procedures.

The City Administrator shall ensure that the commission has access to the contracted services in order to fulfill the purpose of the contract. 
(3)  Counsel. The Commission may request outside counsel and the City Council may retain outside counsel to assist the Commission pursuant to the City Charter.

1:301. - Deficiency assessments and refunds. 
    Should the assessments in any special assessment roll, including the city's share, prove insufficient for any reason to pay the cost of the local public improvement for which they were made, then the City Council may make additional assessments against the city and the several lots and tax parcels within the special assessment district; and shall assess to each lot or tax parcel the relative portion of the whole sum to be levied against all the lands in the special assessment district as the benefit to each lot or tax parcel bears to the total benefits to all lots or tax parcels in the district; or the City Council may determine that the deficiency shall be paid by the city but the total amount assessed against any lot or tax parcel shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement. In the event the deficiency assessment to be levied against the benefiting lot or tax parcel as described above exceeds the original estimated cost by 15% or more, City Council shall order a public hearing with the notice of the hearing to be as described in section 1:289 of the chapter. The hearing shall be conducted upon the spread of the deficiency as determined by the final cost certified to City Council by the City Administrator as provided in section 1:300 of this chapter. Should the assessments levied prove to be more than necessary to defray the cost of the local public improvement, then the City Council may, by resolution, order the excess to be applied to the next unpaid installment of the special assessment against each lot or parcel. Any excess as to any lot or tax parcel of land which cannot be applied as described may be refunded in cash to the persons who are the record owners of the properties on the date of the passage of the resolution ordering the refund.

1:302. - Reassessment in event of illegality. 
    Whenever any special assessment shall, in the opinion of the Council be invalid by reason of irregularity or informality in the proceedings, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge the assessment to be illegal, the Council shall, whether the improvement has been made or not, or whether any part of the assessment has been paid or not, have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the collection of it shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment, and whenever the assessment, or any part of it, levied upon any premises has been set aside, if the assessment has been paid and not refunded, the payment made shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. 
(Ord. No. 10-00, § 1, 3-6-00) 
1:303. - Collection by court action. 
    In addition to any other remedies and without impairing the lien, any delinquent special assessment, together with interest and penalties, may be collected in an action in assumpsit in the name of the city against the person assessed, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount. If in any action it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities the assessment has not been properly made against the defendant or upon the lots or tax parcels sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, on satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the city which is a proper charge against the defendant or the lots or tax parcels in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against the defendant or upon the lots or tax parcels.

1:551. - Existing system. 
    The City of Ann Arbor Employees Retirement System (the "Retirement System" or "Retirement Ordinance"), as previously established for the purpose of providing Retirement Allowances to certain City employees and retired employees of the City and survivor benefits to their eligible beneficiaries, has been maintained continuously subject to certain amendments in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Ann Arbor City Charter. All rights and benefits heretofore accruing to any person under a previous City Retirement System shall remain in full force and effect. 
    Effective January 1, 2017, the Retirement System is amended and restated to add to the existing defined benefit plan (to be called the "Traditional Retirement Plan"), a defined contribution money purchase pension plan (the "Dual Retirement Plan") which will only apply to non-union, AFSCME, and Teamsters Civilian Supervisor employees first hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Employees who are members of the Dual Retirement Plan will also participate in and accrue benefits under the Traditional Retirement Plan, but at a rate of accruals that is 50% of the rate of accruals for members of the Traditional Retirement Plan who were not first hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Certain collective bargaining units may agree that newly hired or rehired members of that union will be covered by the Dual Retirement Plan on dates after January 1, 2017, as set forth in this chapter from time to time. The Traditional Retirement Plan and the Dual Retirement Plan are together called the City of Ann Arbor Employees Retirement System. The Traditional Retirement Plan is contained in sections 1:553 through 1:577 of this chapter, the Dual Retirement Plan is contained in sections 1:601 through 1:612, and provisions which apply to both plans are contained in sections 1:552.1 through 1:555.3 (definitions) and 1:620 through 1:639. 
    The City now wishes to amend and restate the Retirement Ordinance in its entirety as hereinafter set forth. The provisions of the amended and restated Retirement Ordinance shall apply only to a Member who accrues Service on or after January 1, 2017, except as otherwise specified herein. If a Member (or person claiming a benefit with respect to a Member, as applicable) terminated employment, died, became disabled, or otherwise became entitled to a benefit prior to January 1, 2017 (or other specified effective date), benefits under the Retirement System shall be determined and paid in accordance with the Retirement Ordinance as in effect as of the date such termination of employment, death or disability, or other benefit entitlement occurred.

(2)  9-23 calendar days-Member receives 0.50 month (1/2 month) service credit; or

During the period of such uniformed service, and until return to City service, the Member's contributions to the Annuity Savings Fund shall be suspended and the balance therein shall be accumulated with interest thereon, at the Accumulated Contribution Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(2).

(6)  Only military service of Members who spent time in the armed services of the United States as indicated as active service on the Member's military service separation papers (DD-214 or equivalent form) shall qualify for purchase.

(7)  The provisions of this section 1:555(c) shall not apply to Credited Service or benefits under the Dual Retirement Plan. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any provision of the Retirement Ordinance to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with IRC § 414(u) and regulations thereunder.

The City recognizes service under the RRA only for eligibility and for purposes of determining the early retirement reduction factors. The provisions of the RRA are incorporated into this Retirement Ordinance by reference as though fully set forth herein. 
(h)  Service-Temporary Employment. A Member may elect to receive Service for periods of temporary employment leading directly to permanent employment with the City by agreeing to pay into Annuity Savings Fund an amount equal to the Accumulated Contributions that would have been required and accrued as if such person had been a Member of the Retirement System during the period of temporary employment. The election must be made within 60 days after (a) obtaining permanent status and (b) being notified by the Board of the right to make such election. Temporary service in a student training or student intern program or on a contractual basis is not eligible for Service credit under this section.

1:559. - Alternate forms of payment options-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
(1)  Prior to the effective date of the Member's Normal, Early, Disability, or Deferred Vested Retirement, but not thereafter, a Member may, in lieu of being paid a straight life Retirement Allowance for his/her life pursuant to section 1:557(1), elect to receive the Actuarial Equivalent of the straight life Retirement Allowance, computed as of the effective date of his Retirement, in the form of a reduced Retirement Allowance Payment Option as described under Options I, II, III, IV or V below. 
Option I-Modified Cash Refund. A Retirant shall be paid a reduced Retirement Allowance for life with the provision that upon the Retirant's death, the difference, if any, between the Retirant's Accumulated Contributions at the time of Retirement and the aggregate amount of cash refund annuity payments (as defined below) made shall be paid to such person or persons as he/she shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board. If no such designated person survives the Retirant, then such difference, if any, shall be paid to his or her legal representatives. As used in this Option, the term "annuity payments" means the portion of the Retirant's Retirement Allowance derived from the Retirant's Accumulated Contributions at the time of Retirement, as determined by the actuary. 
Option II-100% Survivor. A Retirant shall be paid a reduced Retirement Allowance for life with the provision that upon the death of a Retirant, the reduced Retirement Allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as the Retirant shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board prior to the effective date of Retirement. If the nominated survivor Beneficiary dies prior to the Retirant, the amount of the Retirant's monthly Retirement Allowance shall revert to the straight life Retirement Allowance amount described in (1) above and shall be paid to the Retirant for the remainder of his life. If both the Retirant and Beneficiary die before receiving an aggregate amount of Retirement Allowance payments equal to the Member's Accumulated Contributions at Retirement, as reduced by any payment under section 1:559(2), the difference, if any, between said Retirant's Accumulated Contributions and the aggregate amount of Retirement Allowance paid, shall be paid from the Pension Reserve Fund to the legal representative of the Retirant or Beneficiary, whomever died last. 
Option III-50% Survivor. A Retirant shall be paid a reduced Retirement Allowance for life with the provision that upon the death of a Retirant, 1/2 the reduced Retirement Allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as the Retirant shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Board prior to the effective date of Retirement. If the nominated survivor Beneficiary dies prior to the Retirant, the amount of the Retirant's monthly Retirement Allowance shall revert to the straight life Retirement Allowance amount described in (1) above and shall be paid to the Retirant for the remainder of his life. If both the Retirant and Beneficiary die before receiving an aggregate amount of Retirement Allowance payments equal to the Member's Accumulated Contributions at Retirement, as reduced by any payment under section 1:559(2), the difference, if any, between said Retirant's Accumulated Contributions and the aggregate amount of Retirement Allowance paid, shall be paid from the Pension Reserve Fund to the legal representative of the Retirant or Beneficiary, whomever died last. 
Option IV-Period Certain of 60, 120 or 180 Monthly Payments. This provision shall apply to Members of the Retirement System who commence to receive a Retirement Allowance on or after February 1, 2011. A Retirant shall be paid a reduced Retirement Allowance payable for life with the provision that upon the Retirant's death before receiving 60, 120 or 180 monthly Retirement Allowance payments as so elected by the Retirant, the monthly payment shall be continued to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in equal shares (including any contingent Beneficiary or Beneficiaries after the death of the first named survivor Beneficiary) as the Retirant shall have designated on a form and filed with the Board of Trustees until a total of 60, 120 or 180 monthly payments have been made. Should the death of the Retirant and all designated Beneficiaries occur before the period certain number of payments elected by the Retirant have been made, the actuarial present value of the remaining period certain payments shall be paid in a lump sum to the legal representative of the last to survive of the Retirant and the named Beneficiary, or if there shall be no such legal representative duly appointed and qualified within 6 months of the date of death of such last survivor, then such persons as, at the date of death of such last survivor, would be entitled to share in the distribution of such last survivor's estate under the provisions of the statute governing intestate succession, then in force and effect in the State of Michigan. 
Option V-Social Security Adjustment Option. A General City Member who retires prior to the age the General City Member becomes entitled to full social security benefits may elect to be paid a straight life Retirement Allowance actuarially equated to provide an increased Retirement Allowance payable to the aforementioned age and a reduced Retirement Allowance thereafter. The Retirant's increased Retirement Allowance, payable to such age, shall approximate the sum of the reduced Retirement Allowance to be payable after that age, and the primary social security benefits to which the Retirant will be entitled. 
    If a Retirant receiving a reduced Retirement Allowance under Option II or Option III is subsequently divorced from the Spouse who is the designated survivor Beneficiary, the election of a reduced Retirement Allowance form of payment shall be considered void by the Retirement System if the judgment of divorce, award, or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court provides that the election of a reduced Retirement Allowance form of payment under Option II or Option III is to be considered void by the Retirement System and the Retirant provides a certified copy of the judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, or an amended judgment of divorce or award or order of the court, to the Retirement System. If the Retirant's election of payment under Option II or Option III is considered void by the Retirement System under this paragraph, the Retirant's Retirement Allowance shall revert to a straight life Retirement Allowance effective the first of the month following the date the Retirement System receives a certified copy of the judgment of divorce, award, or order of the court. This paragraph does not supersede a judgment of divorce, award, or order of the court in effect on the effective date of the amendatory Ordinance that added this paragraph. This paragraph does not require the Retirement System to distribute or pay Retirement Assets on behalf of a Retirant in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if a judgment of divorce had not been rendered. 
    If a Retirant receiving a reduced Retirement Allowance Payment Option II or Option III under section 1:559(1) is separated from the Retirant's named Beneficiary who, at the time of retirement, satisfied the City's "Other Qualified Adult" criteria as described in section 1:552.2(5), the Retirant's election of the reduced Retirement Allowance Payment Option II or Option III shall be considered void by the Retirement System provided that the Retirant files a sworn affidavit with the Board declaring that the named Beneficiary no longer satisfies the City's "Other Qualified Adult" criteria and requests that the reduced Retirement Allowance Payment Option II or Option III be considered void by the Retirement System. If the Retirant's form of benefit payment under Option II or Option III is considered void by the Retirement System under this paragraph, the Retirant's form of benefit payment shall revert to a straight life retirement allowance, effective the first of the month following the date the Board receives and files the sworn affidavit with the Retirement System. In no event shall this paragraph require the Retirement System to distribute or pay the Retirant retirement assets in an amount that exceeds the actuarially determined amount that would otherwise become payable if the affidavit had not been tendered to the Board. This paragraph shall apply only to Members of the AFSCME bargaining unit retiring on or after August 29, 2011, Members of the Ann Arbor Police Officers Association retiring on or after July 1, 2012, or Command Officers Association Members retiring on or after April 26, 2012.

(b)  The election by a Terminated Vested Member whose age and Service total at least 50 at the time of termination of employment to make a partial or 100% withdrawal of Accumulated Contributions as provided in section 1:559(2)(a) may generally be exercised only (i) at the time a Member terminates employment with the City, or (ii) when payment of a Retirement Allowance begins. An election by a Member to withdraw Accumulated Contributions other than at the times described in (i) or (ii), shall require that the Member withdraw 100% of the balance of the Member's Accumulated Contributions credited to the Member's individual account in lieu of any partial withdrawal option of 25%, 50%, or 75% of his Accumulated Contributions. 
(c)  Effective as of February 1, 2011, if a Member withdraws Accumulated Contributions pursuant to this section 1:559(2), the Member's straight life Retirement Allowance shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of the amounts withdrawn.

(ii)  The resulting single sum shall be converted to an Actuarially Equivalent amount of straight life Normal Retirement Allowance using the 1971 group annuity mortality table for males set back (0 years for males and 5 years for females) blended 95% male and 5% female mortality table and 7% interest factors, provided that in the case of a withdrawal under section 1:559(2)(a)(iii) such conversion shall be performed using the 1971 group annuity mortality table for males, set forward 10 years for males and set back 5 years for females, blended 95% male and 5% female. 
(d)  The Actuarial Equivalency Interest Rate provision of section 1:559(2)(c) shall also apply to deferral periods on or after February 1, 2011 for Annuity withdrawals which occurred prior to that date. The interest rate applied to such withdrawals prior to February 1, 2011, shall be at the rates of Regular Interest as previously provided under the Ordinance and as determined by the Board through this date. For purposes of this subparagraph (d), the term "Regular Interest" shall mean that as previously provided under the prior Ordinance for the period through January 31, 2011.

    The contributions so picked up shall be treated as City contributions in determining tax treatment under the Code. The City shall pick up the mandatory Member contributions from funds established and available for the salaries of Members in the groups listed in the chart, which funds would otherwise have been designated as Member contributions and paid to the pension fund. Member contributions picked up by the City pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other purposes of this and other laws of the City in the same manner and to the same extent as Member contributions made on an after-tax basis made prior to the effective date of this subsection. The Member contributions so picked up shall not be included in gross income for tax purposes until such time as they are distributed by refund or benefit payment. 
(d)  Separate Accounting for Member Contributions . Monies contributed under subsection (b), including those "picked up" under subsection (c) shall be accounted for by Members of each Member group, so as to separately reflect each Member's after-tax Accumulated Contributions (and interest thereon, at the Accumulated Contribution Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(2) applicable thereto) and pick-up Accumulated Contributions (and the interest thereon, at the Accumulated Contribution Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(2) applicable thereto). 
(e)  Timing of Member Contributions . The officer or officers responsible for making up the payroll shall cause the contributions provided for in this section to be deducted from the Compensations of each Member on each and every payroll, for each and every payroll period so long as such Member remains a Member in the employ of the City. The Member's contributions provided for herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any Member shall be changed thereby. Every Member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein and payment of Compensation less said deductions shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by said person during the period covered by such payment, except as to benefits provided by this chapter. The amount of contributions to be deducted from the Compensation of each Member for each and every payroll when deducted shall be paid to the Retirement System and shall be credited to the individual Annuity Savings Fund account of the Member from whose Compensation the deduction was made. 
(f)  Repayment of Withdrawn Member Contributions . In addition to the Member contributions, as provided in (b) above, a Member shall deposit in the Annuity Savings Fund, by a single contribution or by an increased rate of contribution as approved by the Board, all amounts previously withdrawn from, and not repaid to, the Annuity Savings Fund, together with interest computed from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment of Accumulated Contributions at the Accumulated Contribution Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(2). An agreement to repay must be signed by the Member by November 1, 1980, or within 1 year of the Member's return to City employment, whichever is later, and repayment with interest must be made by means of contributions at not less than double the amounts required by section 1:565(b). When such an agreement is signed, Service shall be reinstated in accordance with section 1:554.

(g)  Transfer to Retirement Reserve Fund. Upon retirement, the balance of Accumulated Contributions of any Member shall be transferred from the Annuity Savings Fund to the Retirement Reserve Fund. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:566. - Other Operating Funds-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
(1)  The Retirement Reserve Fund is the accounting Fund from which shall be paid all Annuities and Pensions payable as provided in this chapter. Should a disability Retirant return to active Service in the employ of the City, the Retirant's Annuity Reserve at that time shall be transferred from the Retirement Reserve Fund to the Annuity Savings Fund and shall be credited to the Retirant's individual account therein and the Retirant's Pension Reserve at that time shall be transferred from the Retirement Reserve Fund to the Pension Reserve Fund. 
(2)  Effective June 30, 1975, the Board shall establish a pension adjustment account within the Retirement Reserve Fund. The initial account balance shall be $1,078,288.00. Each June 30 thereafter continuing through June 30, 2011, the account shall be increased by the positive difference or decreased by the negative difference, as the case may be, between the balance in the Retirement Reserve Fund after credited interest at the Funding Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(22) and additional interest, if any, as provided by subsection 1:567(1) and the sum of (1) the balance in the pension adjustment account; (2) the Annuity and Pension Reserve for Annuities and Pensions being paid Retirants and Beneficiaries; and (3) the Pension Contingency Reserve. Each July 1 thereafter continuing through June 30, 2011, the account shall be reduced by the Pension Reserve for the pension adjustment, if any, which became effective as of July 1, pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of section 1:574. 
(3)  Effective July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, the Pension Adjustment Account shall be the account to which a percentage of excess earnings shall be credited and interest accrued, both as provided herein, and to which distributions under section 1:574 shall be charged. "Excess earnings," as used herein, shall mean the excess, if any, of (1) the recognized rate of return on the actuarial value of Retirement System Assets, greater than (2) 3/4 of 1 percent (.75%) over the actuarial assumed rate of return, multiplied by (3) the actuarial present value of benefits being paid retired Members and survivor beneficiaries, as reported in the annual actuarial valuation. Commencing with the actuarial report dated June 30, 2011, upon receipt of the annual actuarial valuation for each fiscal year (July 1-June 30), the Board shall credit the Pension Adjustment Account at the end of the then current fiscal year, with the excess earnings, if any, earned in the prior fiscal year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board shall credit no excess earnings to the pension adjustment account in any fiscal year in which the City funded status of the Retirement System is below 100% based upon the Actuarial funded status. 
(a)  Prior to crediting of the prior year's excess earnings, the balance in the Pension Adjustment Account as of the last day of the fiscal year shall be credited with the interest based upon the recognized rate of return on the Actuarial Value of Retirement System Assets for the prior fiscal year; however, said recognized rate of return shall not be greater than the actuarially assumed rate of investment return. 
(b)  The balance in the Pension Adjustment Account after crediting of the prior year's excess earnings shall not exceed an amount equal to the total amount of the pension benefits paid by the Retirement System to retirees and beneficiaries in the prior fiscal year as reflected in the annual actuarial report. 
(c)  The aggregate cost of pension benefit adjustments and supplemental benefit distributions pursuant to subsection 1:574(2) shall be charged to the Pension Adjustment Account. 
(4)  The Pension Reserve Fund shall be the Fund in which shall be accumulated reserves for the payment of all pensions payable from Funds provided by the City. Upon the basis of such mortality and other experience tables and interest at the Funding Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(22), the actuary shall annually compute the pension reserve (1) for pensions being paid Retirants and Beneficiaries, and (2) covering Service rendered and to be rendered by Members. The said pension reserves shall be financed by annual appropriations to be made by the City Council, determined according to subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this subsection. 
(a)  The appropriation for Members' current Service shall be a percent of their annual Compensations which will produce an amount which, if paid annually by the City during their future Service, and taking into account actuarial gains and funding credits as determined by the actuary, will be sufficient to provide the reserves, at the time of their Retirements for the portions of the pensions to be paid them based upon their future Service; and 
(b)  The appropriation for Members' accrued Service shall be a percent of their annual Compensations which will produce an amount which, if paid annually by the City over a period of years to be determined by the Board, and taking into account actuarial gains and funding credits as determined by the actuary, will amortize, at the Funding Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(22), the unfunded pension reserves for the accrued Service portions of the pensions to which they may be entitled; and 
(c)  The appropriation for pensions being paid Retirants and Beneficiaries shall be a percent of the annual Compensations of Members which will produce an amount which, if paid annually by the City over a period of years to be determined by the Board, and taking into account actuarial gains and funding credits as determined by the actuary, will amortize, at the Funding Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(22), the unfunded pension reserves for pensions being paid Retirants and Beneficiaries. 
(d)  All Pensions shall be paid from the Retirement Reserve Fund. Upon the Retirement of a Member or at the time a pension becomes payable to a Beneficiary on account of the death of a Member, the reserve for such pension shall be transferred from the Pension Reserve Fund to the Retirement Reserve Fund. The Board may from time to time transfer from the Pension Reserve Fund to the Retirement Reserve Fund such additional amounts as it determines to be necessary for the proper maintenance of the Retirement Reserve Fund. 
(e)  In the event the amounts appropriated in the budget in any year are insufficient to pay in full the amounts due in said year to all Retirants and Beneficiaries of the Retirement System, the amount of such insufficiency shall thereupon be provided by the appropriating authorities of the City. 
(f)  The maintenance of the various Funds of the Retirement System set forth and required in this chapter shall be interpreted to refer to the accounting Fund of the Retirement System and shall not require the actual segregation of assets in the various accounting Funds of the Retirement System. 
(5)  The Board shall annually certify to the City Council, according to the established City budget procedure, the amount of the City's annual contribution, as determined by the annual valuation by the Retirement System's actuary, to Fund the Retirement System during the ensuing fiscal year and the City shall appropriate and pay such amount to the Retirement System. The City shall remit such payment no later than June 30 of the Plan Year to which the annual contribution applies. 
(6)  The Board shall annually prepare a budget and a budget statement which shall explain the budget and shall contain an outline and explanation of the proposed financial policies of the Board relating to its current and future investment operations. The budget as approved by the Board shall be submitted to City Council for reporting purposes in accordance with applicable law. Payment for all expenses necessary in connection with the administration and operation of the Retirement System shall be paid from the earnings of the Retirement System in accordance with applicable law. The Board shall have the sole authority to enter into contracts and make expenditures for the Retirement System. 
(7)  The Retirement System shall publish and make available a summary annual report available to the Members, Retirants and Beneficiaries, and the general public. The financial records of the Retirement System shall be subject to the annual audit of the City. The Board shall fully comply with all applicable statutory and municipal budgetary and accounting procedures and provide access to and/or documentation of all revenues from all sources, the amount of expenditures for each purpose, the amount of indebtedness, the Fund balances at the close of each fiscal year, and any other information as may be required by law as part of the City's annual financial report to the state treasurer. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:567. - Interest Allowable-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
(1)  The Board shall, at the end of each fiscal year, allow and credit (a) interest at the Accumulated Contribution Interest Rate set forth in section 1:552.1(2) on a Member's individual balances in the Annuity Savings Fund at the beginning of the fiscal year and (b) interest at the Funding Interest Rate as set forth in section 1:552.1(22), on the mean balance in the Retirement Reserve Fund (including the pension adjustment account) during the fiscal year. At the end of each fiscal year, the Board shall review the 5-year moving average annual total return rate on the investments of the Retirement System, and also the actuarial funded status of the Retirement System. On the basis of this review, the Board shall decide whether any additional interest shall be credited to the Retirement Reserve Fund. 
    The amounts so credited as provided in this subsection shall be charged to the undistributed investment income account within the Pension Reserve Fund. 
(2)  All investment income realized on the monies and investments of the Retirement System shall be credited to the undistributed investment income account of the Pension Reserve Fund. If the balance in the account at the end of the fiscal year is insufficient to credit the amounts stipulated in subsection (1), the difference shall be charged to the Pension Reserve Fund. Any balance remaining in the account after crediting all amounts stipulated in subsection (1) shall be closed to the Pension Reserve Fund. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:568. - Actuarial Funding Assumptions, Tables and Factors-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
    The Retirement System shall be funded on an actuarial basis as set forth in the Retirement Ordinance and in accordance with Michigan Constitution of 1963 Article 9, Section 24 and Michigan Public Act 314 of 1965 (MCLA Section 38.1132 et seq.). After consultation with an actuary, the Board shall adopt such mortality and other tables of experience as are necessary for the funding of the Retirement System on an actuarial basis. 
    City contributions shall be determined by an annual actuarial valuation using reasonable actuarial cost methods, interest assumptions, mortality and other experience assumptions that meet the standards of the Actuarial Standards Board/American Academy of Actuaries. 
    The Board shall review the actuarial funding assumptions used to fund the Retirement System. Such review shall occur not less frequently than once every 6 years and may occur more frequently if the Board determines that extraordinary actuarial experience or other changed circumstances should call for an earlier review. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:569. - Other Provisions of Law, Charter or Ordinance-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
(a)  The former police and Fire Retirement Plans having been repealed by the electors of the City at the election held on November 5, 1946, the amounts contributed either directly by or through the efforts of Members, plus interest at 21/2% per annum, compounded annually, shall remain as a credit to each Member's Annuity Savings Fund account, according to the ratio that his own contributions from salary bear to the total contributions of all present Members from salary. The remainder, having been paid into the Pension Reserve Fund, shall remain a part thereof. 
(b)  The pension of Retired Members of the Police and Fire Retirement Plan in effect prior to November 5, 1946, shall be computed according to section 1:557 of this chapter and shall be paid from the Pension Reserve Fund from Funds transferred thereto from the Police and Fire Retirement Plan. If this amount is insufficient, the remainder shall be paid by direct appropriation. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:570. - Special Tax-Traditional Retirement Plan. 
    For the purposes of creating and maintaining a Fund for the payment of the pensions and benefits hereunder, the City Council shall cause to be levied each year a tax not to exceed 21/2 mills on all taxable real estate and personal property situated within the City. This tax shall be in addition to any other limitation imposed on the tax rates of the City by charter provision or by state law. In the annual budget the revenues from the imposition of this tax will be applied to the Pension Reserve Fund of the Retirement System before said revenues are used for any other benefits, including but not limited to insurance benefits. Funding of the Retirement System shall be sufficient to satisfy legal requirements. In the annual budget, the administrator shall review and explain the funding contribution to the Pension Reserve Fund recommended by the Board of Trustees of the City of Ann Arbor Employees Retirement System. 
    The City Council shall appropriate from the revenues of this tax and contribute to the Pension Reserve Fund, at a minimum, an actuarially determined amount that will ensure Funds are sufficient to cover pensions earned by active Members for Services to be performed in the current year, pensions earned by active Members for Services already performed, and actual pensions to be paid to Retirants, as further provided in this chapter. In the event the City Council appropriates an amount different from that recommended by the Board, the City Council shall meet with the Board to discuss the appropriation.

For purposes of this subsection 1:571(2), a "Dispatch Consolidation Member" shall mean: a former eligible General City Member who was a dispatch employee of the City who, as a result of the City's 2011 dispatch contract with Washtenaw County (as approved by City Council on December 5, 2011), terminated employment with the City and commenced employment with Washtenaw County dispatch between September 1, 2011 and July 1, 2012, and who would have been eligible for Early Retirement or Normal Retirement within 10 years of the date of termination of employment with the City if they had remained employed with the City. 
(b)  Provisions of dispatch consolidation program applicable to the Retirement System.

The limitations of Code Section 415, as from time to time amended and adjusted, are hereby incorporated by reference. In applying such limitations, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Without limiting the foregoing, annual adjustments to the limitations of Code Section 415 that are made pursuant to Section 415(d) shall be taken into account in applying subsection (e), to the maximum extent permissible under § 1.415(d)-1 of the Income Tax Regulations. 
(b)  For purposes of this subsection (1) only, where separate governmental plans are maintained by different governmental units, such units are treated, along with the employer that adopts this Retirement Ordinance, as a single "Employer" in accordance with the aggregation requirement under Code Section 415(f) (as modified by Code Section 415(h)), pursuant to a reasonable and good faith interpretation of the rules and definitions under Code Section 415 and Sections 414(b), (c), (m) and (o) of the Code. 
(c)  Where the Member's Employer-provided benefits (determined as of the same age) under all plans required to be aggregated with this Retirement Ordinance for the purposes of Code Section 415 would exceed the limitations of Code Section 415 as applicable to a government plan, then benefits will be reduced plan by plan, until the limitations of Code Section 415 are no longer exceeded, in reverse order of the Member's initial participation date thereunder, beginning with the plan under which the Participant's participation began most recently. If a Member commenced participation in 2 or more such plans on the same date, benefits under those plans shall be reduced in alphabetical order, beginning with the plan whose name is first alphabetically. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section (1) shall reduce benefits accrued by a Member under the Retirement Ordinance as of December 31, 2007, pursuant to Retirement Ordinance provisions that were adopted and in effect before April 5, 2007, if such Retirement Ordinance provisions met the applicable requirements of statutory provisions, regulations, and other published guidance relating to Code Section 415 in effect as of December 31, 2007 (the "Pre- Amendment Provisions"). In addition, nothing in this section (1) shall reduce the benefits that would have been accrued by a Member under the Retirement Ordinance immediately prior to July 14, 2009 pursuant to the Pre-Amendment Provisions; provided, that this sentence shall apply only to the extent that such benefits would otherwise be reduced, under the provisions of section (1) as in effect after July 13, 2009, by reason of a change in the provisions of section (e) that was not legally required in order to comply with Section 415 of the Code or the final regulations promulgated thereunder 
(e)  Where an annual increase under Code Section 415(d) is made to the dollar limitation described in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) effective after a Member's severance from employment with the Employer (or, if earlier, after the Retirement Allowance starting date in the case of a Member who has commenced receiving benefits), such annual increase shall apply, in calculating the limitations applicable to such Member's benefits. 
(f)  The Board will advise affected Members of any adjustments to their Accrued Benefit required by the limitations under this section. 
(g)  The Code Section 415(c)(3) definition of "compensation" shall include differential wage payments as described in Code Section 3401(h)(2).

Effective July 1, 2000, and each July 1 thereafter, the Board shall increase the amount of each pension benefit payable to a retiree or beneficiary of a retiree who had 5 or more years of credited service at the time of retirement by a pension adjustment amount which shall be the difference between $9,800.00 and the current annual retirement benefit paid to the retiree or beneficiary. For Members subject to section 1:552.1(20)(b), such retirees or beneficiaries of such a retiree must have had 10 or more years of credited service at the time of retirement to be eligible for such a pension adjustment amount. Said $9,800.00 amount, however, shall be reduced by 5% for each year of credited service less than 20 years. For Members of the Retirement System who commence to receive a Retirement Allowance on or after July 1, 2011, said $9,800.00 amount is to be further reduced by the corresponding percentage reduction in the retiree's straight life retirement allowance based upon the retiree's election of an early retirement in accordance with section 1:557(2) and/or a Retirement Allowance Option provided in section 1:559, and/or for the amount of a withdrawal of Accumulated Contributions under section 1:559(2). Said $9,800.00 amount shall be indexed based upon the National Consumer Price Index, each July 1, beginning July 1, 2001, prior to any applicable credited service reduction. This minimum benefit shall not apply to a Traditional Retirement Plan Member who is also a Dual Retirement Plan Member. 
(2)  Pension Adjustments and Supplemental Benefits. Annually, the Board, in consultation with its actuary and upon receipt of the actuarial report for each fiscal year, shall determine whether to grant a permanent pension benefit adjustment or pay a 1-time supplemental benefit based upon the amount, if any, of funds from the pension adjustment account which may be distributed to eligible retirees and beneficiaries. The aggregate cost of such benefit adjustment or supplemental benefit distribution shall be funded by a transfer from the pension adjustment account to the pension reserve. There shall be no pension benefit adjustment or supplemental benefit paid unless the amount available in the pension adjustment account is equal to or greater than 1% of the total pension payroll. The term "total pension payroll" as used herein shall mean the total amount of pension benefits paid to retirees and beneficiaries in the prior fiscal year as reflected in the annual actuarial report. Eligibility for participation under this subsection shall be determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) and paid in accordance with either subparagraph (b) or (c) of this subsection. 
(a)  Eligibility. Eligibility for participation in a pension benefit adjustment or a supplemental benefit distribution shall be determined in accordance with the following: 
(i)  A retiree who retires under section 1:556(1) shall be eligible to participate beginning the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of his/her effective date of retirement. A beneficiary of a deceased retiree shall be eligible to participate beginning the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the date the retiree would have otherwise satisfied the eligibility condition herein. 
(ii)  A disability retiree or disability retiree's surviving beneficiary shall be eligible to participate beginning the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the first anniversary of the effective date of disability retirement. 
(iii)  In the case of a survivor beneficiary who is receiving a duty death or non- duty death pension benefit, said beneficiary shall be eligible to participate beginning the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year containing the first anniversary of the effective date of the duty death or non-duty death pension benefit payable to said beneficiary. 
(b)  Benefit Adjustments. Effective July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, the Board may increase the amount of each pension payable to all eligible retirees as defined in section 1:574(2)(a) in accordance with sub item (i) or (ii) below. 
(i)  Each Pension that is to be adjusted may be increased by a uniform percentage of the current retirement allowance, but in no case less than $10.00 a month. No increase shall be granted on any July 1 if the percentage amount of increase is less than 1.0%. 
(ii)  Each Pension that is to be adjusted may be increased by an amount determined in accordance with the point system as provided in section 1:574(3)(c). 
(c)  Supplemental Benefit Distributions. Effective July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, the Board may authorize a 1-time supplemental benefit distribution to eligible retirees. The annual total supplemental distribution amount shall not exceed an amount equal to 1/12 of total pension payroll. Distributions shall be paid in a lump sum and paid in such manner and method as approved by the Board. The distribution of benefits hereunder from the pension adjustment account shall not be considered a permanent increase in the rate of Retirement Allowance to be paid and shall not create a liability for its continuance. 
Supplemental benefit distributions shall be based upon a point system and paid in the following manner: 
(i)  Each retiree receives 1 point for each full year of retirement as of the first day of the fiscal year for the year in which the distribution is to occur; 
(ii)  Each retiree receives 1 point for each full year of service credit for actual service rendered in the employ of the City; 
(iii)  Points are summed for all eligible retirees as of the first day of the fiscal year for the year in which the distribution is to occur; and 
(iv)  The total annual benefit distribution amount as determined by the Board is multiplied by the ratio of a retiree's points to the total points of all retirees (i.e., the sum of (i) and (ii) divided by (iii) multiplied by the total annual distribution amount). 
(v)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no individual distribution to a retiree shall be made if the amount of the distribution is less than $25.00.

(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:576. - Health Benefit Fund. 
    The Health Benefit Fund is the accounting Fund which shall be credited with (i) contributions by the City for the purpose of funding all or a portion of the cost of providing health insurance coverage to eligible Retired Members and other qualified Beneficiaries, and (ii) investment experience allocated to the Health Benefit Fund, and which shall be charged with all, or a portion of, applicable premiums or contract charges for such coverage. Eligibility for coverage and the portion of the premium or contract charge to be paid from the Health Benefit Fund shall be determined in accordance with section 1:577. Except as provided at section 1:576(1), contributions to the Health Benefit Fund by the City, when added to any City contributions for life insurance protection provided by the Retirement System, shall not exceed 25% of the total actual contributions to the Retirement System (other than contributions to Fund past Service) for all years since the Health Benefit Fund has been in effect and shall be reasonable and ascertainable. Amounts allocated to the Health Benefit Fund may only be used for retiree health benefits described in section 1:577 and in the City's Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust, and may not be used for any purpose other than providing such retiree health benefits or until the satisfaction of all liabilities under section 1:577, at which time any amount remaining in the Health Benefit Fund shall be returned to the City. Amounts in the Health Benefit Fund shall be allocated to separate 401(h) subaccounts which shall be established for any key employee (as defined in Code Section 416(i)(I)) of the City, and benefits may be paid only from such key employee's subaccount. The City shall not contribute any amounts to the Health Benefit Fund or a Welfare Benefit Fund (as defined in Code Section 419(e)(1)) with respect to Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(A) for which transferred assets are required to be used as described in section 1:576(1)(c) below. 
(1)  Code Section 420 Transfer of Excess Assets to the Health Benefit Fund. In addition to contributions made directly by the City under section 1:576, the Health Benefit Fund may be funded by a Qualified Transfer of "Excess Assets" of the Retirement System to the Health Benefit Fund. "Excess Assets" means those assets in excess of the Retirement System's (i) full funding limit; or (ii) 125% of the Retirement System's current liability (as described in Code Section 412(c)(7)(B)). The Qualified Transfer of assets does not otherwise count against the limits on City Contributions described in section 1:576 to the Health Benefit Fund. The Qualified Transfer of excess assets is subject to the requirements described below: 
(a)  Limitation on Number of Qualified Transfers Per Taxable Year. No more than 1 transfer of excess assets under this section 1:576(1) during a taxable year of the City; provided that in no event shall any such Qualified Transfer be made after December 31, 2013. 
(b)  Limit on Amount of Transfer. The amount of excess assets transferred from the Retirement System to the Health Benefit Fund shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be paid during the tax year of the transfer for "Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities" as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(A). The amount to be transferred shall be reduced by the ratio of (i) assets (as of June 30 preceding the Plan Year of the transfer) previously set aside to pay for the Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities (as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(B)(i)), to pay for the Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities, to (ii) the present value of the Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities for all Plan Years (as defined in Code Section 420(e)(1)(B)(ii)). In the event the amount transferred exceeds the amount used to pay Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities, the excess (including income thereon) shall be returned from the Health Benefit Fund to the Retirement System. 
(c)  Use of Transferred Assets. Any assets (and any income allocable thereto) of the Retirement System transferred to the Health Benefit Fund shall be used only to pay reasonably estimated Current Retiree Health Liabilities (other than liabilities of key employees not taken into account under Section 420(e)(1)(D)) for the taxable year of the transfer. For purposes of this section, any amount paid out of the Health Benefit Fund shall be treated as first being paid out of excess assets transferred to the Health Benefit Fund pursuant to this section 1:595(1) and income thereon. 
(d)  Accelerated Vesting Requirement. 
(i)  An employee who is a Member in the Retirement System on the date of the transfer shall be 100% vested on the date of the Qualified Transfer in his then currently accrued benefit in the Retirement System, in the same manner as if the Retirement System had terminated immediately before the Qualified Transfer. 
(ii)  A Member who separated from Service at the City during the 1-year period ending on the date of the Qualified Transfer shall be 100% vested in his then currently accrued benefit as if the Retirement System had terminated immediately before his separation from Service. 
A Member who vests in an accrued benefit under this section 1:576(1)(d) shall nonetheless be subject to the vesting requirements of section 1:558, with respect to future benefit accruals in the Retirement System. In the case of a Member who becomes vested pursuant to section 1:576(1)(d)(ii) above, which Member has been paid his Accumulated Member Contributions and has accordingly forfeited his Credited Service, such Member shall have his accrued benefit based upon his previously forfeited Credited Service retroactively reinstated and vested, provided that the vested accrued benefits so reinstated and vested shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of his Accumulated Member Contributions previously paid to him/her. 
(e)  Maintenance of Applicable Retiree Health Care Costs. As more fully set forth in section 1:734(1) of the City's Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust, in the event of a Qualified Transfer after December 17, 1999, the City shall maintain levels of Applicable Employer Retiree Health Costs during the Cost Maintenance Period, as such terms are defined in section 1:734(1) of the City's Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust. 
(f)  Maintenance of Applicable Retiree Health Care Benefits. As is more full set forth in section 1:734(2) of the City Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust, in the event of a Qualified Transfer occurring before December 17, 1999, the City shall maintain levels of Applicable Employer Retiree Health Benefits during the Health Benefits Period, as such terms are defined in section 1:734(2) of the City Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust. 
(g)  Key Employees Excluded. Assets transferred to the Health Benefit Fund cannot be used to pay the retiree health benefits of any Member who was a key employee (within the meaning of Code Section 416(i)(11)) at any time during the Plan Year ending within the tax year of the City in which the Qualified Transfer was made. If an employee is a key employee with respect to any Plan Year, such employee shall not be taken into account in computing Qualified Current Retiree Health Liabilities for such taxable year, or in calculating Applicable Employer Retiree Health Costs during the Cost Maintenance Period as such terms are defined in section 1:734(1) of the City's Retiree Health Care Benefits Plan and Trust. 
(h)  Limitation of City Deductions. The City shall not be entitled to a deduction for (i) amounts transferred to the Health Benefit Fund in a Qualified Transfer (nor for any excess Qualified Transfer funds returned to the Retirement System pursuant to Code Section 420(c)(1)(B)(i)); (ii) for amounts which are used from the Health Benefit Fund to pay Retiree Health Benefits which otherwise would have been deductible in the tax year of the Qualified Transfer had the expenses been paid directly by the City; nor (iii) for any Retiree Health Benefits for the year of the Qualified Transfer that are paid directly by the City, except such expenses which exceed the excess (if any) of the amount of the Qualified Transfer reduced by the amounts paid from the Health Benefit Fund pursuant to subsection (g)(ii) above. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Retirement Ordinance, excess amounts transferred under section 1:576(1)(b), "Limit on Amount of Transfer" shall not exceed state law limitations as set forth in Michigan Compiled Laws Annotation (MCLA) 38.571 which section is incorporated by reference in this Retirement Ordinance.

(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:628. - Direct Rollovers. 
(1)  Direct Rollover Option . Notwithstanding any provision of the Retirement Ordinance to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the distributee as a direct rollover. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  Eligible Rollover Distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: (A) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; (B) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under IRC § 401(a)(9) relating to minimum distribution requirements, (C) any distribution made upon the hardship of the Member or Dual Retirement Plan Member, and (D) the portion of a distribution that is not includible in gross income. 
A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because it consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion may be paid only to (1) an individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC § 408(a) or (b) (a "traditional IRA") or a Roth individual retirement account or annuity described in IRC § 408A (a "Roth IRA"); or (2) to a qualified defined contribution, defined benefit, or annuity plan described in IRC §§ 401(a) or 403(a), or to an annuity contract described in § 403(b), if such plan or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred, (including interest thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(b)  Eligible Retirement Plan. An "eligible retirement plan" means (A) a traditional IRA, (B) a Roth IRA, (C) an annuity plan described in IRC § 403(a), (D) an annuity contract described in IRC § 403(b), (E) an eligible plan under IRC § 457 which is maintained by a state or political subdivision of a state or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Retirement System; or (F) a qualified trust described in IRC § 401(a), that accepts eligible rollover distributions. 
The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving Spouse, or to a Spouse or former Spouse who is an alternate payee. 
In the case of a distributee who is a non-Spouse designated Beneficiary, (1) the direct rollover may be made only to a traditional or Roth individual retirement account that is established on behalf of the designated non-Spouse Beneficiary for the purpose of receiving the distribution and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provision of Code § 402(c)(11), and (2) the determination of any required minimum distribution required under Code § 401(a)(9) that is ineligible for rollover shall be made in accordance with IRS Notice 2007-7, Q&A 17 and 18. 
If the Member's or Dual Retirement Plan Member's designated Beneficiary is a trust, the Retirement System may make a direct rollover to an IRA on behalf of the trust, provided the trust satisfies the requirements to be a designated Beneficiary. 
(c)  Distributee. A "distributee" includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving Spouse or spouse or former Spouse who is an alternate payee under a domestic relations order is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse or surviving Spouse. The non-Spouse Beneficiary of a Member or former Member or Dual Retirement Plan Member or former Dual Retirement Plan Member also may be a distributee with regard to the interest of the non-Spouse Beneficiary that is directly transferred to a traditional or Roth IRA established on behalf of the non-Spouse designated Beneficiary for the purpose of receiving the distribution. 
(d)  Direct Rollover. A "direct rollover" is a payment by the Retirement System to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(e)  Procedures. The Board may establish procedures for the distribution of eligible rollover distributions, including any limitations on the amount eligible for a rollover distribution, to the extent permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. 16-28, § 1, 1-3-17) 
1:629. - Reversion of Funds to City Prohibited, Exceptions. 
    All assets of the Retirement System shall be held and invested in accordance with the terms of the Traditional Retirement Plan and the Dual Retirement Plan for the sole purpose of meeting the obligations of the Retirement System, including to pay the reasonable expenses of administration of the Retirement System and shall be used for no other purpose. No part of the corpus or income held in trust under the provisions of this chapter shall be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Members, Retirants and Beneficiaries of the Retirement System prior to satisfaction of all Retirement System obligations, except that: 
(a)  If the City determines that any contribution, or any portion thereof, was made by a good faith mistake of fact, then the Board of Trustees shall upon written request of the City return the contribution, or such portion thereof, to the City within 1 year after such determination; however, any earnings attributable to the amounts to be returned shall not be returned to the City, while losses attributable to such amounts shall reduce the amount to be returned; and 
(b)  If, after termination or partial termination of the Retirement System, by formal action of the City or for any other reason, the accrued benefits of all Members, Retirants and other Retirement System Beneficiaries and all other Retirement System liabilities have been paid, then, any residual assets of the Retirement System shall revert to the City. 
(c)  The Board of Trustees and its employees are prohibited from having a beneficial interest, direct or indirect, in an investment of the Retirement System; borrowing from the Retirement System; and receiving any pay or emolument (except the occasional gifts or other considerations, the value of which shall not exceed $50.00 on any 1 occasion, nor exceed $100.00 in value in the aggregate during any 1 Plan Year) from any individual or organization providing services to the Retirement System.

(2)  In the event of the discontinuance, termination or partial termination of the Traditional Retirement Plan or the Dual Retirement Plan, or both, the rights of all Members to benefits accrued to the date of such termination or partial termination, to the extent funded as of such date, or Account balances as of the date of such termination or partial termination, as applicable, shall be vested and nonforfeitable. The discontinuance, termination or partial termination shall be carried out in all respects in conformance with the Code and with applicable statutes, rules or regulations of the State of Michigan, or any duly constituted agency thereof.

The Board shall render a decision on the claim appeal promptly, but not later than 60 days after the receipt of the claimant's request for review, unless special circumstances (such as the need to hold a hearing, if necessary), require an extension of time for processing, in which case the 60 days prior may be extended to 120 days.

    The Plan and Trust taken as a whole shall constitute a "voluntary employees' beneficiary association" (VEBA) under Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and is created for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits through policies issued by duly licensed commercial insurance companies, through a fund of self-insurance, or through any other lawful means of providing group health, and life insurance in accordance with any and all applicable City Personnel Rules and regulations and Collective Bargaining Agreements between the City and applicable Collective Bargaining Associations, for the benefit of the City of Ann Arbor Employees' Retirement System Retirees and beneficiaries who are eligible to participate in accordance with the Plan. The City intends the benefits to be provided by the establishment and maintenance of a trust fund in conformance with all applicable federal statutes and regulations, state, and local law. 
    The City reserves the right to enter into insurance agreements, and to modify, alter or amend such agreements from time to time, with commercial insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations or any other qualified entity currently existing or created for the purpose of providing benefits under the Plan.

Where not governed by Michigan law, this Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the applicable federal laws, and all provisions hereof shall be administered according to such federal laws.

    Neither the establishment of the Plan nor the Trust nor any modification thereof, nor the creation of any fund or account, nor the payment of any benefits, shall be construed as giving to any person covered under the Plan and Trust or other person any legal or equitable right against the City, its elected or appointed official or employees, the Trustees or any individual Trustee, except as may otherwise be provided in this chapter.

1:718. - Commencement of benefit. 
    Subject to all applicable provisions of the Plan and/or insurance agreement, a participant shall commence eligibility for benefits from the Plan on the first day he or she satisfies the eligibility requirements of section 1:717, provided the participant has enrolled for coverage on such date. 
(Ord. No. 41-98, § 1, 10-19-98)

(1)  The City shall give each Participant timely written notice of his or her eligibility and his or her right to enroll for coverage under the Plan. A Participant or Retiree may enroll for coverage on a form or forms provided by and filed with the City. In connection with his or her enrollment for coverage, the Participant or Retiree shall furnish all pertinent information requested by the City, Plan Administrator and/or the Insurance Carrier, including but not limited to the names, relationships and birth dates of the participant's or Retiree's Spouse and eligible Dependents, and any pertinent Medicare Part A and B information of any Participant, Retiree, Spouse and/or eligible Dependent, and the Plan Administrator or the Insurance Carrier may rely upon all such forms and information furnished.

1:720. - Termination of benefits.

1:721. - COBRA continuation coverage. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1:720, continuing coverage shall be provided under the Plan to Participants, Retirees, their Spouses and Dependents in accordance with Internal Revenue Code provisions (currently Section 4980B, and Title XXII of the Public Health Services Act ("COBRA continuation coverage"), as amended). The terms of such COBRA continuation coverage are described below: 
(1)  COBRA continuation coverage shall be offered under the following circumstances ("qualifying events") if participation under the Plan ordinarily would terminate as a result of such circumstances: 
(a)  The Participant's or Retiree's divorce or legal separation; 
(b)  Death of the Participant, Retiree, Spouse, or Dependent; 
(c)  A Dependent child, ceasing to qualify as a "Dependent" eligible for coverage under the terms of the Plan;

(f)  Entitlement is specified in an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or City personnel rules and regulations. 
(2)  COBRA continuation coverage shall be offered only to the Participant or Retiree and/or his or her Spouse and his or her Dependents who were covered under the Plan on the day before the qualifying event occurred and who loses coverage under the Plan on account of the qualifying event ("qualified beneficiaries"). The qualified beneficiary shall be entitled to elect only the type of coverage that he or she was receiving under the Plan at the time of the qualifying event. The qualified beneficiary may elect to change his or her type of coverage during an open enrollment period. Such an election does not alter in any way the Participant's or Retiree's entitlement for, or the terms of, COBRA continuation coverage. 
(3)  In the case of qualifying events described in subsection (1)(a) or (c) above, the Retiree or his or her family must notify the City of the qualifying event within 60 days of the date of the event. In all other cases, the City shall be deemed to be notified of the qualifying event. Within 14 days of such notification, the City shall provide the Retiree and/or his or her family with a notice of the right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Any such notification to an individual who is a qualified beneficiary as a Spouse of a Retiree shall be treated as notification to all other qualified beneficiaries residing with such Spouse at the time such notification is made. 
(4)  The Participant, his or her Spouse, or his or her Dependent may elect COBRA continuation coverage within 60 days after the later of the date of the qualifying event, or the date of the notice from the City to the qualified beneficiary. Each qualified beneficiary may make a separate election for COBRA continuation coverage. If an election is made within the 60-day period, the Plan shall permit payment for COBRA continuation coverage during the period preceding such election to be made not less than 45 days after the date of the election. If the election to continue coverage is not made within the above 60-day period, then no further opportunity to continue shall be extended to the Retiree, his or her Spouse or his or her Dependents. 
(5)  In the case of subsection (1)(a) through (d), COBRA continuation coverage may continue for up to 36 months. In the case of subsection (1)(e), coverage may continue: 
(a)  Until the death of the Retiree or of any qualified beneficiary who, on the day before the qualifying event, was a surviving Spouse of the Retiree covered under the Plan; or 
(b)  In the case of a surviving Spouse or Dependent child of the Retiree, for up to 36 months after the death of the Retiree. Notwithstanding the continuation periods specified above, COBRA continuation coverage shall be modified as follows: 
1.  COBRA continuation coverage shall terminate with respect to a qualified beneficiary upon the earlier of: 
(A)  The date on which the City ceases to provide any group health Plan to any employee; 
(B)  The date upon which coverage under the Plan ceases as a result of failure to make timely premium payments as required by section 1:721(6); premium payments shall be considered timely if made within 30 days of the due date; however, coverage shall be terminated retroactively as of the date if payments are not received within 30 days; non-sufficient fund checks are not payment; 
(C)  The date upon which the qualified beneficiary becomes covered under any other group health Plan (as an employee or otherwise) if such Plan does not contain an exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of such qualified beneficiary; or 
(D)  The date upon which the qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits. 
2.  COBRA continuation coverage shall be continued for a period of 36 months in the event of multiple qualifying events. 
(6)  The Plan shall require payment of a premium for any period of COBRA continuation coverage in an amount that shall not exceed 102% of the cost to the Plan for such period of coverage for Retirees, Spouses or Dependents receiving benefits under the Plan with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred. The cost to the Plan for coverage shall be determined for a period of 12 months selected by the Plan and shall be determined before the beginning of such period. The qualified beneficiary may elect to make any required premium payments in monthly installments. 
(7)  COBRA continuation coverage is not conditioned upon evidence of insurability. 
(8)  If there is a conflict between this section and the Internal Revenue Code provisions (currently Section 4980B, and Title XXII of the Public Health Services Act ("COBRA continuation coverage"), as amended), the Internal Revenue Code provisions prevail. 
(Ord. No. 41-98, § 1, 10-19-98) 
1:722. - Conversion privilege. 
    An individual who is no longer eligible to receive benefits under the Plan (as a Spouse, Dependent or COBRA qualified beneficiary) may, if permitted by and in accordance with the terms of the Plan and/or insurance agreement, convert his or her coverage under the Plan to an individual medical expense policy with the Plan administrator and/or the insurance carrier, without the necessity of a medical examination and with no interruption in coverage. The cost of such individual conversion coverage shall be paid solely by the affected individual. Application for individual conversion coverage must be made to the City and/or Plan Administrator in accordance with the Plan and/or to the insurance carrier in accordance with the insurance agreement. A COBRA qualified beneficiary must be given notification of this conversion privilege during the 180-day period ending on the expiration of the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation period.

All Subsidized Retirees, and/or eligible Dependents who were in receipt of retiree health care benefits at the time of enactment of this Plan and Trust shall continue to be eligible for the same benefits. 
    In accordance with the Plan and/or insurance agreement with the insurance carrier and subject to sections 1:707 and 1:720, Non-Subsidized Retirees may voluntarily enroll themselves and their eligible Dependents for coverage under this Plan when they first become eligible for retiree coverage pursuant to section 1:717; such enrollment must be accomplished in the manner and by the deadline established by the Plan Administrator and the terms of the Plan. Non-Subsidized Retirees will be solely responsible to pay for their (and their eligible Dependents) premium or contribution cost of coverage under the Plan. The City will not subsidize or pay for a Non-Subsidized Retiree's cost of such voluntarily elected coverage (provided, however, that a Non-Subsidized Retiree could use a retiree health reimbursement account balance, to the extent one is available and as permitted by law, to pay for his/her cost of coverage under the Plan).

1:726. - Medicare eligibility. 
    Unless otherwise stated below, upon attaining the age of Medicare eligibility, all eligible Retirees and/or Spouses shall enroll in both Medicare A and B, and are obligated to pay for Medicare Part B. Once a Retiree is in receipt of Medicare A and B coverage, this Plan will provide complementary coverage as provided pursuant to any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement and/or the coverage in effect at the time of retirement. 
    A Retiree and/or Spouse is obligated to take Medicare Part A if he/she has reached the age of Medicare eligibility and has 40 covered quarters, or if he/she has a Spouse with 40 covered quarters who has reached the age of Medicare eligibility, and can obtain Medicare Part A without any cost to the Retiree or Spouse. In the event a Retiree or Spouse is not eligible for Medicare Part A without any cost to the Retiree or Spouse, and provides proof of same to the Plan Administrator, Retiree or Spouse shall be eligible for continued health care coverage at the same benefit level under the Plan as if the Retiree or Spouse has not attained the age at which Medicare eligibility is determined.

For this reason, the Plan coordinates benefits with other insurance policies according to industry standards and applicable laws.

In addition, the Plan Administrator may reimburse any other Plan, person or entity that has paid an expense on behalf of a Retiree, his or her Spouse or Dependents which expense was payable under this Plan. In such event, the Plan, Plan Administrator and/or the insurance carrier shall be relieved of all further responsibility with respect to that expense. 
(2)  Subrogation. In the event any payment is made by the Trust under the Plan, the Plan and the Trust shall be subrogated and shall succeed to the rights of any Retiree, his or her Spouse and Dependents against any other Plan, person or entity for recovery of health care expenses for which such other Plan, person or entity legally is liable.

Retirees, their Spouses and Dependents shall furnish such information, execute and deliver such assignments, documents or other instruments, and take whatever steps are necessary to secure the rights of the Plan. Retirees, their Spouses and Dependents shall take no action to prejudice the rights and interests of the Plan hereunder.

(Ord. No. 54-75, 12-8-75) 
Chapter 23 - LIVING WAGE REQUIREMENTS IN CITY CONTRACTS AND GRANTS 

1:811. - Purposes. 
    The purposes of this chapter are (1) to increase the quality and reliability of services procured for the city or provided to city inhabitants by contractors, vendors, and grantees by promoting higher productivity and retention of employees working on city contracts and grants; (2) to use city spending to encourage the development of jobs paying wages above the poverty level; (3) to use city spending and procurement of services to require covered employers that provide services to the city or that receive certain other forms of financial assistance from the city for providing services to city inhabitants pay their employees a "living wage," that is, a wage sufficient to meet their employees' basic subsistence needs; (4) to raise the income of low-income working people and their families employed by covered employers on city contracts or grants; (5) to permit hardship exemptions for certain non-profit employers from the provisions of this chapter; (6) to provide incentives for covered employers to provide health insurance to their employees; (7) to monitor and enforce the requirements of this chapter; and (8) for other purposes. 
(Ord. No. 9-01, § 1, 3-5-01) 
1:812. - Findings. 
    The City Council finds as follows: 
(1)  According to economic research summarized in the Economic Policy Institute's August 2000 issue guide, "Higher Wages Lead to More Efficient Service Provision," payment of higher wages is associated with greater business investment in employee training, higher productivity, and lower employee turnover, and this chapter is intended to promote better quality and reliability of services procured for the city or provided to city inhabitants by contractor/vendors and grantees by promoting higher productivity and retention of employees working on city contracts and grants; 
(2)  This chapter is adopted pursuant to the city's spending and procurement powers as set forth in the City Charter and provided under Article 7 of the 1963 Constitution and provides for payment of living wages only to employees of covered employers; further, this chapter does not establish any generally applicable city minimum wage, or affect the wages paid by any business or individual that chooses not to provide services covered by this chapter to the city, or not to accept city grants falling within this chapter's coverage. 
(3)  The Michigan League for Human Services found in its October 1998 report, "Economic Self-Sufficiency: A Michigan Benchmark," that a family of 3 required at that time, on average, $2,724.00 a month to pay for housing, food, child care, health care, transportation, clothing, household supplies, a telephone, and taxes, and this was at the time equivalent to an hourly wage of $15.83 for households with a single worker and $7.92 for households with 2 workers; 
(4)  The Michigan County Social Services Association found in its 2000 "market basket survey" that a "minimal needs" budget for a family of 3 in Michigan required $15,222.00 per year (not including anything for health care benefit costs and assuming rent of only $465.00 a month). According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Ann Arbor Metropolitan Statistical Area for 2000 was $717.00 a month, and the fair market rent for a 3-bedroom apartment was $940.00 a month. This means that a family of 3 requires at least $18,246.00 a year to meet a minimal needs budget in the Ann Arbor area, not including health care. This converts to an hourly wage of $8.77 for a full-time, full-year employee; 
(5)  Federal and state minimum wages, currently set at only $5.15 an hour, mean that a full-time, full-year minimum wage employee earns only $206.00 a week, or $10,712.00 a year, while the 2000 United States Department of Health and Human Services federal poverty guideline was $8,350.00 for a single person, $11,250.00 for a 2-person family, $14,150 a year for a 3-person family, and $17,050.00 a year for a 4-person family; and income near the poverty level is not a desirable standard of living sufficient to meet the subsistence needs of a family in Ann Arbor and its surrounding communities; and 
(6)  Two studies of the effect of the living wage ordinance in Baltimore present evidence that indicates increased employee morale and productivity, and a decrease in employee turnover as a result of the living wage requirements ("Baltimore's Living Wage Law: An Analysis of the Fiscal and Economic Costs of Baltimore City Ordinance 442", Mark Weisbrot and Michelle Sforza-Roderick and "The Effects of the Living Wage in Baltimore", Christoper Niedt, Greg Rutiers, Dana Wise, and Erica Schoenberger).

1:816. - Employees covered. 
    A covered employer shall pay each of its employees performing work on any covered contract or grant with the city no less than a living wage as defined in section 1:815.

1:817. - Exemptions. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions in this chapter, the following exemptions shall apply: 
(1)  Sweat equity contracts for home construction or rehabilitation grant will not subject the grantee to coverage under this chapter.

(a)  To avoid any application of this Chapter that would violate federal, state or local law(s); or 
(b)  The application of this chapter would cause demonstrated economic harm to an otherwise covered employer that is a non-profit organization, and the City Council finds that said harm outweighs the benefits of this chapter; provided further that the otherwise covered non-profit employer shall provide a written plan to fully comply with this chapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 3 years, and the City Council then agrees that granting a partial or complete exemption is necessary to ameliorate the harm and permit the non-profit organization sufficient time to reach full compliance with this chapter. 
(3)  A loan shall be considered a grant under this ordinance only to the extent that a loan is provided at below market interest rates and then only the difference between the amount of the loan and the present value of the payments thereunder, discounted over the life of the loan, shall be treated as financial assistance under this ordinance.

2:22c. - Water capital recovery charges for fire service. 
    The water capital recovery charge for a fire service connection is calculated as 35.5% of the amounts calculated and provided for in subsections 2:22b(1) through (3), based on the meter size equivalent to the fire line pipe size. Sewer charges are not required for a fire service connection to the city water supply system. 
(1)  Water capital recovery charges for a fire service connection are calculated as follows: 
Fire Line Tap Size 
(inches) 35.5% of Capacity Generating Assets Charge 35.5% of Non-Capacity Generating Assets Charge Total Fire Service Water Capital Recovery Charge 0.75 $3,289.00 $78.00 $3,367.00 1.00 $3,289.00 $78.00 $3,367.00 1.50 $8,074.00 $78.00 $8,152.00 2.00 $13,158.00 $78.00 $13,236.00 2.50 $29,905.00 $78.00 $29,983.00 3.00 $44,857.00 $78.00 $44,935.00 4.00 $74,762.00 $78.00 $74,840.00 6.00 $167,468.00 $78.00 $167,546.00 8.00 $218,306.00 $78.00 $218,384.00 10.00 $349,888.00 $78.00 $349,966.00 12.00 $526,327.00 $78.00 $526,405.00  
(2)  For a fire service connection the capacity generating assets charge component is reduced by a credit of 51% before the 35.5% calculation is applied for the following category of properties: 
A.  A parcel that is part of a development project for which the owner or developer constructed and dedicated to the city pursuant to an agreement with the city, an addition or enhancement to that portion of the city water supply system that serves the development and to which the parcel connects. 
Water capital recovery charges for fire connections with the credit applied to reduce the capacity generating assets charge component and with the 35.5% calculation applied are calculated as follows: 
Fire Line Tap Size 
(inches) 35.5% of Capacity Generating Assets Charge with Credit 35.5% of Non-Capacity Generating Assets Charge Total Fire Service Water Capital Recovery Charge with Credit 0.75 $1,612.00 $78.00 $1,690.00 1.00 $1,612.00 $78.00 $1,690.00 1.50 $3,956.00 $78.00 $4,034.00 2.00 $6,447.00 $78.00 $6,525.00 2.50 $14,653.00 $78.00 $14,731.00 3.00 $21,980.00 $78.00 $22,058.00 4.00 $36,633.00 $78.00 $36,711.00 6.00 $82,059.00 $78.00 $82,137.00 8.00 $106,970.00 $78.00 $107,048.00 10.00 $171,445.00 $78.00 $171,523.00 12.00 $257,900.00 $78.00 $257,978.00  
When a property increases the size of an existing fire service connection to the city water supply system or replaces an existing fire service connection with a larger fire service connection, defined by the tap sizes, the water capital recovery charge for that larger or new fire service connection shall be the difference between the charge shown above for the existing fire line tap size and the charge shown above for the new fire line tap size. Credit will be provided only when a fire service connection increases the size of or replaces an existing fire service connection. Credit will not be provided when a fire service connection replaces a water connection that is not a fire service connection. When a property decreases the size of an existing fire service connection to the city water supply system or replaces an existing fire service connection with a smaller fire service connection, defined by the tap sizes, the city will not refund any prior improvement or connection charge. 
(3)  The water capital recovery charge for a fire service connection for a property newly connecting directly or indirectly to a water main first constructed by the city after December 31, 2014, shall also include 35.5% of the extension charge component provided for in subsection 2:22b(3), which will be uniform.

(3)  The capacity generating assets charge component is reduced by a credit of 11% for the following categories of properties: 
A.  A parcel that is part of a development project for which the owner or developer constructed and dedicated to the city, pursuant to an agreement with the city, an addition or enhancement to that portion of the city sanitary sewer system that serves the development and to which the parcel connects. 
B.  A parcel that was part of the city before 2004, or whose parent parcel was part of the city before 2004, and connects to an existing sanitary sewer main built before 2004. 
C.  A parcel that connects to a sanitary sewer main first constructed by the city after December 31, 2014. Parcels in this category also will pay an extension charge component as provided in subsection (4). 
Sanitary sewer capital recovery charges with the credit applied to reduce the capacity generating assets charge component are calculated as follows:

(5)  If a property connects to the city sanitary sewer supply system for fire service on or after July 1, 2015, and before April 1, 2016, and has paid or been assessed water main improvement charges and/or connection charges at the time of that connection, the property owner shall be entitled to a refund of the difference between the sum of those charges and the applicable sanitary sewer capital recovery charge calculated in accordance with this section if it is less. Provided, that if the property also connected to the city water supply system for domestic service and/or to the city water supply system for fire service on or after July 1, 2015, and before April 1, 2016, the property owner must make the same choice of charges under this subsection 2:42.4(5) for the connection to the city sanitary system, under subsection 2:22b(4) for the connection to the city water supply system for domestic service, and under subsection 2:22c(4) for the connection to the city water supply system for fire service. If the property owner is paying installments, the installment payments will be adjusted accordingly. 
(6)  The city shall not furnish sanitary sewer collection or wastewater treatment services to consumers outside city limits, except pursuant to agreements approved by the city council. Such agreements may hereafter be approved in the following circumstances: 
A.  Where necessary to obtain a right-of-way; 
B.  For governmental entities; 
C.  To eliminate a health hazard on an existing developed premises which cannot be annexed to the city because it is not currently contiguous to the city and where the customer agrees as a condition of receiving city sanitary sewer collection and wastewater treatment services to annex when possible; or 
D.  Where the customer agrees, as a condition of receiving city sanitary sewer collection and wastewater treatment services, (a) to petition for and complete annexation when possible, or (b) agrees to petition for and complete annexation by a specified date, to pursue annexation with due diligence and, starting on the date specified in the agreement for when the petition for annexation must be completed, to pay the city a sum equal to the city tax rate as applied to the existing taxable value of the premises, due and payable on July 31 of each year until real property tax payments are due by addition to the city tax roll. 
Such agreements shall require: 
A.  Sewer rates of not less than 2 times the rate for service in the city, provided that for governmental institutions the rate may be less than 2 times the city rate, but more than the city rate; 
B.  Payment by the customer of the sanitary sewer capital recovery charges specified in section 2:42.4 of this chapter; and 
C.  That the capital recovery charges in subsection (2) shall be due and payable at the time of connection to the sanitary sewer system, that said capital recovery charges shall constitute a lien upon the property serviced, shall be a charge against the owner or owners of the serviced property until paid, and that said lien and charges shall include accrued interest and penalties. 
D.  City Council may permit the payment of said sanitary sewer capital recovery charges in installments as provided in section 1:275 of Chapter 12. 
Upon annexation of the serviced property to the city, the lien upon the serviced property shall become a lien of the same character and effect as the lien created for city taxes and shall include accrued interest and penalties. Upon annexation, the balance still due under the agreement shall become a single lot assessment against the parcel as of the date of annexation and payments shall be made or continue to be made as provided for in the agreement for payments prior to annexation. 
(7)  Upon annexation, collection of payments, including interest and penalties, shall be in accordance with subsections 1:295(2) and 1:299(2) of Chapter 13. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 49-03, § 4, 1-5-04; Ord. No. 33-04, § 1, 9-7-04; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05; Ord. No. 08-36, § 2, 11-6-08; Ord. No. 16-03, § 4, 3-21-16) 
2:42.5. - Capacity required for connection. 
(1)  No connection to the POTW shall be allowed unless there is sufficient available hydraulic and treatment capacity in the POTW for the additional wastewater from the proposed connection. 
(2)  All developments within the city requiring any form of site plan approval, and/or projects requiring an application for a Part 41 Permit from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, or a successor agency, are required to offset-mitigate estimated new sewage flows. However, if all the new sanitary system connections for the properties covered by a site plan or by a Part 41 Permit collectively add flow less than the average daily flow from a duplex residential unit, the properties shall be exempt from offset-mitigation requirements. 
(3)  The Public Services Area Administrator or designee shall be the Developer Offset Mitigation Program Manager, and the Public Services Area Administrator is authorized to develop developer offset mitigation guidelines to address and govern implementation details such as procedures, flow measurements, and flow mitigation measurements and requirements. 
(4)  Properties requiring site plan approval must disconnect any existing on-site footing drains from the sanitary sewer. 
(5)  A facility developed by a county, public schools, colleges, universities and other government on property it owns and that is located within the city also must mitigate new sanitary flows to the same extent and in the same manner as a development requiring site plan approval. 
(6)  Calculations showing the proposed sanitary sewer flow being added by the proposed development shall be included on the utility sheet of the site plan and/or construction plan, as applicable, and be reviewed by the Developer Offset Mitigation Program Manager. Calculations and the design dry weather flow rates shall be in accordance with the city's developer offset mitigation guidelines. 
(7)  Flow mitigation performed after January 1, 2015, and verified and documented by the city, but not assigned to a particular development, may be credited to a specific development without being subject to expiration unless otherwise approved by the Developer Offset Mitigation Program Manager. 
(8)  Method of flow mitigation alternative shall be submitted for review and approval by the Developer Offset Mitigation Program Manager. Common forms of mitigation will be listed in the city's Developer Offset Mitigation Guidelines and may include, but will not be limited to: 
(a)  Building removal; 
(b)  Footing drain disconnection; 
(c)  Plumbing fixture retrofits; 
(d)  Pool filter backwash retrofits; 
(e)  Sanitary sewer system inflow or infiltration removal. 
(9)  A development has the option to make a payment to the city in lieu of performing sanitary flow mitigation. Payment will be used by the city to fund sanitary sewer wet weather capacity improvement projects. 
(a)  The payment amount will be per a gallon per minute of new peak sanitary flow being added to the system, will be established by City Council, and may be revised by City Council. 
(b)  For developments subject to site plan approval, payment must be received prior to the city's issuance of any certificate of occupancy. 
(c)  For governmental facilities subject to this section, payment must be received by the city prior to the set of the first water meter. 
(10)  If a township contributes sanitary flow into the city's sanitary sewer system at a point where adequate transport capacity within the city has not been purchased and/or constructed by the township, the township must adopt an ordinance or approve and implement a policy equivalent to the offset-mitigation requirements of this section 2:42.5 to apply to developments and sanitary sewer connections within the areas that contribute that flow. If the mitigation takes place within the city, city staff will verify the mitigation work, but will not provide compliance tracking. The township will be responsible for coordinating a compliance tracking and reporting procedure acceptable to the city to document that the mitigation work was completed. 
(11)  New sanitary sewer system connections for single- or 2-family homes currently using on-site sewage disposal systems shall be exempt from offset-mitigation requirements. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 16-13, § 1, 7-7-16) 
2:42.6. - Annexing properties; disconnection of footing drains from sanitary sewer.

* Grab samples shall be used for total cyanide and fats, oil and grease. At the Administrator's discretion, these limits may be applied to single grab samples or to multiple grab samples collected over a 24-hour period and composited in the field or in the laboratory prior to analysis. 
** NQ indicates non-quantifiable, which means below the level of quantification (LOQ). Unless specified otherwise by the Administrator, the LOQ shall be 0.0002 mg/l which corresponds to testing with U.S. EPA Method 245.1. This LOQ may be adjusted by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis where there is laboratory-demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where deemed necessary to meet requirements of the city's Mercury Pollutant Minimization Program, the Administrator may specify a limit lower than the LOQ of 0.0002 mg/l and require low-level mercury testing with U.S. EPA Method 1631. Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring shall correspond to the required EPA test method. 
Discharge of mercury above the LOQ of 0.0002 mg/l is prohibited, except as specifically approved and permitted by the Administrator subject to the following conditions: 
(i)  The discharger shall have a city-accessible point for monitoring the net nondomestic effluent. All costs for installation of this monitoring point shall be the discharger's responsibility. 
(ii)  The discharger shall routinely self-monitor its effluent for mercury using a representative sample collected over the period of normal discharge, tests conducted in accordance with the U.S. EPA method required by the administrator, and at a frequency required by the Administrator. While the discharger may contract with the city or an outside consultant/laboratory to conduct this sampling and analytical testing, all associated costs shall be the discharger's responsibility. 
(iii)  At its discretion, the city may collect additional samples from the discharger. If the discharger uses an outside consultant/laboratory to perform the self-monitoring, the city will perform a surveillance sampling at least annually. If the city is contracted to perform the self-monitoring, this annual surveillance requirement will be waived. 
(iv)  The discharger shall develop and implement a pollutant minimization program (PMP) to establish actions and schedule commitments for reducing mercury entering the collection system. A PMP plan, which the discharger shall submit to the Administrator for review and concurrence, shall address the following at a minimum: treatment system for removal of mercury from the discharged wastewater; written procedures for disposal of mercury-contaminated wastes; new employee training and refresher training for current employees; review, and elimination where feasible, of purchased materials containing mercury; and other activities deemed appropriate by the discharger or the Administrator. 
Failure to comply with all above conditions may result in revocation of the approval to discharge mercury above the LOQ of 0.0002 mg/l and subject the user to escalated enforcement response including fines, legal action, and termination of sewer services. 
(2)  Trucked wastes. No wastes or wastewater shall be discharged by any user or person into the POTW from a vehicle which transported the waste or wastewater to the point of discharge, unless the discharge is approved in writing prior to the discharge by the Administrator. No wastes or wastewater shall be discharged by any user if the waste or wastewater was at any time transported by a vehicle (such as a tank truck) from its point of generation prior to discharge to the POTW, unless the discharge is approved in writing prior to the discharge by the Administrator. The Administrator shall specify which location must be used and any other terms and conditions for the discharges, including a requirement for a use permit. 
(3)  Categorical pretreatment standards. A user shall comply with all categorical pretreatment standards and any other pretreatment requirements established under 307(b), 307(c), or 402(b)(8) of the Act that are applicable to that user. If a categorical pretreatment standard and another limit contained in this chapter or in an applicable State of Michigan pretreatment requirement regulate the same pollutant, then the more restrictive of them shall apply. 
(4)  Future conditions. Future conditions imposed on the city by government agencies with proper jurisdiction may require subsequent amendment of this chapter by the city. Where federal or state law or regulations require limits on parameters not covered in this chapter or an effective use permit or limits more stringent than those specified in this chapter or an effective use permit, the state or federal limits shall have precedence and take effect with respect to the applicable user on the later of: (i) the effective date of the federal or state limit, or (ii) the date specified for compliance with the limit. 
(5)  Slug discharge. 
(a)  The Administrator may, by written notice to a user, require that the user prepare and implement a slug control plan. The plan shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval as specified in the written notice. The plan shall contain at least the following: 
(i)  A description of discharge practices including non-routine batch discharges; 
(ii)  A description of stored materials; 
(iii)  Procedures for immediately notifying the Administrator of slug discharges, including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under 40 CFR 403.5(b), with procedures for follow-up written notification within 5 days; 
(iv)  Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(b)  Each new major user, within 1 year of being designated as such, will be evaluated by the Administrator for the need for a slug control plan. The Administrator will reevaluate, at least once every 2 years, existing major users which are not required to have a slug control plan. 
(6)  Special agreements. 
(a)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a special agreement between the city and any user, which may be in the form of a use permit, whereby wastewater otherwise prohibited by this section is accepted into the POTW and other special arrangements are made between the city and any user. The special arrangements may include, but are not limited to, pollutant concentration discharge limitations different than those provided in this section. The city shall consider the treatment capacity and treatment capabilities of the POTW in developing discharge limitations for a special agreement. Pollutant concentration discharge limits shall not violate limits specified in federal categorical pretreatment standards. The city shall not be obligated to enter into a special agreement but may do so in its sole discretion. A special agreement shall not create any vested rights or property rights for the user. A special agreement shall not create rights to discharge to the POTW which the user would not have in the absence of a special agreement. The special agreement may be terminated or modified at will by the city. Provisions relating to termination or modification of a special agreement may be more fully set forth in the special agreement. As a condition to the issuance of or entry into a special agreement, the city shall require the user to sign an acknowledgement and acceptance of the provisions of this subsection. The agreement or arrangement may contain provisions for the user to pay a surcharge to the city. A violation of the terms of any special agreement shall be a violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Special alternative limits. For a user discharge that would otherwise be prohibited by section 2:43.1(1)(w), the Administrator may grant a SAL for any pollutant regulated therein as a condition of a use permit or order. All SALs shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(i)  SALs shall only be assigned in accordance with specific procedures established by the Administrator and approved by the MDEQ; 
(ii)  The combined mass of a pollutant allocated to domestic users and nondomestic sources including permitted users, trucked wastes, and all SALs, shall not exceed the corresponding maximum allowable headworks loading ("MAHL") as established by the most recent MDEQ-approved headworks loading study; 
(iii)  The combined mass of a pollutant allocated to nondomestic sources including permitted users, trucked wastes, and all SALs, shall not exceed the corresponding maximum allowable industrial loading ("MAIL") as established by the most recent MDEQ-approved headworks loading study; and 
(iv)  The pollutant concentration of a SAL shall not exceed the corresponding collection system limitation ("CSL"), where applicable, as established by the most recent MDEQ-approved headworks loading study. 
(c)  Local initiative limits. The Administrator may, in a use permit or order, impose a local initiative limit ("LIL") for any pollutant not specifically regulated in section 2:43.1(1)(w). Determination of a LIL concentration or value will consider the acceptable discharge level of said pollutant based on current discharges form other users, current influent loading, treatment plant design, treatability considerations, potential for pass-through or interference, potential for fire/explosion or fume toxicity, potential for adverse impact to the collection system, and other factors as deemed relevant by the Administrator. Any LIL may be subject to MDEQ review and concurrence before implementation. 
(7)  Reserved right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(8)  Best management practices. The Administrator may require a user to implement BMPs or other pollution control activities to ensure compliance with pollutant prohibitions and limitations. Such BMPs or other pollution control activities shall be considered enforceable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(9)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. 
(a)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Administrator, they are necessary for protecting the public sewer against wastewaters containing fats, oils, greases, sand, or similar materials in excessive amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. 
(b)  All grease, oil and sand interceptors shall comply with the following general requirements: 
(i)  Be of a design, type, and capacity approvable by the Administrator. 
(ii)  Located so as to be readily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(iii)  Maintained in continuously efficient operation at all times by the owner of the building or premises from which such wastewaters emanate, or his authorized representative, at the expense of the owner. 
(c)  Food service establishments. Special FSE discharge permits may be issued when, in the opinion of the Administrator, it is necessary to prevent adverse effects on the public sewer. All permitted FSEs shall install, operate, and maintain an outdoor grease interceptor, unless the Administrator determines that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible and authorizes the installation of an alternate grease control technology. The FSE bears the burden of demonstrating to the Administrator's satisfaction that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. A special FSE permit may, at the Administrator's discretion, include user-specific conditions such as interceptor inspection and pump-put frequencies that are more or less stringent than specified herein. Requirements for permitted FSEs shall be as follows: 
(i)  Any user which is already discharging to the POTW upon adoption of this provision and is issued a special FSE discharge permit will be notified in writing by the Administrator of their obligation to install an outside grease interceptor within a period of time specified by the Administrator, or demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. 
(ii)  Any user which is initiating discharge to the POTW after adoption of this provision and which the Administrator determines will be issued a special FSE discharge permit shall submit the design for an outdoor grease interceptor to the Administrator for approval prior to installation, or demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible.

E.  Shall not be connected to any sanitary drainage lines or services without specific authorization from the Administrator. 
F.  Shall have installation inspected and deemed acceptable by the Administrator before placing into service. 
G.  Shall be kept free of inorganic solid materials such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could reduce the effective volume for grease and sludge accumulation. 
H.  Shall be inspected at least once per month by the owner or his authorized representative, or more often if dictated by site-specific conditions. Pump-out of accumulated grease, water, and sludge shall occur quarterly at a minimum, or more often if the combined height of floatables and settled solids exceed 25% of any interceptor compartment operating depth. Water, grease, and sludge removed during pump-out shall not be reintroduced into any portion of the building's sewer or any other drainage leading to the POTW. Interceptor pump-out shall be performed only by a licensed contractor, and the Administrator shall be notified prior to each interceptor pump-out so the operation can be witnessed if desired. 
I.  Shall have a written record of inspections, pumps-outs, and maintenance for a minimum of 3 years. Such records shall be available for review by the Administrator during all operating hours of the establishment. 
(iv)  Alternate grease control technology shall be defined as a device to trap, separate, and hold grease from wastewater and prevent it from being discharged to the POTW.

2:43.2. - Dilution. 
    No discharger shall increase the use of water in any way, where one of the purposes of the increase is for diluting the discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment before discharge to the POTW to achieve compliance with the requirements set forth in this chapter, except upon prior written approval from the Administrator which approval shall be in the sole discretion of the Administrator and must be consistent with federal and state law. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05) 
2:43.3. - Inspections. 
(1)  Authority of inspectors. Authorized representatives of the city exhibiting proper credentials and identification shall be permitted at all reasonable times to enter all user's properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing in connection with the administration of and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(2)  Safety rules of user. While on the property of the user, the authorized representatives of the city shall observe all reasonable safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user. 
(3)  Other inspection. Inspection by state or federal representatives pursuant to law shall not relieve a user from inspection by city representatives, and inspection by the city representatives shall not relieve any user from compliance with lawful inspection by state and federal representatives. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94) 
2:43.4. - Wastewater sampling and analyses. 
(1)  The prohibitions and restrictions in section 2:43.1, or as set forth in a special agreement (which may be a use permit), shall apply at the point where wastewater and pollutants are discharged or caused to be discharged into the POTW and required pretreatment shall be effected before that point is reached. 
(2)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of the discharge shall be determined in accordance with U.S. EPA approved procedures contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 or, in cases where the U.S. EPA approved procedures are not available or do not apply to a particular characteristic, by alternate methods validated by a recognized authority and approved by the Administrator. 
(3)  Grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional sampling techniques, unless the Administrator authorizes an alternative sampling technique such as 24-hour composite samples obtained through time-based sampling techniques or compositing of multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period. Where an alternative sampling technique is authorized by the Administrator, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Justification for an alternative sampling technique shall be provided by the user and documented in the POTW's file for that user. Multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: in the field or in the laboratory for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides; in the laboratory for oil and grease and volatile organics; as authorized by the Administrator for other parameters. 
(4)  For users subject to a FCPS, sampling required for baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports shall use a minimum of 4 grab samples for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds, as applicable, where historical sampling data do not exist. Where historical sampling data do exist, the Administrator may establish an alternative minimum number of grab samples. For other reports required by this chapter, the number of required grab samples shall be as established by the Administrator. 
(5)  If a user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required using procedures contained in this section, such results shall be reported to the Administrator. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05; Ord. No. 18-26, § 1, 9-17-18) 
2:43.5. - Major user sampling and analyses. 
    Unless otherwise modified by a use permit, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Subject to events beyond the control of the major user, major users shall sample or cause to be sampled their discharge by composite flow proportioned sampling. Dilution is prohibited (see section 2:43.2). The major user shall submit a written description of the specific sampling method, sampling equipment, sampling frequency and sampling location to the Administrator and obtain the approval of the Administrator. For users with a new source, this approval shall be obtained prior to commencement of the discharge. major users discharging as of the effective date of this section shall obtain the approval within 90 days of that effective date. 
(2)  Major users may request to not perform self-monitoring, and upon approval by the city, the city will obtain samples using composite flow proportioned sampling or will contract with an independent firm for the sampling. Dilution is prohibited (see section 2:43.2). The major user shall pay a sampling fee to the city to fully reimburse the city for the sampling, including administrative and overhead costs. If the city contracts with an independent firm for the sampling, the major user shall pay the city for amounts paid or to be paid by the city to the independent firm plus any related administrative and overhead costs. 
(3)  Samples shall be analyzed at the sole cost of the major user. If a major user does its own sampling or causes its samples to be taken, then the user shall submit the samples to a laboratory (which may be the major user's own laboratory) approved by the city for analysis. If the major user uses its own laboratory, that major user shall send a split sample to an independent laboratory at least quarterly as a quality control check. If a major user does its own sampling and/or analysis, the city may also take and have analyzed up to 4 daily composites or up to 4 grabs per day for up to 4 days at the sole cost of the major user in any calendar month. if the city takes the samples, the city, in its sole discretion, may analyze the samples in its own laboratory or contract with an independent laboratory for the analysis. 
(4)  The date when a sample is taken, start time, stop time, sample location, sampler programming information, and persons involved in the sampling shall be recorded by the major user if the major user is self-monitoring. 
(5)  Flow measurements shall be taken to determine the daily discharge volume in a manner and with equipment approved by the Administrator. 
(6)  All analytical results shall be submitted to the city by the 15th day following the completion of the reporting frequency if the major user does self-monitoring. Upon request of the major user, the city shall provide copies of analytical results to the major user if the city performs the monitoring. 
(7)  The city shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by a major user if the city requests a split sample. A major user shall be provided with splits of any sample taken by the city if the major user requests a split sample prior to the time the sample is taken. Split samples shall be provided at the time the sample is taken, if possible. 
(8)  A major user (who is performing self monitoring) or the Administrator (if the major user is not performing self monitoring) shall contract with an independent company to maintain; repair, and calibrate the sampling and flow measurement equipment and instruments used to monitor that major user the maintenance, repair, and calibration shall be performed as necessary so that monitoring data is accurate and representative, but in no event less frequently than twice in a calendar year at reasonable intervals. The Administrator, in any event, may inspect and test a major user's flow meters at reasonable times. The city may exempt a major user from some or all of the requirements of this paragraph if the major user demonstrates that accurate and representative monitoring data is being collected. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05) 
2:43.6. - Sampling and analyses by other users. 
    The Administrator may require any other user to install a suitable control structure and necessary measuring and sampling devices to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the quantity, composition, and concentrations of discharges to the POTW. The structure and devices shall be constructed and installed at the user's expense in accordance with plans submitted to the Administrator, and shall be maintained by the user to (a) be safe and accessible during all reasonable time; and (b) provide accurate and representative monitoring data. If the user fails to install the required structures or devices, or maintain them, the city may do so at the expense of the user. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05) 
2:43.7. - Removal of samples and data. 
    The city shall have the right to take and remove samples of wastewater and pollutants discharged into the POTW and make copies of other data and materials concerning the same inspected during an entry upon the user's property. If the city requests that the user make photocopies of documents, the city shall give the user at least 24 hours notice to make copies for the city, but this notice requirement does not affect the rights of the city to immediately copy data or other materials. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94) 
2:43.8. - Authority to require submission of samples. 
    The Administrator may require any user to submit 1 or more representative samples of the wastewater discharged or which it proposes to discharge into the POTW. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05) 
2:43.9. - Failure to permit access or removal of samples and other data. 
    In the event a user refuses to permit access to an authorized city representative or permit the representative to obtain, take, and remove samples and make copies of other data pursuant to this section, the city may take any or all of the following actions: 
(1)  Order the termination of the discharge of wastewater to the POTW. 
(2)  Order the user to permit access within a time certain. 
(3)  Issue a citation or notice or order for a violation of this regulation.

2:44.1. - New installation of pretreatment facilities. 
(1)  Notices. The user or its authorized agent shall notify the Administrator in writing within 5 days after the completion of a new installation of pretreatment facilities of the time it intends to initiate operation of them. The user shall notify the Administrator of when start-up of new facilities will occur, the time, and the person who will conduct any tests to be performed. The pretreatment facilities shall not be placed in regular operation until the tests have been conducted to establish that the discharges will be in compliance with this chapter. 
(2)  Tests by users. A representative of the city shall be permitted to witness the tests. The cost of the tests shall be paid by the user of the facilities. 
(Ord. No. 53-94, § 2, 10-3-94; Ord. No. 43-04, § 11, 1-3-05) 
2:44.2. - Surveillance report required. 
    The Administrator, by written order, may require any non-domestic user to submit periodic reports in a format specified by the city which shall include information on the quality and quantity of wastewater and pollutants discharged into the POTW. The report shall include the volume of wastewater and concentration of pollutants, and be related to pretreatment standards as shall be required by the Administrator. In cases where a BMP or other pollution control activity is required, the report shall include sufficient documentation for the Administrator to determine compliance. 
    The names of all person(s) responsible for operating and maintaining any pretreatment equipment or pretreatment processes, or responsible for wastewater management at the user's facilities shall be listed in the report with a brief description of each person's duties. The Administrator may also require additional information from users as to materials or substances which may be discharged to the POTW.

2:44.5. - Notification regarding wastes which are otherwise hazardous. 
    Any non-domestic user that discharges to the POTW any substance which, if disposed of other than by discharge to the POTW, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261 or under the rules promulgated under the Michigan Hazardous Waste Management Act ("Michigan Rules") shall notify the Administrator, the U.S. EPA Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the Chief of the Waste Management Division of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality of the discharge. The notice shall be given within 180 days after the discharge first occurs. The notice shall be in writing and shall include the name of the hazardous waste set forth in 40 CFR 261 or the Michigan rules and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the non-domestic user discharges more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notice shall also contain the following information to the extent the information is known and readily available to the non-domestic user: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes. 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of the hazardous constituents in the discharge during that calendar month. 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
    Notification under this subsection must be submitted once for each hazardous waste discharged. Notification under this subsection is not required for pollutants already reported under self-monitoring by non-domestic users under FCPS reporting requirements. A non-domestic user is exempt from notification under this subsection during a calendar month in which the non-domestic user discharges no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). In the case of a new regulation which first regulates a substance as a hazardous waste after August 23, 1990, notification under this subsection shall be made within 90 days of the effective date of the regulation. In any notice submitted under this subsection, the non-domestic user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree the user has determined to be economically practical.

2.  For structures or property with actual or potential improper stormwater inflows, the sewer user, property owner or other responsible person shall be given 90 days to correct the illegal or improper activities or facilities contributing to the discharge, infiltration of inflow into the POTW. If corrective measures to eliminate the illegal or improper discharge, infiltration or inflow into the POTW are not completed and approved by the Utility Administrator or designee, within 90 days from the date of the notice provided in section 2:51.1(15)1, then the Administrator shall impose upon the sewer user, property owner or other responsible person a monthly surcharge in the amount of $100.00 per month until the required corrective measures are completed and approved.

2:65. - Residential Summer service billings. 
    The charge established in section 2:64 shall be applicable to quarterly residential bills rendered in each month, January to June, inclusive, except as hereinafter provided. To eliminate water consumed but not disposed of in public sanitary sewers during "summer" months, sanitary sewer consumption on quarterly bills rendered in each month, July to December, inclusive, shall be based on average daily water consumption during a 30-day winter time period. The 30-day base period will be set from mid-November to mid-December or as close to that time period as possible based on the availability of meter reads. If the calculated consumption for a summer bill is greater than the actual consumption for the period covered by that bill, the customer will be charged based on actual consumption. 
    Where premises are billed on a monthly basis, the bills for 6 consecutive months during the period May through October shall be charged for summer sanitary service using the calculated consumption or actual consumption, whichever is less, as describe in the preceding paragraph. Where sanitary sewer service or water service was not used by a premises during the 30-day base period on which the calculated consumption is based for the customer's "summer" billing periods, this section shall not be applicable but the charges for the "summer" months or quarters shall be based on the rates established in section 2:64. The summer calculation of charges under this section shall not be used unless the calculated average daily consumption is at least 1 unit. Whenever, in the discretion of the Public Services Area Administrator, application of this section would be inequitable because a premises consumes abnormal amounts of water during the winter months or consumes amounts of water of which an abnormal amount or proportion is returned to the public sanitary sewers during the summer months, the Public Service Area Administrator, may bill such customer on the basis of water actually consumed during the month or quarterly period for which the customer is billed and apply the rates specified in section 2:64. Any customer may, at his/her option, elect to be billed for sanitary sewer service on the basis of water actually consumed during each month or quarterly period. Both water service charges and sanitary sewer service charges shall, however, be billed on the same basis, either quarterly or monthly.

2:66. - Private water supply. 
    Where any sanitary sewer service customer uses any private water supply, any portion of which reaches the public sanitary sewers, such private supply shall be metered at the customer's expense and the consumption therefrom shall be added to the consumption from the public water supply and the total shall be used to establish the sanitary sewer service charges, based on water consumed. The quarterly charge in such cases may be fixed by Council resolution. The Council may classify the users of sewer service according to the quantity of water used and charge such rates to the users in each class as it may deem reasonable. Failure to meter any water supply shall not release the customer from paying the sanitary sewer service charge thereon. In such case, the total water consumption shall be estimated by the Public Services Area Administrator and shall be conclusive. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 7-2-07) 
2:67. - Optional arrangement. 
    Any customer may elect to rearrange his water supply pipes and metering for the purpose of eliminating from the total water consumption, the water not disposed of to the public sanitary sewers, or he may elect to establish metering facilities registering the discharge from his premises to the public sanitary sewers. All such arrangements shall be subject to the prior approval of the Public Services Area Administrator and the expense thereof, including installation, maintenance and operation, shall be borne by the customer. While such an approved installation shall be in effect, the rates specified in section 2:64 shall be applied only to the water passing through the meter for water to be returned to the public sanitary sewers or to the sewage actually discharged to the public sanitary sewers. No person shall divert any water metered as water not entering the public sanitary sewers, into the public sanitary sewers. Where any water metered as not entering the public sanitary sewers does enter the public sanitary sewers, the premises shall be billed at the regular sanitary sewer service rates for all water used during all billing periods in which the unlawful diversion of water occurred, if it can be determined, otherwise for a period to be determined in the discretion of the Public Services Area Administrator, but not to exceed 5 years. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 7-2-07)

The charges for non-stormwater discharges to the stormwater system that are permitted by the Public Services Area Administrator according to chapter 33, section 2:217, shall be $1.40 per 1,000 gallons. If non-stormwater discharges to the stormwater system are controlled such that the discharges cease during periods of precipitation, then the above rate shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.3. For any month in which the user discharges into the stormwater system, there shall be a minimum bill for 100,000 gallons. Stormwater discharges exempt from discharge prohibitions under section 2:216(3) are not subject to this charge.

Chapter 32 - CABLE SYSTEMS AND CABLE SERVICE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 31-02, § 1, adopted Aug. 5, 2002, repealed former Ch. 32, §§ 2-100-2-131, which pertained to community antenna television system. Section 2 of said ordinance enacted provisions designated as a new Ch. 32 to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table for a detailed analysis of inclusion. 

2:100. - Findings and purpose. 
(1)  The City Council finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city. Cable technology is rapidly changing, and cable plays an essential role as part of the city's basic infrastructure. Cable television systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them. The City Council finds that public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest. 
(2)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the city's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve city agencies and other public institutions. 
(3)  In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter: 
(a)  Cable should be available to as many city residents as possible. 
(b)  A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs and interests of the city and its residents. 
(c)  A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities. 
(d)  A cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide diverse programming. 
(e)  A cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of the local public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The City Council intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof.

Any easements over or under property owned by the city other than the public rights-of-way shall be negotiated with the city. The city shall be under no obligation to grant such easements. 
(3)  A franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the cable services consistent with this chapter and its franchise agreement. 
(4)  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to circumscribe or limit the valid authority of the city to regulate or franchise the activities of any other communications system or provider of communications services to the full extent permitted by law. Any franchise agreement shall define the services any grantee is authorized to use the public rights-of-way to provide. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02)

Within 30 days of receipt of the comments, the grantee shall submit a revised plan to the city, either incorporating the comments or explaining why the comments were not included. If the city believes the design plan fails to satisfy or is likely to fail to satisfy the grantee's obligations, it may take any appropriate action it is entitled to take under the franchise agreement, this chapter, or other applicable law. The city's review does not excuse any non-performance under the franchise agreement, this chapter or other applicable law.

(a)  Following the commencement of construction of a system upgrade or any similar major construction, monthly until the construction is completed, the grantee shall provide an update on the progress of the upgrade according to the grantee's general plan, unless the city waives such report. 
(b)  Consequences of delays. The grantee must timely complete any required system upgrade, including any institutional network, by the times specified in its franchise agreement, or be able to reasonably justify any delays. For failure to timely complete construction, the grantee shall be in violation of a material provision of its franchise agreement and the city may, in its sole discretion, either grant the grantee an extension of time to complete such construction or implement any enforcement measures specified in the franchise agreement or this chapter, including but not limited to revocation of the franchise. 
(4)  In any franchise agreement the city shall seek to obtain commitments for the grantee to provide at a minimum the following broad categories of video programming: (1) at least 1 Spanish-language channel; and (2) at least the equivalent of 1 other full-time channel in another foreign language or languages appropriate to the population of the Ann Arbor area.

2:107. - Placement of poles and lines. 
    The poles used by grantee's transmission and distribution system, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained on existing utility facilities where possible. No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without the prior approval of the City Administrator or his/her designee with regard to location, height, type, and any other pertinent aspects. No location of any pole or wire holding structure of the grantee shall create a vested interest, and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:108. - Liability and indemnification of city. 
(1)  A grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the city, its officials, boards, commissions, commissioners, agents, and employees, against any and all liability, obligation, damages, penalties, claims, liens, costs, charges, losses and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, expert witnesses and consultants), suits, causes of action, proceedings, judgments, and claims for damages or equitable relief which arise out of this franchise or by reason of any act or omission of a grantee, its personnel, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors, and those which arise out of the construction, operation and maintenance of grantee's cable system, including but not limited to copyright infringements or a failure by the grantee to secure consents from the owners or authorized distributors of programs to be delivered by the cable system; the conduct of the grantee's business in the city; the grantee's enjoyment or exercise of the franchise, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this chapter or the franchise agreement; personal injury, bodily injury, sickness, disease or death to any person or damage to, loss of or destruction of tangible or intangible property, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name, copyright, patent, service mark or any other right of any person, firm or corporation; failure to comply with any federal, state or local statute, ordinance or regulation. 
(2)  The city shall notify a grantee of any claim that is subject to indemnification not later than 10 days after city becomes aware of the claim. 
(3)  If a claim arises, the city shall tender the defense of the claim to the grantee, and grantee shall defend the claim through counsel grantee selects. 
(4)  The city may participate in the defense of a claim at its expense. If the city elects to participate in the defense of the claim, the grantee shall retain the right to settle the claim unilaterally on its own terms and conditions unless the city accepts full responsibility for all damages and costs associated with the claim. 
(5)  The city shall not admit liability in a contested claim in any matter for which indemnification is sought, nor settle or make an offer in an attempt to settle any claim, without grantee's prior consent. 
(6)  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit any governmental immunity to which the city may be entitled. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:109. - Prohibition of discriminatory or preferential practices, subscriber privacy.

This provision shall not be deemed to prohibit the grantee from offering bona fide promotional campaigns to attract individuals to connect to the cable services, so long as such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the city, nor shall this provision be deemed to prohibit the grantee from offering special introductory rates or terms for new subscribers, senior citizens, the handicapped, not-for-profit persons or organizations, or the economically disadvantaged, those living in multiple dwelling units, or other classes of subscribers for whom the grantee has a valid business reason for extending special rates, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner, provided that grantee may not discriminate in rates based on the location of the subscriber. A grantee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal, state, and City Code provisions, and all executive and administrative orders relating to non-discrimination, and shall be entitled to all rights with respect to pricing or other practices that the grantee has pursuant to federal or state laws and regulations. 
(2)  Further, the grantee may not deny access to cable service to any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides. 
(3)  A grantee shall at all times protect the privacy rights of all subscribers under federal, state and local law, including but not limited to those rights secured by the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551, as it may from time to time be amended. 
(4)  A grantee shall not log or keep records of the specific sites or information accessed by a specific subscriber via the Internet, unless (a) the subscriber has given specific, affirmative written consent, which shall be retained by the grantee for 3 years or as long as such logs or records are retained, whichever is longer; or (b) such logs or records are specifically required with respect to a particular subscriber by a federal or state agency to assist in law enforcement activities pursuant to applicable federal or state law.

(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:111. - Franchise fees. 
(1)  A grantee shall pay the city a franchise fee equal to 5% of gross revenues a grantee derives from the operation of the cable system to provide cable services. This section shall be interpreted so that the franchise fee requirements may not be avoided by contract, agency or other arrangement. 
(2)  Any entity other than a grantee that provides service over a grantee's system to subscribers but does not bill subscribers through the cable operator shall pay franchise fees based on its gross revenues derived from the operation of the system to provide cable services, subject to applicable law. 
(3)  Franchise fee payments must be made quarterly. The payment owed for any quarter must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the following quarter. If a grantee fails to make the required payment within 10 days of the date it is due, the city may impose a late charge upon the grantee.

If payment is made more than 40 days after initially due, the grantee shall also pay interest on the unpaid fee and the accrued late charges at the maximum interest rate allowed by law. 
(4)  Each franchise fee payment shall be submitted to the cable administrator with supporting detail and a statement reflecting the total amount of gross revenues for the payment period and a breakdown by major revenue categories (such as basic service, cable programming service, premium service, etc.). The city shall have the right to require further supporting information. 
(5)  The city shall have the right to inspect records and the right to audit the books and records of a grantee, its affiliates, and any other person that constitutes a cable operator of the system to ensure compliance with this section. The grantee shall be responsible for providing to the city all records necessary to confirm the accurate payment of franchise fees, without regard to by whom they are held. The grantee shall maintain such records for a period of at least 6 years. A grantee shall not be entitled to withhold any such materials on the grounds that they are proprietary or confidential. 
(6)  The franchise fee paid to the city by a grantee is compensation for the use and occupation of the public rights-of-way of the city in the operation of the cable system. Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax and shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the city by the grantee such as property taxes, licenses or other fees. No grantee may designate the franchise fee as a tax in any communication to a cable subscriber. 
(7)  The franchise fee revenues received by the city shall be directed to the cost of franchise administration, operation of PEG access television, and communications and media operations of the city. 
(8)  Acceptance of any payment by the city shall not be construed as a release or act as an accord or satisfaction, or in any respect waive the city's right to collect the full amount owed. 
(9)  For purposes of calculating franchise fee payments under applicable franchise provisions, any discount reflected in an aggregated bill for services which include cable services will be allocated in a manner consistent with applicable law, and in the absence of such law, proportionately to cable services provided by the grantee. Such proportional allocations shall be made by the grantee in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02; Ord. No. 7-05, § 1, 3-21-05) 
2:112. - Insurance. 
(1)  Prior to the beginning of any franchise agreement term, a grantee shall obtain, and shall require its contractors to obtain, insurance as set forth below. The grantee must file certificates evidencing its coverage with the city. Such insurance shall be maintained in full force and effect until the end of the franchise agreement term. A franchise agreement shall not commence unless and until the grantee has the required insurance and files the required certificates, and a franchise agreement may be terminated by the city if the grantee fails to maintain the required insurance in effect. In the alternative, a grantee may satisfy this requirement through a program of self-insurance acceptable to the City Administrator or his/her designee. A grantee that wants its program of self-insurance to be accepted must provide reasonable evidence of its financial resources to the city, as well as any other relevant information requested by the city. The city's acceptance of such self-insurance shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(a)  Commercial general liability insurance, including completed operations liability, independent contractors liability, contractual liability coverage, railroad protective coverage and coverage for property damage from perils of explosion, collapse or damage to underground utilities, commonly known as XCU coverage, in an amount not less than $5,000,000.00. 
(b)  Liability insurance for sudden and accidental environmental contamination with minimum limits of $500,000.00 and providing coverage for claims discovered within 3 years after the term of the policy. 
(c)  Automobile liability insurance in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00. 
(d)  Workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance with statutory limits, and any applicable federal insurance of a similar nature. 
(e)  The coverage amounts set forth above may be met by a combination of underlying (primary) and umbrella policies so long as in combination the limits equal or exceed those stated. If more than 1 insurance policy is purchased to provide the coverage amounts set forth above, then all policies providing coverage limits excess to the primary policy shall provide drop down coverage to the first dollar of coverage and other contractual obligations of the primary policy, should the primary policy carrier not be able to perform any of its contractual obligations or not be collectible for any of its coverages for any reason during the term of the grantee's franchise agreement, or, when longer, for as long as coverage could have been available pursuant to the terms and conditions of the primary policy. 
(2)  The city shall be named as an additional insured on all policies other than worker's compensation and employer's liability. All insurance policies shall provide that they shall not be canceled, modified or not renewed unless the insurance carrier provides 30 days prior written notice to the city. A grantee shall annually provide the city with a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage. All insurance policies other than environmental contamination, workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance shall be written on an occurrence basis and not on a claims made basis. 
(3)  All insurance shall be issued by insurance carriers licensed to do business by the State of Michigan or by surplus line carriers on the Michigan Insurance Commission approved list of companies qualified to do business in Michigan. All insurance and surplus line carriers shall be rated A+ or better by A.M. Best Company. 
(4)  If the insurance policies required by this section 2:112 are written with retainages or deductibles in excess of $50,000.00, they shall be approved by the City Administrator or his/her designee in advance in writing. A grantee shall indemnify and save harmless the city from and against the payment of any deductible and from the payment of any premium on any insurance policy required to be furnished hereunder. 
(5)  A grantee's contractors and subcontractors working in the public rights-of-way shall carry in full force and effect commercial general liability, environmental contamination liability, automobile liability and workers' compensation and employer liability insurance which complies with all terms of this section 2:112. In the alternative, a grantee, at its expense, may provide such coverages for any or all its contractors or subcontractors. This may be done by adding them to the grantee's policies. 
(6)  The grantee's insurance coverage shall be primary insurance with respect to the city, its officers, agents, employees, elected and appointed officials, departments, boards, and commissions (collectively "them"). Any insurance or self-insurance maintained by any of them shall be in excess of the grantee's insurance and shall not contribute to it. As used in this section, "insurance or self-insurance maintained by any of them" includes any contract or agreement providing any type of indemnification or defense obligation provided to, or for the benefit of them, from any source, and includes any self-insurance program or policy, or self-insured retention or deductible by, for or on behalf of them. 
(7)  A grantee shall immediately advise the City Attorney of any claim or litigation that may result in liability to the city. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:113. - Use of channels. 
(1)  In addition to providing the access channels required in section 2:114, a grantee shall provide and activate a direct fiber connection from the city's main PEG access center to the cable headend (the location where PEG programming is inserted on the subscriber network), with the capability to transmit all the city's programming for the PEG capacity specified in section 2:114, consistent with at least EIA/TIA-250C medium-haul standards, including transmission of any captioning, stereo audio, and second audio programs (SAP). 
(2)  The obligation to activate the capacity referred to in section 2:113(1) includes the obligation to provide and maintain all equipment required to transmit the signal(s) beginning with baseband signals from the city's main PEG access center into the system through the point of output. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:114. - PEG access. 
(1)  The grantee shall make available to all subscribers on the cable system at least 4 channels for public, educational, and government access use throughout the franchise term and any extensions thereof. All access channels required under this section must be provided by the grantee during the term of the franchise to subscribers of any basic cable service tier. 
(2)  In the event that the grantee delivers all other channels on the cable system in a digital format to all subscribers, it will also deliver any PEG channels in a digital format, and the following additional requirements shall apply: 
(a)  If any access channels are provided to the grantee in a high-definition television format compatible with a format used on the grantee's cable system, the grantee shall carry such access channels in a form that preserves such enhanced quality, using any applicable compression or other techniques at no lower level of quality than it applies to other channels on its system. 
(b)  In addition to those access channels specified in section 2:114(1), which may be carried as specified in section 2:114(2) and 2:114(2)(a), the city may request, and each grantee shall provide, additional bandwidth for PEG purposes up to a maximum of 6 MHz of additional bandwidth. Such PEG bandwidth shall only be requested and provided, however, if the cable commission reasonably determines that (i) the use serves a public, educational, or governmental purpose, and (ii) there is an identified community need or interest in the proposed PEG programming of service; and the grantee reasonably determines that (iii) the proposed use is non-commercial in nature and (iv) the proposed use does not substantially duplicate programming otherwise available on the grantee's cable system. 
(3)  Unless agreed otherwise by the city and the grantee, (i) the PEG channels specified in section 2:114(1) shall be made available on the lowest basic tier offered by the grantee and at a channel position no higher than 45; alternatively, (ii) if additional bandwidth is used pursuant to section 2:114(2)(b), the PEG channels or uses shall be displayed in a contiguous block; and (iii) channel positions shall be the same throughout the city. Without limiting the provisions of the previous 2 sentences, access channel assignments may be changed in the grantee's sole discretion, but may not be changed more often than once every 2 years or more often than 4 times over the life of the renewed franchise without the city's consent. Any such repositioning must be to a channel of technical quality at least equivalent to that of other channels on the system. In any repositioning, grantee shall give as much notice of the planned repositioning to the city as is practical, but not less than 60 days of advance notice. The grantee shall reimburse the city for actual unavoidable expenses incurred in repositioning channels, on account of any necessary change in equipment, promotional materials, office supplies and the like, in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of $5,000.00. In addition, in the event of repositioning, the grantee will cooperate with city in an effort to inform subscribers of the change, and will provide reasonable services such as cross channel promotion, subscriber notices, and scrolled channel messages. 
(4)  The city shall operate the access channels specified in section 2:114(1), (2). 
(5)  A grantee is prohibited from censoring any PEG programming which is cablecast, except to the extent that federal law allows. 
(6)  A grantee shall provide a capital grant to the city (the "PEG Capital Facilities Grant") as specified in the franchise agreement, to be used by the city, in its sole discretion, in a manner consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(C). 
(a)  In any franchise agreement the city shall obtain commitments from that grantee to provide capital grants that total at least 2% of that grantee's gross revenues. 
(b)  A grantee shall make its capital grant payments quarterly at the same time and in the same manner as its franchise fee payments, unless otherwise provided in its franchise agreement. 
(c)  Any real or personal property acquired by the city through the PEG capital facilities grant and used for or in support of PEG access, shall be the property of the city. 
(7)  The city shall require all users of the public access facilities or channels to indemnify and hold harmless the city and the grantee from any and all liability or other injury (including the reasonable cost of defending claims or litigation) arising from or in connection with claims for failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations or other requirements of local, state, or federal authorities, including but not limited to claims of libel, slander, obscenity, invasion of privacy, or the infringement of common law or statutory copyright; unauthorized use of any trademark, trade name or service mark; breach of contractual or other obligations owing to third parties by the grantee or the city; and any other injury, damages or penalties which result from the use of the public access channels or facilities. All such users shall be required to agree to such indemnification in writing prior to use of a public access facility or channel. The form of the indemnification shall be reasonably acceptable to a grantee. 
(8)  All payments made under this section are not franchise fee payments and fall within 1 of the exceptions to 47 U.S.C. Section 542(g). 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:115. - Rules, records and reports. 
(1)  The city shall have full and complete access to any of the grantee's records that relate to the city's lawful rights or authority under this chapter or other applicable law or agreements, including without limitation customer service issues. Such records may include, but are not limited to, all books, receipts, maps, performance test results, plans, contracts, engineering, accounting, financial, statistical, customer and service records, and reports to stockholders, in whatever manner kept. Upon reasonable notice, the grantee shall make its books and records available for inspection by the city or to designated representatives at the local office or, by mutual agreement of the city and the grantee, at another location within 25 miles of the city. The city shall have the right to inspect any such records, and may copy any such records except that if grantee reasonably asserts that non-financial records not covered by section 2:111 are trade secrets or confidential and proprietary, then the grantee need not consent to copying under this chapter unless city covenants that confidential and proprietary information copied will not be subject to public disclosure. This includes not only the books and records of the grantee, but any books and records the city reasonably deems relevant that are held by an affiliate, a cable operator of the cable system, or any contractor, subcontractor or any person holding any form of management contract for the cable system. 
(2)  On or before the 61st day following the end of each calendar year, each grantee shall file with the city an annual report including the following upon the city's request if made before the end of the previous year: 
(a)  A summary of written complaints (including those received by e-mail or recorded in writing by the grantee), identifying both the number and nature of the complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions, as such records are kept by the grantee. Where complaints involve recurrent cable system problems, the nature of each problem and the corrective measures taken shall be identified: 
(b)  A summary of the results of, and/or, at the grantee's option, copies of the cable system's technical tests and measurements performed during the past year; 
(c)  A summary of the cable system's reliability, and the reliability of any cable modem service delivered, if different; 
(d)  A copy of updated as-built maps depicting the location of all cable plant (including I-Net plant), showing areas served and locations of all trunk lines and feeder lines in the city, including changes in all such items for the period of the report, and including GIS files in a format established by the Michigan Public Service Commission or acceptable to the city; 
(e)  A full schedule of all generally applicable subscriber rates, fees, and charges; 
(f)  The grantee's policies regarding subscriber privacy; 
(g)  Such other information as the city may from time to time request with respect to the operation, of the grantee's cable system and service within the city. 
(3)  Within 10 days of the adoption of any written policies, practices, procedures, terms or conditions significantly impacting subscribers, grantee shall file a copy of such rules, regulations, terms or conditions with the city. 
(4)  A grantee shall submit to the city a monthly subscriber activity report within 20 days from the end of the preceding month, including: 
(a)  Number of subscribers for each type of cable service. 
(b)  Trouble code resolution data, pursuant to the form attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Addendum A. 
(c)  Outage report, pursuant to the form attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Addendum B. 
(d)  A report detailing the grantee's gross revenues for the month, including a breakdown by type of service, pursuant to the form attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter as Addendum C. 
(e)  The percentage of time the grantee's call center telephone trunk(s) serving Ann Arbor are busy. 
(f)  The percentage of calls to the grantee's call center serving Ann Arbor that are answered within 30 seconds. 
(g)  The percentage of installations in Ann Arbor completed within 7 business days of the request from a subscriber. 
(h)  The number of service call windows missed as a percentage of all service calls in Ann Arbor. 
(i)  A breakdown of the number of service complaints by type. 
(j)  An overview of the promotional offers generally made available during the month in the franchise area. 
(5)  The city may request further information regarding the points covered in this report pursuant to section 2:115(1). 
(6)  If the information provided pursuant to section 2:115(4) does not take into account any exclusion for periods not under normal operating conditions, the grantee shall so inform the city in its monthly report, and the grantee will provide upon request the corresponding information adjusted for any such exclusion. 
(7)  A grantee shall annually provide, within 120 days of the close of its fiscal year, an unaudited balance sheet and income statement of grantee for the preceding fiscal year, certified by an officer of the grantee as true and accurate to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. In addition, the grantee shall furnish a statement of revenues for its operations in the city for the same fiscal period, which shall be furnished with the unaudited fiscal statements referred to above. The report shall be in a form suitable for the city to accomplish the review of basic rates and the audit and review of gross revenues and franchise fee and PEG capital facilities grants made pursuant to the grantee's franchise. The statement of revenues shall separate grantee's revenues between basic service, cable programming services, premium services, and other sources of revenue, including a breakdown of revenue by type of service. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:116. - Rates. 
(1)  The city may regulate rates except as prohibited by state or federal law. 
(2)  Except to the extent it would be prohibited from doing so by state or federal law, at all times the grantee shall notify the city and all subscribers at least 30 days in advance before adding additional services, or if it proposes to materially alter existing services. 
(3)  The provisions of this section govern the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment within the city for any grantee subject to rate regulation by the city pursuant to applicable law. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission "FCC") regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full herein. If any provision of these regulations shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid, unenforceable, or preempted by federal law or regulation, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other respects and continue to be effective. The grantee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is prohibited from engaging in under FCC rules and regulations, as if those rules and regulations were set forth in full herein. For purposes of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. § 76.901 and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47 C.F.R. § 76.923(a)(1). No delay or failure to enforce any provision of these regulations shall operate against the city as an estoppel or waiver. 
(4)  Rate filings. 
(a)  Initial rate filings. A grantee that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission ("initial rate filing") within 30 days of the notification, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by governing law. The initial rate filing shall justify the grantee's basic service and equipment rates in accordance with FCC rules. All rates, for all customer classifications, must be justified, except to the extent that such rates are specifically exempted from regulation by FCC regulations or other governing law. 
(b)  Subsequent rate filings. 
(i)  Once a grantee has been notified by the city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service or equipment without making any rate filings required by applicable law and obtaining such prior approval of the city as may be required under governing regulations. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of notice, except insofar as governing law specifically permits a grantee to raise rates without prior approval. 
(ii)  In addition, a grantee must submit a rate filing at any other time such a filing is required under FCC rules, or by the city in accordance with such rules. 
(iii)  For purposes of this section, a "rate increase" occurs when there is either an increase in rates, or a new basic service or equipment rate, or a decrease in program or customer services without a corresponding decrease in rates. 
(iv)  Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review at least 30 days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement. 
(v)  A grantee shall provide at least 30 days' notice (or such longer period as may be specified in FCC regulations) to subscribers and to the city of any proposed changes in basic service tier or equipment rates, whether or not the grantee believes the affected rates are subject to regulation, except to the extent such notice requirement is specifically waived by governing law. 
(c)  Filing: where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the cable administrator. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date a facially complete rate filing is received by the cable administrator. Information that the grantee claims is proprietary under section 2:116(4)(d)(iii)(B) must be clearly identified and segregated from the remainder of the filing and clearly marked so that the city may determine where and how the proprietary information was used to determine rates. 
(d)  Filing: contents. 
(i)  Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a grantee must show that the rates the grantee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. 
(ii)  The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms. 
(iii)  Every rate filing must clearly state in a cover letter: 
(A)  Any changes the rate filing proposes, in the form of a brief, narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service; 
(B)  Whether any pages of the rate filing contain information that the grantee claims is proprietary, listing any such pages. 
(5)  Review of rate filings. 
(a)  Receipt and notice of rate filings. 
(i)  After receiving a rate filing, the city promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties a reasonable time, in light of the dates by which the City Council must issue its orders, to submit written comments on the filing to the Cable Communications Commission. 
(ii)  The grantee shall notify the city as soon as possible of any deficiencies it may discover in a rate filing, and shall submit an amended filing in accordance with the filing requirements of section 2:116(4)(c), (d) as soon as possible (and in any event within 5 business days, unless the city waives this deadline) to cure such deficiencies, together with a full explanation of the deficiencies and the correction. However, the provisions of subsection 2:116(5)(a)(i) shall not apply to any refilings or corrected filings made by a grantee to replace, amend, or supplement an initial rate filing. 
(b)  Final rate order. 
(i)  After completing its review of a grantee's rate filing and any additional information submitted in response to information requests, the cable administrator may submit any comments received and the cable administrator's recommendations for action to the City Administrator. The City Administrator may make recommendations to the City Council and, if so, shall make the City Administrator's recommendations available for public inspection. When such recommendations are submitted, the City Administrator may set a reasonable deadline by which the grantee may submit a response to public comments or to the City Administrator's recommendations. The grantee's response shall be filed with the cable administrator, and if it is submitted in a timely fashion, the cable administrator shall forward a copy to the City Council. 
(ii)  After reviewing the City Administrator's recommendations, the City Council may issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part, or denying the proposed rate in whole or in part and determining maximum permitted rates pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. 
(iii)  The City Administrator may make partial recommendations regarding particular rates, and the City Council may issue partial orders setting particular rates and ordering refunds and other appropriate relief with regard to such rates, consistent with the Cable Act, without prejudice to their right to make further recommendations and issue further orders in accordance with applicable FCC regulations. 
(c)  Refunds. If a rate order determines that refunds should be provided to subscribers, the grantee shall file with the cable administrator, within the time period specified in that order, a detailed calculation of the appropriate refunds, including interest, to all relevant classes of subscribers, and a description of its proposed refund methodology, together with all supporting materials necessary to allow the cable administrator to verify the grantee's calculations. The grantee's calculations shall also show, in detail, how the grantee proposes to calculate any portion of the refund properly attributable to franchise fees. The cable administrator may require further supporting information with regard to the grantee's calculations, and the grantee must provide all such information reasonably necessary to determine the refund and franchise fee amounts. 
(d)  Provisions generally applicable to rate orders. 
(i)  Orders relating to rate regulation ("rate orders") shall be written and may be issued in any lawful form. 
(ii)  Any rate order that establishes maximum permitted rates for basic cable service, equipment or installation, or requires refunds to cable subscribers ("final rate order"), shall be issued by the City Council. Any other orders, including without limitation (1) orders that toll deadlines for review and (2) orders that allow rates to take effect subject to refund and/or direct a cable operator to keep an accurate account of all amounts received and on whose behalf such amounts were paid, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.933(a)-(c), may be issued by the cable administrator. 
(iii)  Each final rate order shall be released to the public and the grantee, and a public notice shall be published stating that the final rate order has been issued and is available for review. 
(iv)  The city may take any actions that are consistent with the rate regulation authority delegated to it by the Cable Act or governing regulations. 
(v)  Notice and opportunity to comment. Before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the City Council shall ensure the grantee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the City Administrator propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the grantee at the time it is submitted to the City Council shall be deemed to provide the grantee this notice, and the grantee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations. 
(vi)  No order approving or setting a rate pursuant to FCC regulations shall be deemed to establish a just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should the FCC revise its rules for calculating the maximum permitted rates, the city shall have the right to reduce a grantee's rates and to require the grantee to refund any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by governing law. 
(6)  Grantees' duties. 
(a)  It is each grantee's duty to submit as complete a rate filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as a violation of this chapter, subject to any applicable sanctions and remedies under FCC regulations, this chapter, and any other applicable law or contract. 
(b)  Each grantee is responsible for the continuing accuracy and completeness of information furnished to the city. Whenever information furnished by a grantee is no longer accurate and complete in all significant respects, the grantee shall correct such deficiencies as required herein. 
(c)  A grantee must respond to requests for information from the cable administrator by reasonable deadlines established by the cable administrator (including requests that specified information be submitted at the time of future rate filings). A grantee is responsible for ensuring that any other entity that has records of revenues or expenses that are allocated to the grantee's system responds to the cable administrator's requests. 
(d)  A grantee must implement remedial requirements, including prospective rate reductions and refunds, as soon as possible after an order requiring such remedies is issued, but in any case within 60 days of the date the City Council issues an order mandating a remedy. However, if FCC regulations require the grantee to implement a remedy more quickly, or require that the grantee be allowed more time to implement a remedy, then the FCC requirement shall control. 
(e)  Within 30 days after implementing a remedy, but in no event more than 90 days after the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a grantee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the grantee: 
(i)  Stating whether the grantee has complied fully with all provisions of the City Council's order; 
(ii)  Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the City Council's order; and 
(iii)  Describing in detail any respects in which the grantee has not complied fully with all provisions of the City Council's order; and 
(iv)  Showing how any applicable refunds (including interest) were calculated and distributed. 
(7)  The City Administrator or his/her designee shall be responsible for administering the provisions of section 2:116. Without limitation and by way of illustration, the City Administrator or his/her designee: 
(a)  Shall ensure notices are given to the public and each grantee as required herein and by FCC regulations. 
(b)  May submit requests for information to the grantee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided herein. 
(c)  For good cause, may waive any provision herein or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters as are mandatory under FCC regulations. 
(d)  Shall rule on any request for confidentiality. 
(e)  Shall prepare the recommendations to the City Council contemplated by this section. 
(8)  If the City Administrator recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in part, he/she shall: 
(a)  Propose a rate and explain the basis for the recommendation (it may propose that rates remain at existing levels); and 
(b)  Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should be issued; and 
(c)  Notify the grantee of the recommendation at the time it is submitted to the City Council. 
(9)  Except as prohibited by federal law, a grantee shall be subject to penalties and forfeitures under this chapter, and its request for approval of a rate may be denied if it: 
(a)  Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in connection with any rate proceeding; 
(b)  Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city, including, but not limited to, a request for information or an order setting rates; or 
(c)  Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. 
(10)  Disclosure of information. 
(a)  All materials filed with the city in connection with rate regulation shall be subject to release, or exemption from release, in accordance with applicable federal and state law. 
(b)  Information that the operator claims is proprietary must be clearly identified. If it is part of a larger submission, such as a rate filing, the proprietary information must be segregated from the remainder of the submission. It must also be clearly marked so that the city may determine where the proprietary information belongs within the submission, how it relates to the remainder of the submission, and the basis for the grantee's claim that the marked material is proprietary. 
(c)  The cable administrator shall promptly, and before any decision as to any release of such information, notify the grantee in writing of any request to release material the operator claims is proprietary. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:117. - Necessity of franchise and application process. 
(1)  No person shall own or operate a cable system in the city except by franchise expressly issued by the city granting such power to any such grantee. 
(2)  A written application shall be filed with the city for the grant of an initial franchise or modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545. To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with 6 copies. The application must be accompanied by any required application filing fee, conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain all required information. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all applicants with respect to the application.

(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:118. - Construction, maintenance, and operation of facilities. 
(1)  System tests and inspections. 
(a)  The grantee shall perform all tests reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the franchise agreement, this chapter, and other performance standards established by law or regulation or by a franchise agreement, and to ensure that the system components are operating as expected. All tests shall be conducted in accordance with federal rules where applicable. 
(b)  The city may also conduct inspections of all parts of the system (including without limitation any I-Net), including but not limited to inspections to assess compliance with FCC technical standards and generally applicable construction and safety codes. Inspection does not relieve the grantee of its obligation to build in compliance with all provisions of the franchise. 
(c)  The city reserves the right to conduct its own tests upon reasonable notice to the grantee. The city will endeavor to arrange any request for such tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the grantee or to subscribers. 
(d)  The results of any tests or technical reports required by the FCC shall be filed with the city upon request, within 2 weeks after such request. The grantee shall retain in writing such results. 
(e)  If any test indicates that any part or component of the system fails to meet applicable requirements, the grantee, without requirement of additional notice or request from the city, shall take corrective action, retest the locations and advise the city of the action taken and results achieved. 
(2)  Publicizing proposed construction work. The grantee shall notify the public prior to commencing any proposed construction that will significantly disturb or disrupt public property or have the potential to present a danger or affect the safety of the public generally. The grantee shall publicize proposed construction work at least 1 week prior to commencement of that work by causing written notice of such construction work to be delivered to the city and by notifying those persons most likely to be affected by the work in at least 2 of the following ways: by telephone, in person, by mail, by distribution of flyers to residences, by publication in local newspapers, or in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice. In addition, before entering onto any person's property (except in case of an emergency, including emergency repairs), the grantee shall make reasonable efforts to contact the property owner or (in the case of residential property) the resident in advance. 
(3)  Compliance with FCC rules. All maintenance performed on the cable system by the grantee shall be in accordance with the FCC rules and regulations governing the technical performance and operating standards for such system where applicable. 
(4)  Audio. All programming transmitted by the system, including PEG access programming, that contains stereo audio or closed-captioning shall include such features as provided by the program originator without substantial alteration or deterioration. Any PEG access facility interconnection links shall also be constructed and operated so that any such audio features included by the program originator shall be included in the programming as received by subscribers. 
(5)  A grantee shall ensure that hearing impaired customers can contact the company by TDD/TTY or equivalent methods. 
(6)  A grantee shall promulgate and adhere to a preventive maintenance policy directed toward maximizing the reliability (mean time between malfunctions) and maintainability (mean time to repair) of its cable system. A grantee shall maintain a repair department comprised of trained technicians, service vehicles and equipment to provide quality repair service. Service shall be rendered efficiently and repairs made promptly. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:119. - Signal quality requirements. 
(1)  A grantee shall: 
(a)  Transmit signals capable of producing a picture, whether in black and white or color, that do not exhibit noticeable disturbances such as ghost images, crosstalk, and intermodulation products, and accompanied with proper sound of good quality on typical standard production TV sets in good repair; 
(b)  Transmit signals of adequate strength to produce good pictures with good sound at all outlets without causing cross modulation in the cables or interfering with other electrical or electronic systems; 
(c)  Limit failures to a minimum by locating and correcting malfunctions promptly, but in no event longer than 48 hours after notice; 
(d)  Demonstrate upon request by instruments or otherwise to subscribers that a signal of adequate strength and quality is being delivered. 
(2)  A grantee must at all times meet or exceed technical standards established by the Federal Communications Commission. 
(3)  The system shall be so constructed and operated that there is no significant deterioration in the quality of PEG access signals or leased access signals, either upstream or downstream, as compared with other channels on the system. Deterioration refers to any signal problem, including but not limited to ghost images and other interference and distortions. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:120. - Availability of facilities. 
(1)  Availability of cable service. 
(a)  A grantee shall offer service to all residences, businesses and other structures within the city, including multiple dwelling unit buildings, whose owners or occupants request cable service, except for (i) those residences, businesses and other structures that do not qualify under the line extension criteria specified in section 2:120(3), and (ii) multiple dwelling unit buildings to which the grantee cannot legally obtain access. 
(b)  The grantee shall provide service consistent with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(3) (prohibiting redlining) and Chapter 112 of the City Code. 
(2)  The city may in a franchise agreement specify a construction schedule for a grantee. A grantee may refuse to provide cable service to property to which it does not have direct access from its distribution system because of physical or legal obstructions. 
(3)  Grantee shall extend cable service at then-prevailing standard installation charges to any unit or building upon request, so long as (a) the unit for which service is requested is located within 150 feet of the cable system; or (b) measuring from any 1 point on the system to the unit for which service is requested, there is an average density of 16 or more residential units per mile; or (c) the service is requested for a public school building located within the city. Individual residences in multiple dwelling units ("MDU") shall be included as individual "homes" in the count of homes per mile. However, the grantee shall not be required to count such residences or to extend its distribution system solely to serve an MDU that has not provided permission to the grantee to enter the property. 
(4)  In other cases, where the potential subscriber is located outside the 150-foot limit, the grantee shall also extend cable service, but the grantee may require the person or persons requesting service to agree to pay the actual material and labor costs incurred in extending service to their unit or units in excess of those the grantee is required to bear under this section. For example, if cable service is requested for a unit, and the average density to that unit is 9 units rather than 16 units per mile, the grantee must bear at least 9/16 of the actual cost of the extension, and may require the person requesting service to bear the remaining 7/16 of the cost. This line extension requirement may be waived in writing by the City Administrator for good cause shown. 
(5)  Grantee shall extend its cable system under section 2:120(3) to serve any requesting unit located within the franchise area within 90 days of the request. An exemption from this requirement is the "downtown" area of Ann Arbor, defined as the area bounded by Ashley, East Ann, North State and East Williams, where subject to construction conditions, cable service will be provided within 120 days, except as otherwise provided in the customer service standards as may now exist or may hereafter be established. Each deadline can be extended by the cable administrator for delays beyond the control of the grantee, including securing rights-of-way, construction permits and any other necessary authorizations. 
(6)  Unless otherwise specified in a franchise agreement, each grantee shall, without charge, upon the request of the city, provide 1 activated cable drop to connect each fire station in the city, each public elementary and secondary school within the city, and the Ann Arbor District Library (Main Branch) to the cable system, as well as up to 6 such activated drops, as requested by the city, for City Hall. The grantee shall not be required to make any such installation until it is requested to do so by the respective unit of government or educational institutions. The grantee shall provide basic service tiers 1, 2, and 3, or their equivalent (as such tiers were in effect on January 1, 2002), and any equipment necessary to receive such service, free of charge, to each such site. 
(7)  Continuity of service. 
(a)  A grantee shall use its best efforts to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service. At the city's request, the grantee shall operate its system for a temporary period (the "transition period") following the termination of its franchise as necessary to maintain service to subscribers, and shall cooperate with the city to assure an orderly transition from it to another grantee. The transition period shall be no longer than the reasonable period required to ensure that cable service will be available to subscribers and that any institutional network remains available to the city, and shall not be longer than 24 months, unless extended by the city and the grantee for good cause. During the transition period, the grantee will continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement and applicable laws and regulations. 
(b)  If a grantee abandons its system during the franchise term, or fails to operate its system in accordance with the terms of this agreement during any transition period, the city, at its option, may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system temporarily until the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or until the franchise is revoked and a new grantee selected by the city is providing service, or obtain an injunction requiring the grantee to continue operations. If the city is required to operate or designate another entity to operate the cable system, the grantee shall reimburse the city or its designee for all reasonable costs and damages incurred that are in excess of the revenues from the cable system. 
(c)  Without limitation, the following examples would constitute abandonment for purposes of section 2:120(7)(b): a grantee fails or refuses to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area for 96 consecutive hours, unless the city authorizes a longer interruption of service or the failure is due to force majeure as characterized in its franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:121. - Emergency use of facilities. 
(1)  Emergency alert. A cable system must be engineered, installed and maintained to provide an emergency alert system that complies with FCC regulations. 
(2)  Local alert. In addition, a cable system must allow certain authorized city and county officials to automatically override the audio and video signals of all channels on the cable system and transmit and report emergency information. Such overrides may be by means of (for example) direct telephone call-in by the city's emergency management division or by reception of wireless transmissions from the county emergency management division. The city shall contact any affected grantee when such an alert is triggered. The city and any grantee shall provide each other with contact persons who may be reached in case an alert is triggered. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:122. - Safety requirements. 
    All safety practices required by law shall be used by a grantee and its agents during construction, maintenance, and repair of the cable system. A grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisance to the public. A grantee shall install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the codes of the city and all codes adopted by reference therein and in such a manner that they will not interfere with any installations or property of the city or any properly placed property of any public utility serving the city. 
    All structures and all lines, equipment and connections in the city, wherever situated and located, shall at all times be kept and maintained by the grantee in a safe, suitable, substantial condition, and in good order and repair. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:123. - Conditions of street occupancy. 
(1)  All transmissions and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by a grantee in the city shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who abut any of the said public rights-of-way. 
(2)  In case of disturbance, or damage to any public right-of-way or other public or private property during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance, or reconstruction of a cable system, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner to be approved by the City Administrator or other appropriate official delegated by him, replace and restore such public right-of-way or property in as good a condition as before the work done by grantee causing such disturbance or damage. 
(3)  If, at any time during the period of this franchise, the city shall lawfully elect to alter, repair, construct, or change the grade or location of any public right-of-way, to improve the public rights-of-way, or to construct, install, or repair any sewers, drains, pipes, power lines, or any other type of public works or government owned utility, or for any other purpose where the convenience of the city would be served thereby, a grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by the city, remove, relay, support, protect, temporarily disconnect, and/or relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures or any of its property, at its own expense. 
(4)  Any poles, or other fixtures or plant and equipment placed in any public rights-of-way by said grantee, shall be placed in such a manner as shall not unnecessarily hinder or obstruct usual vehicular or pedestrian travel on such public rights-of-way. 
(5)  A grantee shall, on request of any person holding a building permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the movement of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange such temporary wire changes. 
(6)  The construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of the system shall be in accordance with all applicable sections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended; the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended; the most current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code and National Electric Code; the city's electrical code; Obstruction Marking and Lighting, AC 70/7460 i.e., Federal Aviation Administration; Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures, Federal Communications Commission Rules Part 17; any other applicable federal, state, or local laws and regulations that may apply to the operation, construction, maintenance, or repair of a cable system, including, without limitation, local zoning and construction codes and laws and accepted industry practices, all as hereafter may be amended or adopted. In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most stringent code or standard shall apply (except insofar as those standard, if followed, would result in a system that could not meet requirements of federal, state or local law, or is expressly preempted by other such standards). The construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of the system shall be in accordance with good engineering practices. The grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public. 
(7)  In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work required for the protection or restoration of the public rights-of-way, or any other work required by the City Code, within the time specified by and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, the city, following notice and an opportunity to cure, may cause such work to be done, and the grantee shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within 30 days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs; or the city may recover such costs through the security fund provided by grantee. 
(8)  In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may remove, relay, or relocate any or all parts of that cable system without prior notice. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:124. - Transfer of franchise and change of control of grantee. 
(1)  No transfer shall occur unless prior application is made by a grantee to the city. Prior approval of the Council shall be required where control of a grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons or where the franchise is transferred to any other person or group of persons. If certain conditions precedent are met as set forth below, and if that person or group of persons is willing to accept such lawful covenants, terms and conditions as the city deems appropriate, such approval shall not be unduly withheld. 
(2)  At least 120 calendar days before the contemplated effective date of a transfer, the grantee shall submit to the city a written application for approval of the transfer. The application shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including without limitation details on the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee. At a minimum, the application shall include: 
(a)  FCC Form 394, or any successor form; 
(b)  A complete and un-redacted copy of the agreements to effectuate the proposed transaction and all schedules, exhibits, and other documents attached to them, and any documents referred to in them that are material to the proposed transaction or the grantee's operations in the city and are not otherwise publicly available, except as otherwise provided in section 2:124(3); 
(c)  Information relating to the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the proposed transferee; 
(d)  A statement by the proposed transferee that the proposed transaction will have no material adverse financial impact on the grantee or the cable system, or, if such an adverse impact is anticipated, an explanation thereof; 
(e)  A statement of projected income, expense, and capital expenditures covering the lesser of 5 years or the remainder of the franchise term and explaining the assumptions upon which the projection is based; 
(f)  A general description of the anticipated management structure of the post-transfer cable system and of any financing to be used in connection with the proposed transaction; and 
(g)  A statement by the proposed transferee that the proposed transaction will have no material adverse impact on subscriber rates or service. 
(3)  Any transfer review period established by federal law will not begin until all documents and information required by section 2:124(2), without exception, have been provided to the city; provided, however, that the grantee may redact confidential, proprietary, or trade secret materials in the documents required by section 2:124(2)(b) if it satisfies the requirements of section 2:124(4). 
(4)  In the event that a grantee redacts material otherwise required by section 2:124(2)(b), it shall be the responsibility of the grantee at the time the application is filed to: (i) identify those materials redacted; (ii) provide a description of the information that would otherwise have appeared in the redacted materials; (iii) provide a reasonable confidentiality agreement which, if executed, would give the city immediate access to all the redacted material which, in the city's reasonable judgment, is material to the proposed transaction or the grantee's operations in the city. In the event that the city does not accept the confidentiality agreement offered by grantee, grantee shall take all reasonable steps to conclude with the city or its representatives, within 5 business days after submission of its application (the "confidentiality review period"), a confidentiality agreement allowing review of all redacted material subject to reasonable terms and conditions. If the city or its representatives and the grantee execute such an agreement within the confidentiality review period, then any transfer review period will begin at the time of execution, if the application is otherwise complete pursuant to applicable law. If the city or its representatives and the grantee do not execute such an agreement within the confidentiality review period, then the grantee and the city shall be deemed to have reserved all rights as to whether any transfer review period established by federal law has begun, except that in such case the grantee and the city shall be deemed to have agreed that no such review period began prior to the calendar day immediately following the confidentiality review period. 
(5)  Any transfer may be conditioned on the following, without limitation, at the city's discretion: 
(a)  The proposed transferee must agree to comply with all of the provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(b)  The proposed transferee must resolve any reasonable objections to its financial, legal, or technical qualifications.

(e)  All violations of this chapter and the franchise agreement must be resolved. 
(f)  A transfer application submitted after the effective date of this chapter shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable filing fee, payable to the city, in the amount of $2,500.00. In addition, the city may, if consistent with applicable law, require the applicant to reimburse the city for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in considering the application, including consultants' fees, up to a maximum of $15,000.00 including the $2,500.00 filing fee. 
(6)  Encumbrancing of franchise. A grantee shall be entitled at its option and at any time or from time to time, without the necessity of obtaining the consent or approval of the city, to grant liens on or security interests in its right, title, interest in, to and under the franchise granted pursuant hereto and/or the assets and properties of the grantee's cable system, upon such terms, covenants and conditions as the grantee may agree upon with the party or parties to which such liens or security interests may be granted (such party or parties are hereinafter referred to as "secured parties"). In addition, any of the secured parties may, in connection with the grant of such liens and security interests, exercise all rights and remedies accruing to such secured parties under and pursuant to the security agreements and other instruments and documents executed and delivered by and between the grantee and secured parties, and, in addition thereto, all right and remedies of a secured party under the uniform commercial code and as otherwise available at law, including, without limitations, foreclosure, possession, and realization upon the grantee's right, title and interest in, to and under the franchise granted pursuant hereto, through the sale or other disposition of such franchise and the other encumbered property or otherwise, all without the necessity of obtaining any consent or approval of the city. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:125. - Removal of facilities. 
    Cable home wiring installed in residential single-family homes shall be owned by the property owner beginning at the time of installation. Upon termination of service to any subscriber, the subscriber or property owner may request a grantee to remove any aerial drop from the premises of such subscriber, and the grantee shall do so upon such request within 15 days. Cost of removal shall be borne by grantee. 
(Ord. No. 31-02, § 2, 8-5-02) 
2:126. - Customer service standards. 
(1)  During the franchise term, the city may, after giving all grantees an opportunity to comment, establish and enforce customer service standards for cable systems except as it is prohibited from doing so by federal or state law. In addition, a grantee shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter requirements established by FCC regulations, or other applicable federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or written agreements with the city, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  A grantee shall designate an agent in Ann Arbor responsible for the handling of service complaints. Subscribers shall be informed in writing by the grantee about procedures concerning the handling of complaints at the time of installation and at least once annually. A grantee must create a written record if a subscriber asks to speak with a supervisor while speaking with a customer service representative. Within 30 days after a written complaint from a subscriber, the grantee shall respond to such complaint, filing a complete copy of the complaint and the grantee's response with the cable administrator (with personally identifiable information redacted as may be necessary pursuant to federal law). 
(3)  Telephone and office availability.

(b)  Each grantee will maintain at least 1 local, toll-free or collect call telephone access line which will be available to subscribers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Trained representatives of a grantee shall be available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries at least from 9:00 a.m. to midnight Monday through Friday and at least 16 hours on weekends. Customer service operators shall identify themselves by at least their first names or company IDs immediately upon initial contact. 
(c)  Under normal operating conditions, the following standards shall be met by a grantee at least 90% of the time, measured quarterly. 
(i)  Telephone answering time shall not exceed 30 seconds, and the time to transfer the call to a customer service representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional 30 seconds. 
(ii)  A customer will receive a busy signal less than 3% of the time. 
(iii)  When no employee or agent of the grantee is available to answer a telephone, an answering machine or service capable of receiving and recording service complaints and inquiries shall be employed. Inquiries received after hours must be responded to by a trained representative of a grantee on the next business day. Any answering service employed by a grantee shall keep records of all service calls received and their disposition. 
(d)  A grantee must hire sufficient staff so that it can adequately respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and requests for service in its office, over the phone, and at the subscriber's residence. 
(4)  Scheduling and completing service. 
(a)  Prompt service. 
(i)  A grantee shall complete all installations located up to 125 feet from a grantee's existing distribution system within 7 business days after the order is placed.

(iv)  A grantee shall commence repairs for all other service interruptions within 24 hours after the grantee becomes aware of the interruption, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. 
(v)  A grantee shall commence work on all requests for service other than service interruptions by the next business day after it receives the request for service or otherwise becomes aware of the need for service. 
(vi)  All service for a which a completion time is not otherwise specified in this section 2:126(4) must be completed within 3 days from the commencement of repairs, unless the customer requests a later date, or unless, for reasons beyond the grantee's control, the work could not be completed in those time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence, in which case the grantee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible. The failure of a grantee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not justify a grantee's failure to comply with this provision. 
(vii)  A grantee shall keep a maintenance service log indicating the nature of each service request, the date and time it was received, the disposition of said request and the time and date thereof.

(d)  Cancellations. A grantee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after 6:00 p.m. on the business day preceding the appointment, unless the appointment is for a Monday, in which case the grantee may not cancel after 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. If a grantee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the subscriber will be contacted, and the appointment rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is reasonably convenient for the subscriber. 
(e)  Other inquiries. Under normal operating conditions, billing inquiries and requests for service, repair, and maintenance not involving service interruptions must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative prior to the end of the next business day, provided, however, that that time period for response to inquiries and requests via regular or electronic mail shall not begin to run until the next business day if such mail is not received during business hours, and that unless such mail is sent to an address publicly made available for customer inquiries or requests, the time shall not begin to run until the mail is reviewed by an individual recipient. A grantee shall respond to all other inquiries within 5 business days of the inquiry or complaint. 
(f)  Each grantee shall actively participate in customer service programs offered by the industry, such as NCTA's "on time guarantee," to compensate subscribers for missed appointments.

Except as federal law may otherwise require, in any area where a grantee would be entitled to install a drop above-ground, the grantee will provide the homeowner the option to have the drop installed underground if requested, but may charge the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of the above-ground installation and the actual cost of the underground installation. 
(6)  Interruptions of service. A grantee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. If such an intentional interruption is expected to last for 2 hours or more, then the grantee must give all affected subscribers at least 48 hours' advance notice, except (a) in emergency situations, (b) to the extent necessary to fix the affected subscriber's service problems, or (c) if such notice would slow down the grantee's rectification of the problem. Interruptions associated wit h planned maintenance or construction that occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. shall not require such notice to subscribers. 
(7)  Notice to subscribers.

Written notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of 30 days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. A grantee shall publish its standard rates and charges, including but not limited to charges for all cable services, equipment, installation, repair, deposits, and late fees, indicating the effective date of such rates and charges, making rate cards available at the grantee's office(s) and at the city's cable office. 
(c)  All grantee promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately disclose price terms and the effective date of such price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event programming, all promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms and in the case of telephone orders, a grantee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to potential customers before the order is accepted. 
(d)  Where required, advance notice for interruptions of service must be given by 1 or more of the following means: subscriber's invoice (or a separate written document included therewith), newspaper, messages on the cable system, screen crawl, door hanger. Written notice of changes in rates, programming services or channel positions must be given by 2 or more of the means specified in the preceding sentence. 
(8)  Billing. 
(a)  Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and premium service charges and equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, and credits. 
(b)  Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued promptly, but no later than the later of (i) the subscriber's next billing cycle, or 45 days, following resolution of the refund request, whichever is earlier; or (ii) the return of all equipment supplied by the grantee, if service is terminated. 
(c)  Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next available billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(d)  A grantee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(e)  A grantee's billing statement must show a specific payment due date not earlier than the midpoint of the period for which the service being billed is rendered (e.g., the fifteenth day of a 30-day billing cycle). The grantee's statement must be mailed at least 15 days before the due date. Any balance not received by 12 days after the end of the period for which the service being billed is rendered may be assessed a late fee not exceeding $5.00 in 2002 dollars (adjusted for inflation according to the Federal Bur eau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for the Greater Detroit area), or such other amount as the city and the grantee may agree, consistent with state and local law. The late fee shall appear on the following month's billing statement. 
(f)  A grantee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit payment in person at the grantee's local business office and inform the subscriber of the address of that office, provided however, that such notice need not be on the subscriber's bill.

(h)  The account of any subscriber shall be credited a prorated share of the monthly charge (not less than 24 hours' credit) for the service upon the subscriber's reasonably prompt request, if said subscriber is without service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for a period exceeding 4 hours during any 24-hour period, except where it can be documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment which that subscriber caused, or in the case of a planned outage occurring between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of which the subscriber had prior notice. 
(9)  Disconnections and downgrades. 
(a)  A subscriber may request disconnection of service at any time. 
(b)  A grantee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any subscriber upon request. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers by any grantee. So long as the subscriber returns, or permits the grantee to retrieve, any equipment necessary to receive a service within 5 business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any grantee for any cable service delivered after the date of the disconnect request. 
(c)  A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a grantee's equipment and return it to the business office. 
(d)  Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises equipment provided by the grantee has been recovered by the grantee without damage caused by the subscriber other than normal wear and tear and after any amounts otherwise due grantee have been paid. The refund must be made within 45 days from the date disconnection was requested (or, if later, the date on which any customer premises equipment provided by the grantee is returned). If a subscriber declines to return a grantee's subscriber premises equipment and return it to the grantee's business office pursuant to paragraph (d), the grantee may offset against that subscriber's refund the grantee's actual cost of retrieving the equipment, although such offset may not exceed the amount of the refund. 
(e)  If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or charge, a grantee may disconnect the subscriber's service; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until after 45 days from the beginning of the period for which the service being billed is rendered, plus at least 10 days' advance written notice to the subscriber in question of intent to disconnect, given after the 45 days have elapsed. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the grantee shall not disconnect service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the grantee shall promptly reinstate service. Grantee shall not be required to reconnect service, however, where the subscriber or household in question has a history of non-payment or where the subscriber has otherwise abused the service that has been provided. 
(f)  A grantee may disconnect a subscriber on the date specified in the notice of disconnection or within a reasonable time thereafter. 
(g)  A grantee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the grantee's cable system or equipment. After disconnection, the grantee shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the grantee for damage to its cable system or equipment. If the subscriber repeats the same or a similar activity, grantee shall have the right to permanently disconnect service to that subscriber or household. 
(h)  A grantee may disconnect a subscriber without notice where signal leakage is detected originating from the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits, provided that the grantee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber. 
(i)  A grantee shall use its best efforts to remove its property from a subscriber's premises within 30 days of the termination of service. This provision shall not apply to cable home wiring, treatment of which is governed by section 2:125. 
(j)  Subject to the provisions of this section 2:126(9), a grantee shall reconnect service to customers wishing restoration of service, provided such a customer shall first satisfy any previous obligations owed. 
(k)  A grantee shall on request provide the city's cable office its updated procedures and policies for discontinuance of cable service. 
(10)  Changes in service. 
(a)  No charge may be made for any service or product that the subscriber has not affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. Payment of the regular monthly bill does not in and of itself constitute such an affirmative indication until a reasonable time has passed. 
(11)  Parental control option. A grantee shall make available to any subscribers upon request and the payment of a reasonable fee the option of blocking the video or audio portion of any channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber's home. The control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon thereafter. 
(12)  Enforcement. 
(a)  A grantee shall keep such records as are necessary to show compliance with these customer service standards and FCC customer service standards. 
(b)  Upon the city's request, a grantee shall file with the city a statement signed by an officer or employee certifying compliance, to the best of the grantee's knowledge, with these customer service standards and FCC customer service standards for the preceding calendar quarter. If a grantee is unable to certify full compliance for that calendar quarter, it must indicate in its filing each standard with which it is in compliance, and in non-compliance; the reason for the non-compliance; and a remedial plan. 
(c)  A grantee that fails to file a compliance certificate or noncompliance statement as required herein shall be liable for the penalty specified for violation of customer service standards herein. 
(d)  In addition, except as prohibited by federal law, a grantee shall be subject to penalties, forfeitures and any other remedies or sanctions available under federal, state or local law, including without limitation this chapter and a grantee's franchise with the city, if it fails to comply with the standards herein. 
(13)  Exclusive contracts and anticompetitive acts. 
(a)  No grantee shall demand the exclusive right to serve a person or location as a condition of extending service. This provision shall not prohibit voluntary exclusive agreements to provide cable service. 
(b)  No grantee shall engage in acts that have the purpose or effect of limiting competition for the provision of cable service or services similar to cable service in the city, except that actions the grantee can show to be lawful under federal or state law shall not violate this paragraph.

(a)  Materially breaches any material provision of this franchise or fails to promptly and fully comply with any rule, order, or written request of the city, Council or the commission lawfully made pursuant to this franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a grantee shall have 30 days after written notice from the city in which to cure such default, or, if the default is of such a nature it cannot be reasonable cured within 30 days, then the grantee shall have a reasonable period of time to cure such default if it commences curing within 30 days and proceeds diligently thereafter. 
(b)  Engages in fraud, deceit or deception upon the city. 
(2)  Such termination or cancellation shall be by action of the Council to take effect after 60 days notice to the grantee and shall in no way affect any of the city's rights under this franchise or any provisions of law. In the event that such termination and cancellation depends upon a finding of fact, such finding of fact as shall be made by the Council shall be conclusive. 
(3)  A grantee, upon written request, shall be provided a full hearing before the Council prior to termination or cancellation. A grantee's failure to request a hearing prior to the expiration of the 60-day period shall constitute a waiver of its right to a hearing. 
(4)  Upon cancellation, rescission or termination of its franchise, a grantee shall have no rights whatsoever to operate a cable system in the city, nor shall it have any residual rights to assign, convey or transfer the franchise, except that upon cancellation, rescission or termination of the franchise, such grantee shall obtain a purchaser acceptable to the city pursuant to this section as a grantee and sell and transfer the same and all of the system's assets to such purchaser for an amount not exceeding fair market value. However, the city reserves the right to reject any proposed grantee it feels is unqualified and to amend any or all of the franchise terms as it reasonably finds appropriate for such new grantee. The grantee shall obtain such a purchaser, the city shall accept or reject it, and the transfer of the franchise shall occur pursuant to section 2:124, within the 24-month period specified in section 2:120(7)(a). 
(5)  Termination on account of certain assignments or appointments.

Provided, however, that a franchise may be reinstated at the city's sole discretion if, within that 120-day period: 
(i)  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
(ii)  Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, and such other conditions as may be established or as are required by applicable law. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a grantee, the city may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before the City Council, by serving notice on the grantee and the successful bidder, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless: 
(i)  The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and 
(ii)  The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, and such other conditions as may be established or as are required pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement. 
(6)  Should the city, upon termination of the franchise, desire to purchase the cable system of a grantee, and should the city and grantee be unable to agree upon a fair market value or equitable purchase price pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 547, either party may require that the dispute be submitted to an arbitrator chosen by the parties, which arbitrator shall be selected from a list provided by the American Arbitration Association if the parties do not agree upon another individual. Any arbitration award hereunder shall be enforceable in the circuit court for Washtenaw County, Michigan. 
(7)  The city may require a former grantee to remove any facilities and equipment installed pursuant to its franchise at the former grantee's expense and to restore affected sites as required herein, or the city may permit the former grantee to abandon such facilities in place. If the former grantee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former grantee's and/or surety's expense.

2:200. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Stormwater System Ordinance" of the City of Ann Arbor. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:201. - Purpose. 
    This chapter establishes a stormwater utility for the purpose of conducting the city's stormwater management program to protect public health, safety, and welfare; provides for the proportional allocation to property owners of the necessary costs of the stormwater utility; permits the establishment and collection of just and equitable rates and charges to fund the stormwater utility; provides for credits, adjustments, exemptions and appeals; establishes regulations for the use of the stormwater system, and prescribes the powers and duties of certain municipal agencies, departments and officials. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:202. - Findings. 
    The City Council finds all of the following: 
(1)  The constitution and laws of the State of Michigan authorize local units of government to provide stormwater management services and systems that will contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and to the protection of the state's natural resources. 
(2)  Property owners influence the quantity, character and quality of stormwater from their property in relation to the nature of the alterations made to property. 
(3)  Stormwater contributes to the diminution of water quality, adversely impacting the public health, safety and welfare, and endangering natural resources. 
(4)  Control of the quantity and quality of stormwater from developed and undeveloped property is essential to protect and improve the quality of surface waters and groundwaters, thereby protecting natural resources and public health, safety and welfare. 
(5)  The Federal Clean Water Act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder place increased mandates on the city to develop, implement, conduct and make available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality, velocity, and volume impacts of stormwater. 
(6)  Water quality is improved by stormwater management measures that control the quantity or quality, or both, of stormwater discharging directly or indirectly to receiving waters, that reduce the velocity of stormwater, or that divert stormwater from sanitary sewer systems. 
(7)  The city, having a responsibility to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, has a major role in ensuring appropriate water quality related to stormwater flow. 
(8)  Improper management of stormwater runoff causes erosion of lands, threatens businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage from flooding, adversely impact public health, safety, and welfare, and creates environmental damage to rivers, streams and other bodies of water in Michigan, including the Great Lakes. 
(9)  The public health, safety, and welfare is adversely affected by poor ambient water quality and flooding that results from inadequate management of both the quality and quantity of stormwater. 
(10)  It is appropriate for the city to establish user charges, fees, or rates to offset entirely or in part the cost of its stormwater management program. 
(11)  It is in the interest of protecting both the waters of the state from pollution and the public health, safety, and welfare for the city to fund stormwater management with a charge that allocates the costs of these services to property owners within the city based upon the extent to which each parcel of real property contributes to the need for stormwater management.

(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:205. - Stormwater management plan. 
    The administrator may adopt, amend, or extend a stormwater management plan from time to time. Any such adoption, amendment, or extension shall be approved by resolution of the Council. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:206. - Stormwater utility charges, general. 
(1)  Subject to the provisions of this chapter, all owners of property in the City of Ann Arbor shall be charged stormwater utility charges for their use of the stormwater system. The stormwater utility charges shall be proportionate to the necessary cost of the stormwater management services provided to each property in the city. The basis for stormwater utility charges shall be computed by the administrator. 
(2)  The stormwater utility charges shall be a quarterly or a regular interval service charge, shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter, and may be changed from time to time by Council. 
(3)  Revenue from the stormwater utility charge shall be used solely to defray the city's cost of conducting the stormwater management program defined in section 2.204 and described in the stormwater management plan prepared according to criteria in section 2:205. 
(4)  Stormwater utility charges are in addition to any special assessment, single lot assessment or public improvement charge that might be or become due for capital improvements to the stormwater system. Special assessments, single lot assessments and public improvement charges for improvements to the stormwater system that are financed in whole or in part by special assessments, single lot assessments or public improvement charges will be calculated and imposed as provided in Chapters 12 and 13. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:207. - Customer charge.

(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:208. - Stormwater discharge rate. 
(1)  Each property discharging stormwater into the city's stormwater system, either directly or indirectly, shall be charged an amount proportionate to the representative quantity of stormwater generated by that property. The principal stormwater generating characteristic of each property is its representative impervious area, which shall be used as the basis for the stormwater discharge rate. The stormwater discharge rate shall be used to fund those elements of the stormwater management program whose cost is directly related to the amount of stormwater managed. 
(2)  The representative impervious area of a property shall be the measured impervious area of the property except for single-family and 2-family residential properties or properties considered residential for storm and sanitary, which may be grouped into 1 or more representative impervious area rate categories based upon a statistical evaluation of the measured impervious area of a sample of all properties. Each property within a category shall be billed the same stormwater utility charge if such statistical similarity is demonstrated. 
(3)  The administrator may periodically change the representative impervious area of a property based upon information available to the city and/or provided by a property owner. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:209. - Charges for non-stormwater discharges. 
    The administrator may impose fees for the use of the stormwater system for non-stormwater discharges permitted by the city under section 2.216 of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:210. - Other charges. 
    Charges for other services provided by the city shall be on a time and materials basis, including direct and indirect costs, as established by the administrator. The administrator may also set charges for the fair share recovery of the cost, including direct and indirect costs, from users for the implementation and operation of any of the following: 
(a)  Monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures; 
(b)  Reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(c)  Discharge permit applications for stormwater and non-stormwater; 
(d)  Annual charges for multi-year permits, and 
(e)  Other charges as the administrator may deem necessary to carry out the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:211. - Credits. 
(1)  The purpose of this section is to provide for each property owner's control over contributions of storm flows to the stormwater utility system and the related stormwater utility charges and to advance protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(2)  The city shall offer credits that will enable any property owner, through voluntary action, to reduce the stormwater utility charges calculated for that property owner's property and will provide a meaningful reduction in the cost of service to the stormwater system, or that shall be reasonably related to a benefit to the stormwater system: 
(a)  Credits will only be applied if requirements outlined in this Code are met, including, but not limited to: completion of on-going maintenance, guaranteed right-of-entry for inspections, and submittal of annual self-certification reports. 
(b)  Credits will be defined as either set charge reduction or percent (%) reductions applied as a credit adjustment to the charge calculation equation. 
(c)  Credits are additive for each credit category. 
(d)  As long as the stormwater facilities or management practices are functioning as approved, the credit reduction will be applied to the charge. If the approved practice is not functioning as approved or is terminated, the credit reduction will be cancelled and the charge will return to the baseline calculation. Once the credit reduction has been cancelled, a customer may not reapply for credit for a period of 12 months and only then if the deficiency has been corrected, as determined by city inspection. 
(e)  Credits will be applied to the next complete billing cycle after the application has been approved. 
(3)  The administrator shall define a method for applying and granting credits, as well as criteria for determining the credits a property owner may receive. The administrator may by regulation establish credits for 1 or more of the following property owner actions: 
(a)  Installation and maintenance of a stormwater control facility meeting the design standards referenced in Chapter 55; 
(b)  Installation and maintenance of rain barrels, rain gardens, cisterns, dry wells, bioswales, and other water quality controls in addition to those required of the property owner under Chapter 55; 
(c)  Property owners that satisfy the requirements of the RiverSafe Homes or the Partners for Clean Streams programs administered by the Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner; 
(d)  Providing a school-based education or information program which has obtained MDEQ approval related to stormwater management and its impacts; and 
(e)  Other actions of the property owner that, in the judgment of the administrator, result in a measurable reduction in stormwater runoff or pollutant loadings. 
(4)  The administrator shall define criteria for determining additional credits that lands dedicated for public use may receive. Such credits are appropriate because most of the city's drainage system lies within public rights of way, sharing that property with public roads and other public and private utility systems. Public roads and other impervious surfaces within these rights of way discharge stormwater to the stormwater system and are subject to stormwater utility charges like every other property within the city. Lands dedicated for public use are eligible for credits if they provide 1 or more of the following services to the stormwater utility: 
(a)  Use of the roadway for conveyance and storage of stormwater during major storm events that exceed the capacity of the underground storm drainage system. 
(b)  Use of right-of-way for retrofit of stormwater quality control systems required under NPDES permits issued to the city. 
(c)  Access to the stormwater system for operation and maintenance activities, often restricting traffic on the roadway. 
(d)  Reduced pavement life when stormwater system repairs require open cut excavation of the roadway. 
(e)  Education provided by storm inlet labeling, stream crossing signage, and other educational signs placed within the right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07; Ord. No. 18-09, § 7, 7-16-18) 
2:212. - Exemptions. 
    Except as provided in this section, no public or private property located in a stormwater district shall be exempt from stormwater utility charges. 
(1)  Properties that do not utilize the public stormwater system shall be exempt from the portion of the charge for stormwater discharge if the property owner follows the procedure detailed by the administrator to qualify for such an exemption. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:213. - Billing. 
    The city shall bill property owners and authorized tenants for stormwater systems on a periodic basis under procedures defined in Chapter 29 and by regulations promulgated by the administrator. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:214. - Stormwater enterprise fund. 
(1)  All revenues raised from stormwater utility rates, fees, and charges shall be placed in a stormwater enterprise fund together with such other revenues from any source or combinations of sources of revenues otherwise legally available which have been designated to be used for the stormwater management program. 
(2)  No part of the funds held in the stormwater enterprise fund may be transferred to the general operating fund or used for any purpose other than undertaking the stormwater management program, and operating and maintaining a stormwater system. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:215. - Use of stormwater system. 
(1)  The primary use of the stormwater collection system shall be the collection and transportation of stormwater. Non-stormwater use shall be considered a secondary use of the stormwater system. 
(2)  The discharge of non-stormwater to the stormwater system is prohibited except as allowed under this section.

Approval by City Council must be conditioned upon the discharge meeting all criteria for discharge under this chapter. Approval conditions may provide for measures appropriate to preventing harm due to possible exfiltration into the ground adjacent to the system or failure of any pretreatment system for the discharge. 
(Ord. No. 17-07, § 2, 7-2-07) 
2:216. - Discharge permits. 
(1)  A permit is required from the administrator to discharge treated non-stormwater otherwise subject to a discharge prohibition under this chapter into the stormwater system. The administrator may require each person or firm that applies for use or uses of the stormwater system for non-stormwater purposes to obtain a discharge permit on the form prescribed by the administrator, to be subject to all provisions of this chapter. A permit may be issued for a period not to exceed 5 years. The permit shall be subject to modification or revocation for failure to comply or provide safe access or provide accurate reports of the discharge constituents and characteristics. Permits are issued to specific persons or firms for specific operations and are not assignable to another person or firm without the prior written approval of the administrator. Permits are not transferable to another location. Anyone seeking a permit to discharge treated non-stormwater otherwise subject to a discharge prohibition into the stormwater system must do the following: 
(a)  File a written statement with the administrator setting forth the nature of the enterprise, the amount of water to be discharged with its present or expected bacterial, physical, chemical, radioactive or other pertinent characteristics; 
(b)  Provide a plan map of the building, works or complex with each outfall to the surface waters, sanitary system, storm sewer, natural watercourse or ground waters noted, described and the discharge stream identified; and

(b)  To the extent grantee participates in wholesale settlements with other suppliers and/or a pool, its total supply from renewable sources shall include its pro rata share of renewable supplies provided to the pool and/or the settlement process and supplied to customers in the city from the pool and/or the settlement process. 
(c)  Upon request from the city, grantee shall provide the city with a list of plants or other facilities from which it obtained electric energy, whether directly or through a wholesale settlement or pool, and for each plant and facility listed, shall provide documentation verifying the amount and the fuel source(s) of the kWh generated. 
(d)  Verification and certification of the renewable energy sales percentages of grantee will be done by an independent third party which is in the business of certifying purchases of energy from renewable energy sources.

Any such additional power from renewable sources purchased by customers shall not be included as power from renewable sources in the calculation required by section 2:648(3), but shall be included in the calculation as part of the total power supplied to customers. 
(9)  Because the city is committed to reducing global warming emissions, any power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor after the effective date of the franchise granted by sections 2:635-2:657 must not result in an increase in CO 2 emissions. For purposes of this subsection 2:648(9), grantee shall be in compliance if the average annual CO 2 emissions from the generation mix of power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor does not exceed 1,963 lbs./MWh. Grantee's computation and methodology for computing its average annual CO 2 emissions from the generation mix of power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor during the preceding calendar year shall be included in the annual performance report required by section 2:651. 
(10)  False reporting of the information required or requested by this section 2:648 shall be grounds for termination of the franchise granted by sections 2:635-2:657.

(a)  The foregoing amount may be paid as a single payment during the first year of the franchise, or may be paid in 5 installments of $1,000.00 each during the term of the franchise granted by these sections 2:635-2:657; provided, however, that at the end of each year of the franchise, if 0.12% of the aggregate gross revenues received by the Grantee for the provision of electrical services within the city during that year exceeds $1,000.00, then grantee shall, within 90 days after the end of the year, pay into the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund the difference between $1,000.00 and the amount calculated as 0.12% of the aggregate gross revenues received by the grantee for the provision of electrical services within the city during the year. For purposes of this section 2:650(2)(a), the end of each year shall be the day immediately preceding the same day of the same month of each year as the effective date of the franchise, as set by section 2:657(1).

Each subsequent installment shall be paid on or before the same day of the same month that the first installment was due in each of the following 4years during the term of the franchise granted by these sections 2:635-2:657. 
(d)  In the event the franchise granted by these sections 2:635-2:657 is terminated earlier than the (5-year term set by section 2:636, any remaining installments which have not yet been paid shall be set at $1,000.00 each and shall become immediately due and grantee agrees that it will pay the total amount of such installments within 30 days following notice of termination of the franchise granted by these sections 2:635-2:657. 
(e)  In the event that a payment is not paid when due, interest will be added to the unpaid amount until paid in full, with interest calculated at a rate equal to 9% per annum. Acceptance of payment under this subsection shall not limit or inhibit any other right of the city. 
(3)  The City Administrator or designee and a designated representative of grantee will establish procedures for the method of transmitting grantee's contribution to the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund, including verification of the aggregate gross revenues received by the grantee during the preceding year and determination of the amount of any overpayments or underpayments due to subsequent corrections in the grantee's books of account. 
(4)  If the Michigan Public Service Commission or successor state agency with similar jurisdiction prescribes a tariff for electric energy available to extremely low income customers in Michigan, or in the City of Ann Arbor, and if grantee supplies electric service to residential customers, grantee shall offer a rate for service to such extremely low income customers that is no greater than the state-approved tariff, but which may be less to meet the goal of universal affordable electric service in the City of Ann Arbor. 
(5)  The payment by grantee to the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund under this section 2:650 is not, and shall not be construed as, a periodic franchise fee for any purpose.

(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:673. - Portfolio of renewable energy sources; option to purchase greater percentage of power from renewable energy sources; prohibition against degradation of quality of energy sources. 
(1)  During the first year of the 5-year term of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682, grantee will obtain at least 3% of the electricity (expressed in kWh) supplied to customers in the city from sources which are non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Excess kWh may be banked for use in the year next following the year in which they are generated. 
(2)  During the second year of the 5-year term of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682, grantee will obtain at least 4% of the electricity (expressed in kWh) supplied to customers in the city from sources which are non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Excess kWh may be banked for use in the year next following the year in which they are generated. 
(3)  During the third year of the 5-year term of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682, grantee will obtain at least 6% of the electricity (expressed in kWh) supplied to customers in the city from sources which are non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Excess kWh may be banked for use in the year next following the year in which they are generated. 
(4)  During the fourth year of the 5-year term of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682, grantee will obtain at least 8% of the electricity (expressed in kWh) supplied to customers in the city from sources which are non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Excess kWh may be banked for use in the year next following the year in which they are generated. 
(5)  During the fifth year of the 5-year term of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682, grantee will obtain at least 10% of the electricity (expressed in kWh) supplied to customers in the city from sources which are non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, electricity produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Excess kWh may be banked for use in the year next following the year in which they are generated. 
(6)  If grantee fails or is unable to meet the requirements of subsections 2:673(1) through (5), it shall make payment in the amount of $.015 for each kWh grantee is short of its requirement to a 501(c)(3) or other similarly designated non-profit entity whose mission statement shall include the receipt and distribution of monies dedicated to promoting energy efficiency and energy education projects in Ann Arbor. Selection of the entity shall be subject to the approval of the City Administrator or his or her designee. Measurement of grantee's provision of energy from renewable sources shall be done on a calendar year basis. Payment under this section 2:673(2) shall be made on or before March 31 following the end of the calendar year for which the calculation is made. In the event that a payment is not paid when due, interest will be added to the unpaid amount until paid in full, with interest calculated at a rate equal to 9% per annum. Acceptance of payment under this subsection shall not limit or inhibit any other right of the city. 
(7)  Definition and verification of renewable source requirement. 
(a)  For purposes of this section 2:673, the percentage of electricity from renewable sources supplied to customers in the city shall mean the ratio of the electric energy from renewable resources supplied by or under contract to customers within the city, measured in kWh, to the total electric energy supplied by grantee by or under contract to customers in the city, measured in kWh. 
(b)  To the extent grantee participates in wholesale settlements with other suppliers and/or a pool, its total supply from renewable sources shall include its pro rata share of renewable supplies provided to the pool and/or the settlement process and supplied to customers in the city from the pool and/or the settlement process. 
(c)  Upon request from the city, grantee shall provide the city with a list of plants or other facilities from which it obtained electric energy, whether directly or through a wholesale settlement or pool, and for each plant and facility listed, shall provide documentation verifying the amount and the fuel source(s) of the kWh generated. 
(d)  Verification and certification of the renewable energy sales percentages of grantee will be done by an independent third party which is in the business of certifying purchases of energy from renewable energy sources. Selection of the third party will be subject to the approval of the city. Grantee will pay for the services of the third party. 
(8)  Grantee shall offer to all its customers in the city the option to purchase a portion of their power greater than the percentages required by subsections 2:673(1) through (5) as power which is non-nuclear and non-fossil fuel based power, but which is, instead, power produced by renewable energy sources such as, and not limited to, solar, wind, hydro, or biomass energy sources. Any such additional power from renewable sources purchased by customers shall not be included as power from renewable sources in the calculation required by section 2:673(3), but shall be included in the calculation as part of the total power supplied to customers. 
(9)  Because the city is committed to reducing global warming emissions, any power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor after the effective date of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682 must not result in an increase in CO 2 emissions. For purposes of this subsection 2:673(9), grantee shall be in compliance if the average annual CO 2 emissions from the generation mix of power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor does not exceed 1,963 lbs./MWh. Grantee's computation and methodology for computing its average annual CO 2 emissions from the generation mix of power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor during the preceding calendar year shall be included in the annual performance report required by section 2:676. 
(10)  False reporting of the information required or requested by this section 2:673 shall be grounds for termination of the franchise granted by sections 2:660-2:682. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:674. - Cooperation with the city for the city's energy plan. 
    Grantee agrees to cooperate with the city to advance the goals of the Ann Arbor Energy Plan and of the Energy Commission of the City of Ann Arbor by participating in projects and programs mutually agreed upon by grantee and the city. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:675. - Extremely low income customers; contribution to Ann Arbor Assistance Fund. 
(1)  For purposes of this section 2:675, "extremely low income" is defined as 30% of median income, for the number of persons in the family unit. 
(2)  Grantee agrees to contribute to the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund a payment of 0.12% of grantee's aggregate gross revenues received for the provision of electrical services within the city during the term of the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682, or $5,000.00, whichever amount is greater. 
(a)  The foregoing amount may be paid as a single payment during the first year of the franchise, or may be paid in 5 installments of $1,000.00 each during the term of the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682; provided, however, that at the end of each year of the franchise, if 0.12% of the aggregate gross revenues received by the grantee for the provision of electrical services within the city during that year exceeds $1,000.00, then Grantee shall, within 90 days after the end of the year, pay into the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund the difference between $1,000.00 and the amount calculated as 0.12% of the aggregate gross revenues received by the grantee for the provision of electrical services within the city during the year. For purposes of this section 2:675(2)(a), the end of each year shall be the day immediately preceding the same day of the same month of each year as the effective date of the franchise, as set by section 2:682(1). 
(b)  Payment of the single payment during the first year shall be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the franchise, as set by section 2:682(1). 
(c)  Payment of the first installment under this section 2:675 shall be made on or before within 30 days after the effective date of the franchise, as set by section 2:682(1). Each subsequent installment shall be paid on or before the same day of the same month that the first installment was due in each of the following f4 years during the term of the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682. 
(d)  In the event the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 is terminated earlier than the 5-year term set by section 2:661, any remaining installments which have not yet been paid shall be set at $1,000.00 each and shall become immediately due and grantee agrees that it will pay the total amount of such installments within 30 days following notice of termination of the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682. 
(e)  In the event that a payment is not paid when due, interest will be added to the unpaid amount until paid in full, with interest calculated at a rate equal to 9% per annum. Acceptance of payment under this subsection shall not limit or inhibit any other right of the city. 
(3)  The City Administrator or designee and a designated representative of grantee will establish procedures for the method of transmitting grantee's contribution to the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund, including verification of the aggregate gross revenues received by the grantee during the preceding year and determination of the amount of any overpayments or underpayments due to subsequent corrections in the grantee's books of account. 
(4)  If the Michigan Public Service Commission or successor State agency with similar jurisdiction prescribes a tariff for electric energy available to extremely low income customers in Michigan, or in the City of Ann Arbor, and if grantee supplies electric service to residential customers, Grantee shall offer a rate for service to such extremely low income customers that is no greater than the state-approved tariff, but which may be less to meet the goal of universal affordable electric service in the City of Ann Arbor. 
(5)  The payment by grantee to the Ann Arbor Assistance Fund under this section 2:675 is not, and shall not be construed as, a periodic franchise fee for any purpose. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:676. - Annual performance report. 
    On or before March 31 of each year, grantee shall submit to the city's Energy Office an annual report which describes Grantee's activity in the city for the preceding calendar year (January 1-December 31). The report must include the following information: 
(1)  Total energy sales quantities, revenues and number of customers, separated into industrial, commercial and residential classes; 
(2)  Resource portfolio and emissions characteristics associated with energy supplied to customers in the city during the preceding calendar year, including information on the fuel mix and emissions characteristics associated with the grantee's load-serving resource portfolio; 
(3)  Grantee's computation and methodology for computing its average annual CO 2 , SO 2 and NOx emissions from the generation mix of power sold by grantee to customers in Ann Arbor during the preceding calendar year.

2:677. - Successors and assigns. 
(1)  The grantee may not sell, assign, sublet, or allow another to use the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 unless the City Council consents to same. If the grantee proposes to transfer or assign any interest of this franchise, written application for such transfer or assignment shall first be made to the city. The city may consider the technical, financial and fiscal capabilities, as well as the business history and any other information it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate in evaluating the ability of any prospective successor, assignee or transferee to undertake the requirements of this franchise. The City Council will not unreasonably withhold approval after review. 
(2)  Subject to the provisions of the City Charter and section 2:677(1), the words "DTE Energy Marketing, Inc." and "grantee", are intended and shall be held and construed to mean and include both DTE Energy Marketing, Inc., and its successors and assigns, as approved in writing by the city, whether so expressed or not. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:678. - Annual or periodic fees. 
    Grantee agrees to abide by any future ordinance(s) of the city, if and when formally adopted and effective, which may require the payment by grantee of a fee, charge or other payment on a periodic basis (such as monthly, quarterly, annually), provided that any such future ordinance(s) apply equally to all electric utility franchise holders whose franchises exclude a franchise to construct, lay, maintain or operate facilities, including but not limited to electric lines, towers, masts, poles, crossarms, guys, braces, feeders, transmission and distribution wires, transformers and other electrical appliances in, along, over or under the highways, streets, alleys, and other public places in the City of Ann Arbor, Washtenaw County, Michigan; and who supply electricity and electrical services solely through facilities presently owned and maintained by the Detroit Edison Company, by agreement with the Detroit Edison Company or as otherwise provided by law. The city shall notify grantee in writing within 45 days after the effective date of such an ordinance, at which time the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 shall be automatically amended to include the requirement that grantee make such periodic payments unless grantee, within 30 days after such notice unless grantee notifies the city in writing that it will not make the payments, in which case the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 shall be automatically revoked. Any new franchise granted to grantee by the city shall be subject to the provisions of such future ordinance(s) and shall require payment of such fee or periodic charge, or a payment substantially equivalent thereto, as a condition of the new franchise. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:679. - Franchise not retroactive. 
    The rights, powers and authority granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 are not retroactive and shall not be construed to authorize any installations or other actions of Grantee which predate the effective date of these Sections 2:660-2:682. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:680. - Notice of loss of right to use facilities. 
    If grantee terminates, forfeits, defaults or otherwise loses its right to supply electricity and electrical services through facilities presently owned and maintained by the Detroit Edison Company, then grantee shall notify the City Administrator in writing within 14 days and grantee's rights under the franchise granted by these sections 2:660-2:682 shall be suspended for 30 days following receipt of said notice. At the end of the 30 days, the franchise will be terminated unless grantee has regained its right to supply electricity and electrical services through facilities presently owned and maintained by the Detroit Edison Company and has provided the City Administrator with notice that it has regained that right. 
(Ord. No. 50-99, § 1, 1-3-00) 
2:681. - Penalties. 
    Any violation by the grantee of any provision of the franchise set forth in these sections 2:660-2:682, or any material portion thereof, shall be cause for forfeiture of this franchise and all rights hereunder to the city after written notice to Grantee and continuation of such violation, failure or default.

(5)  The City Administrator may request an applicant to submit additional information pertinent to the application and the proposed use of the public rights-of-way which the City Administrator or City Attorney deems reasonably necessary or relevant to review the application. The applicant shall comply with all such requests in compliance with reasonable deadlines for such additional information established by the City Administrator.

(6)  Within 45 days after the application is received by the City Clerk, the City Administrator shall approve or deny the request for a telecommunications permit. The City Administrator shall not unreasonably deny an application for a permit. The City Administrator shall notify the Michigan Public Service Commission when the City Administrator has granted or denied a permit, including information regarding the date on which the application was filed and the date on which permit was granted or denied. 
(7)  The City Administrator may impose conditions on the issuance of a telecommunications permit, which conditions shall be limited to the telecommunications permittee's access and usage of the public right-of-way. Without limitation, these conditions may include the posting of a bond by the telecommunications permittee in an amount that shall not exceed the reasonable cost to ensure that the public rights-of-way are returned to their original condition during and after the telecommunications permittee's access and use. A letter of credit may be provided instead of a bond if the telecommunications provider requests and the city agrees. All bonds and letters of credit shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. 
(8)  Except as otherwise explicitly provided in this chapter, the same procedures set forth in this section shall be followed by an existing telecommunications provider that applies for a telecommunications permit for telecommunications facilities already installed in the public rights-of-way, and by a telecommunications permittee that wants a new telecommunications permit because its existing telecommunications permit is expiring. 
(Ord. No. 40-02, § 2, 10-21-02) 
2:705. - Previously permitted telecommunications providers; conversion of previously issued telecommunications permits. 
    A telecommunications permit previously issued by the city to a telecommunications provider will satisfy the requirement that the telecommunications provider apply for a telecommunication permit. However, in order to bring those previously issued telecommunications permits into compliance with the requirements of the METRO Act and other applicable law, including the requirement of Section 13(4) of the METRO Act that all fees comply with Section 8 of the METRO Act, all those previously issued telecommunications permits shall be converted to either a bilateral form telecommunications permit or a unilateral form telecommunications permit under the terms of this chapter as follows: 
(1)  A previously permitted telecommunications provider that wishes to convert its existing telecommunications permit to a bilateral form telecommunications permit shall submit to the City Clerk a written request to convert its existing telecommunications permit to a bilateral form telecommunications permit, which request must received by the City Clerk on or before December 31, 2002. Provided all other terms and requirements are agreed to, the City Administrator shall then submit a bilateral telecommunications permit to the previously permitted telecommunications provider for signature and otherwise convert the existing telecommunications permit to a new bilateral form telecommunications permit upon return of the executed bilateral form telecommunications permit. 
(2)  A previously permitted telecommunications provider that wishes to convert its existing telecommunications permit to a unilateral form telecommunications permit shall submit to the City Clerk a written request to convert its existing telecommunications permit to a unilateral form telecommunications permit, which request must received by the City Clerk on or before December 31, 2002. The City Administrator shall then convert the previously permitted telecommunications provider's existing telecommunications permit to a new unilateral form telecommunications permit and issue it to the previously permitted telecommunications provider. A unilateral form telecommunications permit issued under this section shall not have a term that ends before the end of the term of the telecommunications permit previously issued to the previously permitted telecommunications provider. 
(3)  If a previously permitted telecommunications provider does not submit a request for conversion to the city on or before December 31, 2002, the City Administrator shall then issue a unilateral form telecommunications permit to the previously permitted telecommunications provider and otherwise convert the existing telecommunications permit to a new unilateral form telecommunications permit. A unilateral form telecommunications permit issued under this section shall not have a term that ends before the end of the term of the telecommunications permit previously issued to the previously permitted telecommunications provider. 
(4)  Conversion of a previously issued telecommunications permit will not relieve the telecommunications permittee of outstanding obligations under the previously issued telecommunications permit, including but not limited to the payment of fees, provision of "as-built" plans and route maps, restoration of the public rights-of-way and indemnification of the city, except to the extent that any payment of fees would violate the requirements of Section 8 of the METRO Act. 
(5)  A converted telecommunications permit shall cover all telecommunications facilities of the telecommunications permittee located in the public rights-of-way, even if those telecommunications facilities pre-dated or were otherwise not included in the telecommunications permit previously issued to the telecommunications permittee. 
(6)  The effective date of all such converted telecommunications permits shall be November 1, 2002. 
(Ord. No. 40-02, § 2, 10-21-02) 
2:706. - Annual fees. 
(1)  Effective November 1, 2002, a telecommunications permittee shall pay an annual maintenance fee to the authority in accordance with Section 8 of the METRO Act, as it may from time to time be amended. 
(2)  In compliance with the requirements of Section 13(1) of the METRO Act, the city hereby modifies, to the extent necessary, any fees charged to telecommunications providers after November 1, 2002, relating to access and usage of the public rights-of-way, to an amount not exceeding the amounts of fees and charges required under the METRO Act, which shall be paid to the authority. To the extent any fees are charged telecommunications providers in excess of the amounts permitted under the METRO Act, or which are otherwise inconsistent with the METRO Act, such imposition is hereby declared to be contrary to the city's policy and intent, and upon application by a telecommunications provider or discovery by the city, shall be promptly refunded as having been charged in error. 
(3)  The city shall not hold the grantee of a cable franchise under Chapter 32 in default or seek any remedy for its failure to satisfy an obligation, if any, to pay after November 1, 2002, a franchise fee or similar fee on that portion of gross revenues from charges the cable franchise grantee received for cable modem services provided through broadband internet transport access services.

In the event the maintenance fee provisions of the METRO Act are determined to be invalid or unconstitutional, either directly or indirectly, the city reserves the right to establish annual fees by resolution of the City Council. Annual fees established by City Council resolution may be calculated in whole or in part based on the linear footage of telecommunications facilities a telecommunications permittee has in the public rights-of-way. Regardless of how calculated, such fees shall comply with the requirements of the Michigan Telecommunications Act and METRO Act and all other applicable law.

2:707. - Term of telecommunications permit; renewal. 
(1)  A bilateral form telecommunications permit and the rights, privileges, authority and responsibilities established by such telecommunications permit shall take effect and be in force only after acceptance by the telecommunications permittee. A bilateral form telecommunications permit shall be for a term of 15 years after the date of the City Administrator's approval, subject to renewal for 3 additional 5-year periods, provided that the telecommunications permit and subsequent renewals thereof shall not take effect unless and until the telecommunications provider has filed with the city all required bonds or letters of credit, and all certificates of insurance.

(3)  A telecommunications permit shall remain in effect until the end of its term, unless terminated or revoked earlier pursuant to the terms of the telecommunications permit. 
(4)  A bilateral form telecommunications permit will automatically renew for each of 3 5-year terms unless the City Administrator notifies the telecommunications permittee in writing at least 12 months prior to the end of the term then in effect that due to changed circumstances a need exists to negotiate the subsequent renewal. In deciding whether to deny an otherwise automatic renewal of a bilateral form telecommunications permit, the city may consider the applicant's history of violations of this chapter, including but not limited to the frequency and severity of such violations, the applicant's promptness in acting to remedy violations, and the adequacy of the applicant's remedial actions, whether or not the city has sought revocation of the applicant's telecommunications permit as a consequence of any of such violations. 
(5)  A telecommunications provider that wants a new telecommunications permit following the end of the term of an existing telecommunications permit must apply for a new telecommunications permit in accordance with section 2:704.

As provided in section 2:711, a telecommunications permittee shall not be required to pay any fees to the city under Chapters 47, 49 and 50 of the City Code, but may be required to obtain bonds and insurance as may be required under Chapters 47, 49 and 50. 
(3)  This chapter does not and shall not be construed to limit the city's right to review and approve a telecommunication provider's access to and ongoing use of a public right-of-way or limit the city's authority to ensure and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. 
(4)  Every time a telecommunications permittee is issued a permit under Chapters 47, 49 or 50, or under any other provision of the City Code for installation of telecommunications facilities in the public rights-of-way, its then-existing telecommunications permit will be amended administratively to add those telecommunications facilities. All the requirements of the telecommunications permit shall apply to those new telecommunications facilities. The addition of telecommunications facilities to an existing telecommunications permit shall not change the term of the telecommunications permit.

The plans and route maps should be in the format specified in the telecommunications permit. If the Michigan Public Service Commission specifies a format for paper and/or for electronic "as-built" plans and route maps, the city's requirements in the telecommunications permit for submission of paper and/or for electronic "as-built" plans and route maps may be modified to comply with those requirements.

A telecommunications provider that undertakes an excavation or construction, installs telecommunications facilities within a public right-of-way, or temporarily obstructs a public right-of-way in the city, as authorized by a permit, shall promptly repair all damage done to the street surface and all installations under, over, below, or within the public right-of-way and shall promptly restore the public right-of-way to its preexisting condition.

Chapter 42 - OPEN SPACE AND PARKLAND PRESERVATION[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 17-04, adopted May 3, 2004, added Ch. 42 to read as herein set out. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

3:60. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Open Space and Parkland Preservation Ordinance" of the City of Ann Arbor. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04) 
3:61. - Purpose and findings 
    The purpose of this chapter is to preserve and protect open space, natural habitats, parkland and the city's source waters inside and outside the city limits for benefit of residents of the City of Ann Arbor and in cooperation with the greater Ann Arbor community. 
    The City Council finds: 
(1)  The City of Ann Arbor is a desirable place to live, work and visit in large part due to the presence of farmland and other open space lands within the city and without in the surrounding communities. 
(2)  The surrounding communities continue to experience substantial residential development pressure because of the social, cultural and education benefits of their proximity to the City of Ann Arbor and other urbanized areas of southeast Michigan. 
(3)  Uncoordinated development in the areas around Ann Arbor has affected and may continue to adversely affect the quality of life in Ann Arbor leading to fragmented open space and wildlife habitat; loss of productive farmland and forestland; destruction of rural beauty which is part of the natural historic character of the Ann Arbor community; decline in water quality and the loss of wetlands; increased auto dependency, fuel consumption, traffic congestion and air pollution; relocation of jobs to peripheral area; excessive public costs for roads and utility infrastructure, new and extensions, to dispersed development. 
(4)  The conversion of farmland, open space and wetlands to residential or other more developed uses, whether because of its greater market value as residential development property or for other business reasons, is made at the expense of a critical community resource being permanently lost to community residents. 
(5)  The City of Ann Arbor adoption of Ordinance No. 37-94, Natural Features Open Space, and Ordinance No. 49-94, Wetlands Preservation Ordinance, and related zoning and planning ordinances for the protection and preservation of open space and wetlands are not sufficient safeguards against the continuing growth and development of residential and commercial uses within and surrounding the City of Ann Arbor. 
(6)  The permanent acquisition by the City of Ann Arbor of voluntarily offered interests in farmland, open space, wetlands and other property outside the city, as provided in this chapter and as authorized by the statutes of the State of Michigan will permit these lands to remain as farmland or otherwise in their current natural state near developing urban areas and provide long-term protection for the public interest in preservation and management of the land. 
(7)  The continuation of the permanent acquisition of parkland within the City of Ann Arbor and its acquisition of farmland, open space, wetlands and other property in the surrounding communities enhances the Ann Arbor community. 
(8)  Michigan Public Act 262 of 2000 created an agricultural preservation fund with the State Treasury. Money in this fund may be used to provide grants to local units of government to assist in acquiring agricultural conservation easements provided that the local unit has adopted an ordinance for the purchase of development rights and that the local unit has a comprehensive land use plan that includes a plan for agricultural preservation. Acceptable plans for agricultural preservation can include provisions for uses that allow agriculture and open space designations that allow agriculture. 
(9)  The voters of the City of Ann Arbor have approved a charter amendment to authorize a 1/2 mill tax for 30 years to provide funds for preservation and protection of parkland, open space, natural habitats and city sourcewaters by the acquisition and management of land and land rights both within and outside the City of Ann Arbor. 
(10)  It is the policy of the City of Ann Arbor to protect, preserve and enhance farmland and open space lands through its ordinances, the authority granted it by the Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act (MCL 324.36101 et seq.), the Conservation and Historic Preservation Easement Act (MCL 324.2140 et seq.) and other state and city ordinances and the use of grants, donations and other available fund sources. 
(11)  The acquisition of land and land rights as provided in this chapter is a public purpose of the City of Ann Arbor.

These applications shall not be given any preference or priority at that time, but will be considered under the terms and conditions of this chapter along with all other applications submitted at that time. 
(6)  Owner shall be and remain subject to all ordinances, rules and regulation of the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Greenbelt District Land regardless of the transfer to and the acquisition of development rights, conservation easements or other easements in the Greenbelt District Land by the city whether now in effect or which may be subsequently adopted for the regulation of land uses or for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of residents of the jurisdiction. 
(7)  The city, its officials, employees and agents shall not be liable for any injury that may occur to any person, or for any damage that may occur to any property, as a result of any act, decision or other consequence or occurrence arising out of the acts or omission of the owner or any person or entity other than the city based on the existence of an application or the acquisition of development rights, conservation easements or other easements in Greenbelt District Land. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 23-06, § 4, 5-15-06) 
3:69. - Application procedure; approval by City Council. 
    In order for an application to be considered for purchase, it must meet the following: 
(1)  The applicant or applicants must have good, marketable, fee simple title to the Greenbelt District Land. 
(2)  The parcel of land proposed for purchase must be located within the Greenbelt District; except as provided in section 3:67. 
(3)  If a development rights purchase, the applicant or applicants must agree to maintain the land in accordance with a conservation easement approved by City Council. 
(4)  A completed application must be submitted on the approved application form by the deadline established by GAC. An owner or a duly authorized representative of the owner may apply. All applications must be signed. A separate application is required for each parcel of land offered for acquisition. GAC shall establish and publish procedures for submission and to assist owners with the application process. These procedures shall be available from the City Clerk. 
The following information shall be included in a completed application: 
a.  Adequate identification by deed reference of the parcel of land to be considered for purchase. The description should also include a map showing the location of the parcel with the Greenbelt District. 
b.  A description of the agricultural use carried out on the parcel or other current uses on the parcel. 
c.  A statement by the owner of any contingencies that the owner wishes to make GAC aware of that may affect the property in the future (such as death, estate plans, etc.). 
d.  A description of the features of the property, such as presence of water bodies, scenic views, streams, wetlands, rare species, or other desirable feature. 
e.  A statement by the owner granting access for the purpose of inspection and appraisal of the parcel by the city, its employees or contractors and GAC. 
f.  A list of any and all liens and encumbrances on the parcel. 
g.  Existence of any surface or subsurface leases or easements. 
h.  All other information requested on the application. 
    If the application is complete and the minimum criteria established are met, the application shall be evaluated. A member of GAC, authorized contractor or city staff assigned to GAC, shall view each Greenbelt District Land Application and a written report shall be made to GAC prioritizing the applications according to the established selection criteria. 
    After consideration of the written report, GAC shall determine the annual list of owners with which negotiation for purchase of land or land rights will be initiated. The determination shall be made with the goal of purchasing Greenbelt District Land, development rights and conservation easements from as many owners as possible in order to accumulate a critical mass of land to be retained for preservation and management purposes. 
    Prior to initiating formal negotiation, a title search shall be completed to determine if the owner has clear, marketable, fee simple title to the Greenbelt District Land. For purchases of development rights or conservation easements, a "before and after" qualified appraisal of the property and the interest offered for purchase shall be conducted. The qualified appraisal shall contain an analysis of the highest and best use of the parcel of land, the valuation methodology used by the appraiser to determine value, the fair market value of the full ownership of the land (excluding the buildings thereon, if any), and the value of the agricultural rights and any residential developments rights to be retained by the owner for development right purchases; or the value of all rights to be retained by the owner for conservation easement purchases. The value of the owner's retained rights or interest in the land shall be listed separately in the qualified appraisal. For purchases of land in fee simple, the qualified appraisal shall contain only the analysis of the highest and best use of the parcel of land, the valuation methodology used by the appraiser to determine value and the fair market value of the full ownership of the land (excluding the buildings thereon, if any). If appropriate, an environmental assessment, soil analysis, boundary survey or other testing may be conducted. At the conclusion of all testing and completion of the title search, a complete property analysis, including a baseline documentation of the property, and recommendation shall be prepared as to whether negotiation should continue. The owner shall be entitled to a copy of the property analysis. 
    GAC or another authorized negotiator on behalf of the city shall submit a written offer to purchase to the owner. The offer shall be for a time certain accompanied by a proposed deed of easement or title in accordance with the offer made in the application. 
    An owner may, at his or her own expense, provide additional information to GAC on the findings and determinations included in the property analysis or withdraw his or her application within 30 days of receipt of the property analysis. 
    After receipt of all information relating to an application, GAC shall forward a recommendation for acquisition to City Council for action. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 23-06, § 5, 5-15-06) 
3:70. - Related costs. 
    The costs of appraisal, engineering, surveying, planning, financial, environmental, legal or other services lawfully incurred incident to the acquisition of Greenbelt District Land or development rights, conservation easements or other easements or leasehold interest in Greenbelt District Land by the city in accordance with this chapter shall be paid by the city. The city shall not be responsible for expenses incurred by the owner incident to owner's application to or sale of Greenbelt District Land. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 23-06, § 6, 5-15-06) 
3:71. - Retained residential development rights. 
(1)  To promote "agricultural use" of properties on which the city has purchased the development rights, it has been determined that such properties should remain substantially undeveloped. 
(2)  In order to ensure environmentally responsible agricultural practices on properties which the city has purchased the development rights, such properties must conform to the USDA's Generally Accepted Agriculture Management Practices (GAAMPs) and a Conservation Plan shall be developed by the local Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) office. The conservation plan must be updated every 10 years and monitored by NRCS and the city annually. The conservation plan shall be written using current standards and specifications at the time of plan development. 
(3)  It may be in the best interest of property owners and of the program to purchase development rights that property owners retain some residential development rights so long as the land remains substantially undeveloped. When property owners retain some development rights their land value remains higher than it would be if they sold all their development rights and the value of the development rights to be purchased is correspondingly reduced. 
(4)  Conservation easements conveying development rights to the city may include a provision for a landowner to retain the right to build additional residential dwellings on the following schedule: 
0-40 acres: ..... 0 
41-80 acres: ..... 1 
81-160 acres: ..... 2 
161 and more acres: ..... 3 
    Initially, these dwellings must be owned or occupied by a direct family member or for a farm laborer with a demonstrable employment record or financial risk in the farming operation. 
(5)  Both residential and non-residential buildings must be identified in the negotiated conservation easement in order to protect other important features of the property. Building locations and lot sizes must also conform to existing zoning in the municipality where the property is located. The total impervious surface area for new and existing buildings and roads (which includes non-seasonal, permanent rooftops, concrete and asphalt) must not exceed 2% of the total easement area defined in the conservation easement granted to the city. 
(6)  A landowner may choose to omit a maximum of 2 residential building lots from the nominated property of the minimum size allowed by local zoning. GAC and City Council may consider such omission when evaluating on which properties to purchase development rights. 
(7)  Once action to select properties for the purchase of development rights has been taken by City Council, a baseline documentation report will be prepared describing through photographic, pictorial and narrative means the condition of the property at the time of the grant and a development rights easement. The baseline report shall contain a signature page where the owner and the supervisor sign to state that the report is an accurate description of the property at the time of grant. The easement shall similarly feature a page where the signatures of the owner and the Mayor are notarized, following which the easement shall be recorded with the county register of deeds so that it is effective on all current and future owners. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 23-06, § 7, 5-15-06) 
3:72. - Open space and parkland preservation fund established. 
    Revenues received for preservation and protection of open space, parkland, natural habitats and city sourcewaters through acquisition and management of Greenbelt District Land and the development rights, conservation easements and other easements on Greenbelt District Land shall be placed in a designated Open Space and Parkland Preservation Fund which is hereby created in the city budget. Revenues for the purpose of this section shall include millage funds, designated monetary gifts, unrestricted grants, and any investment income earned in the fund. 
    The fund shall be invested and managed in the same manner as existing funds of the city. No part of the fund may be transferred to any other fund, nor be encumbered, nor be utilized for any purpose except the purposes specifically set forth in this chapter. Expenditures from the fund require authorization of City Council. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04; Ord. No. 23-06, § 8, 5-15-06) 
3:73. - Duration of acquired rights; release. 
(1)  Development rights acquired pursuant to section 3.61(9) of this chapter shall be held in trust by the city for the benefit of its citizens in perpetuity. After 50 years have passed, however, the owner may make application to GAC to re-purchase the development rights. GAC shall review such application and determine whether the property has (a) become landlocked with non-agricultural uses, (b) farming is no longer feasible and (c) the release is for the public good. GAC shall evaluate the feasibility of farming by determining whether the land is no longer and never will be suitable for any kind of agriculture, with wooded land or land left fallow not necessarily to be considered unsuitable. GAC shall hold a public hearing to gain input from citizens on the application and make recommendation to City Council on the request. 
(2)  Upon receiving the recommendations of GAC, City Council shall take final action on such recommendations. Council must support the request by an owner to repurchase development rights by a 9-member majority of the total 11 members of Council. For properties 100 acres and greater, Council's 9-member majority support of the request shall result in a referendum to allow the public to decide the matter. If Council or the public supports the request, the owner shall have 1 year to complete the process of re-purchasing the rights and all associated actions. All costs associated with the request shall be borne by the applicant. 
(3)  For those properties which City Council approves the return of development rights as specified in subsection (1), GAC shall cause an appraisal of the applicant's property interest to be made at the owner's expense. Payment for this appraisal shall be made by the owner in advance. A "before and after" appraisal shall be made to determine the value of development rights. One appraisal shall determine the fair market value of full ownership of the land (excluding buildings thereon) and one shall determine the fair market value of the agricultural rights plus any specifically retained residential development rights. 
(4)  Appraisals shall be performed as required by section 1:320 of Ann Arbor City Code. The selected appraiser shall not have a property interest, personal interest or financial interest in the subject lands. In the event that the low bidder has a conflict of interest associated with a potential easement, the second low bidder will conduct that appraisal. In any event, the same appraiser shall conduct the before and after appraisals. 
(5)  Appraisals shall be in writing and shall be furnished to the respective owners for review. Errors of fact in any appraisal may be called to the attention of the appraiser by GAC or by owners of the property appraised, but corrections of the appraisal may be made only by the appraiser. 
(6)  At any time in this process, the owner may choose to withdraw the request for the return of development rights without penalty, while still being responsible for the city's appraisal of the property as specified in subsection (2) and any other costs incurred. 
(7)  If City Council approves return of development rights as specified in section 3:73(1) of this chapter, the city shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the remaining rights at the fair market value of the agricultural rights plus any retained development rights, as determined by the appraisal required in section 3:73(3) of this chapter, for the purposes of a city park or other publicly-accessible property. Upon receiving the recommendations of GAC, City Council shall take final action on such recommendations. If Council chooses to exercise this right of first refusal, an offer to purchase the remaining rights at the appraised value shall be submitted within 180 days. Acquisition of lands for public purposes shall be made with funds designated for such purchases and not with funds authorized for development rights acquisition pursuant to this chapter. The owner may at that time choose to not sell the remaining rights and instead retain ownership of the property. If Council approves the sale of development rights back to the owner, proceeds from that sale shall be placed in the Greenbelt and Open Space Acquisition Fund as specified in section 3.73 of this chapter. 
(8)  If (a) a request to re-purchase development rights is denied by City Council or the public, or (b) the landowner chooses to not sell the remaining rights when the city chooses to exercise its right of first refusal or (c) more than a year passes from Council's authorization for the re-purchase of rights, the landowner must wait 5 years before re-applying to re-purchase development rights. 
(9)  The city may convey development rights acquired pursuant to this chapter to a conservation, open space preservation, historic preservation or similar organization under terms ensuring that the public benefits for which the township purchased the development rights will be maintained. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04) 
3:74. - Enforcement. 
    City staff shall administer and enforce and the City Attorney shall prosecute this chapter and development rights and conservation easements agreements. GAC will advise and make recommendations to City Council concerning monitoring and investigation of complaints of violation of city acquired land and land rights outside of the park system. GAC shall at least once annually ascertain whether the owner is complying with all conditions of the easement or deed. Inspection findings shall be in writing and maintained. Any violation identified shall be referred to the City Attorney. 
(Ord. No. 17-04, § 1, 5-3-04) 
3:75. - Administrative costs. 
    Reasonable administrative expenses can be paid from the parks and greenbelt millage revenues for the acquisition, lease, or donation, in whole or in part, of parkland and conservation easements, land and land rights, inside and outside the city. These expenses shall not exceed the amount determined by the following formula: 
(A)  $2,000.00 for each potential acquisition or leasehold parcel approved by either the Park Advisory Commission or the Greenbelt Advisory Commission for negotiation with property owners plus 
(B)  (1)  6% of the principal amount of each series of bonds issued to finance all or part of the parks and greenbelt program ("Open Space Bonds") plus 
(2)  6% of the annual millage revenue in excess of annual debt service requirements on open space bonds; provided, that, projections of property tax valuations and millage collections over the term of the millage, which projections are approved by City Council at the time of issuance of each series of open space bonds, demonstrate than the permitted amount for administrative expenses under part B of such formula will not exceed 6% of the total millage collections over the term of the levy. 
The following activities shall be considered administration expenses that may be paid for from the millage revenues: 
 Staff or consultant time, including benefits, devoted directly to the acquisition process.

The actual cost of property or property interests, or the actual cost of lease or leasehold interests, plus charges for the items on the list to follow, can be paid from millage revenues, but are not considered administrative expenses and are not subject to the limits on the appropriation of administrative expenses. 
 Title commitments. 
 Payment of property taxes on acquired or leased property. 
 Preparation of appraisals of property. 
 Preparation of surveys of property. 
 Preparation of Phase 1 Environmental Assessments of property, as well as subsequent phases/baseline environmental studies and any related due care plan, if required.

 Any overhead charges, such as a municipal service charge. 
 Activities of the City Administrator, Mayor or City Council. 
 Activities related to city ordinances or resolutions. 
 Charges for any staff time not directly related to the purpose of this millage.

TITLE IV - STREETS AND SIDEWALKS 
Chapter 47 - STREETS 

4:1. - Application of chapter. 
    Streets regulated by this chapter include all areas defined as a "street" by section 1:8 of this Code. Where a street is owned by or under the jurisdiction of a public agency other than the city, permits specified by this chapter shall be obtained from such other public agency in accordance with any regulations it may have in effect. The use, repair, improvement or maintenance of streets by the city or its authorized agents or employees is not regulated by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76) 
4:2. - Damage and obstruction prohibited. 
(1)  No person shall make any excavation in, or cause any damage to any street in the city, except as specifically permitted by this chapter. 
(2)  No person shall place or maintain any article, thing or obstruction in any street, except as specifically permitted by this Code, but this provision shall not be deemed to prohibit such temporary obstructions as may be incidental to the expeditious movement of articles and things to and from abutting premises, nor to the lawful parking of vehicles within the part of the street reserved for vehicular traffic. 
(3)  No person shall occupy any space in a street for purposes of selling goods or services, except as specifically permitted by Chapter 31 and Chapter 79, unless said person has received a permit pursuant to this chapter. 
(4)  It is the duty of each owner of property adjacent to a street to maintain that property so that trees, shrubs and other vegetation do not obstruct the passage of vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians on streets or sidewalks. If a property owner fails to maintain the property as required by this section, the city may do the work necessary to bring the property into compliance and charge the property owner for the reasonable cost of the work. If the charges for the work are not paid, they may be assessed against the property, as provided in Section 10.4 of the City Charter. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76; Ord. No. 45-79, 9-4-79; Ord. No. 42-98, § 9, 10-5-98) 
4:3. - Permits, indemnification, bonds and insurance. 
(1)  Where permits are authorized in this chapter, they shall be obtained from the city upon submission of a completed application on forms available in the planning and development services unit and upon compliance with all other applicable requirements of this chapter. Such permit shall be revocable by the Administrator for failure to comply with this chapter, rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto, and the lawful orders of the Administrator or his duly authorized representative, and shall be valid only for the period of time endorsed thereon. 
(2)  Application for a permit under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed as agreement by the applicant to promptly complete any work permitted, observe all pertinent laws and regulations of the city in connection therewith, repair all damage done to the street surface and installations on, over or within such street, including trees, and defend, indemnify, and save harmless the city from all damages or actions at law that may arise or may be brought on account of injury to persons or property resulting from the work done or the permit holder's activities under the permit or in connection therewith. 
(3)  Where liability insurance policies are required to be filed in making application for a permit, they shall be in not less than the following amounts, except as otherwise specified in this chapter: 
(a)  On account of injury to, or death of, any person in any 1 accident: $500,000.00 
(b)  On account of damage to property in any 1 accident: $50,000.00 
    The insurance policy shall name the City of Ann Arbor as an insured party and evidence of the insurance shall consist of certification executed by an authorized agent of the insurance company indicating the amount and type of insurance, the location of coverage and it shall certify that the insurance shall not be cancelled unless notice of intent to cancel shall be filed with the planning and development services unit at least 10 days prior to said cancellation. Persons doing repairs to sidewalks, curbs and driveway approaches in the street area directly adjacent to single-family residences may comply with the insurance requirements of this chapter by showing evidence of public liability insurance for personal injuries in an amount not less than $100,000.00, which insurance need only insure the person or firm doing the repairs. 
(4)  Except as otherwise specified by resolution of the City Council; where cash deposits are required with the application for any permit hereunder, the deposit shall be in an amount to be determined by the building official as reasonably necessary to restore any public right-of-way or facilities that may be disturbed and to defray all expenses to the city arising out of the granting of the permit and work done under the permit or in connection with it. The building official shall consider restoration performance by the contractor under past and current permits when determining the amount of deposit reasonably necessary for restoration. As work under the permit is completed the building official may return portions of the deposit no longer necessary to assure payment of costs assessable against the deposit. Not later than 3 years after completion of the work done under the permit, any unencumbered balance of the cash deposit shall be refunded. In any case where the deposit does not cover all costs and expenses of the city, the deficit shall be paid by the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76; Ord. No. 57-66, 8-8-66; Ord. No. 67-76, 11-15-76; Ord. No. 46-80, 7-21-80; Ord. No. 59-95, § 1, 2-5-96; Ord. No. 17-99, § 1, 4-19-99; Ord. No. 43-04, § 19, 1-3-05) 
4:4. - Street openings. 
    Except as provided in section 4:5, no person shall make any excavation or opening in or under any street without first obtaining a written permit from the Administrator. No permit shall be granted until the applicant shall post a cash deposit and file a liability insurance policy as required by section 4:3, provided that such permits may be issued to a public utility company without the posting of a deposit if such a company has entered an agreement to be responsible for all street repairs required as a result of the street openings. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76; Ord. No. 17-99, § 1, 4-19-99)

    Openings through the sidewalk for the delivery of fuel when lawfully in existence, shall not be greater than 30 inches in diameter, shall be circular in form, and shall be effectually closed when not in actual use by an iron cover set flush within the surface of the sidewalk, level with the sidewalk, and securely locked in place. All openings in the sidewalk for the admission of light and air shall be closed and protected either by substantial iron grating or illuminating pavement of a design and so placed as to be satisfactory to the Public Services Area Administrator. 
(Ord. No. 43-04, § 19, 1-3-05) 
4:8. - Utility poles and wires. 
    Utility poles may be placed in such streets as the Administrator shall prescribe and shall be located thereon in accordance with the directions of the Administrator. Such poles shall be removed or relocated as the Administrator shall from time to time direct. New utility lines requiring a series of 3 or more poles or towers erected at new locations shall be erected only with the permission of the Building Board of Appeals. Said permission may be given if the board finds that an extreme hardship would be imposed on the affected utility or its customers if the lines were required to be placed along a different route or underground. 
    Utility wires may be installed under streets only after the plans for such installation have been approved by the Administrator. Such installation shall also be subject to regulations made by the Community Services Area Administrator, Public Services Area Administrator, or designee of either, as applicable, for the protection of trees and other landscaping. 
(Ord. No. 1-70, 6-15-80; Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76; Ord. No. 43-04, § 19, 1-3-05) 
4:9. - Maintenance of installations in street. 
    Every owner of, and every person in control of, any estate hereafter maintaining a sidewalk vault, coal hole, manhole, or any other excavation, or any post, pole, sign, awning, wire, pipe, conduit or other structure in, under, over or upon, any street which is adjacent to or a part of his estate, shall do so only on condition that such maintenance shall be considered as an agreement on his part with the city to keep the same and the covers thereof, and any gas and electric boxes and tubes thereon, in good repair and condition at all times during his ownership or control thereof, and to indemnify and save harmless the city against all damages or actions at law that may arise or be brought by reason of such excavation or structure being under, over, in or upon the street, or being unfastened, out of repair or defective during such ownership or control. 
4:10. - New paving. 
    Whenever the City Council shall determine by resolution to pave or resurface any street, the Administrator shall, not less than 30 days prior to commencement of construction, serve notice upon all public utilities, requiring them to install all necessary underground work. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76) 
4:11. - Sewer and water connections. 
    When such paving or resurfacing shall have been ordered or declared necessary by resolution of the City Council, such sewer and water connections as are necessary, shall be installed in advance of such paving or resurfacing, and the cost thereof shall be charged against the premises adjacent thereto, or to be served thereby, and against the owner of such premises. Where such paving or resurfacing is financed in whole or in part by special assessment, the cost of such sewer and water connections may be made chargeable against the premises served or adjacent thereto, as a part of the special assessment for such paving or resurfacing. Where such paving or resurfacing is financed otherwise than by special assessment, the cost of the sewer and water connections so installed, shall be a lien on said premises adjacent thereto, or to be served thereby, and shall be collected as provided for assessments on single lots pursuant to the provisions of section 1:292. 
4:12. - Determination of necessity. 
    The necessity for such sewer and water connections shall be determined by the Administrator, which determination shall be based upon the size, shape and area of each abutting lot or parcel of land, the lawful use of such land under the zoning regulations of the city, the character of the locality and the probable future development of each abutting lot or parcel of land. The Administrator shall give written notice of the intention to install such sewer and water connections and to charge the cost of the same to the premises, to each owner of land abutting the street, to be furnished with such connections, as shown by the records of the City Assessor in accordance with section 1:11 of this Code. Any owner objecting to the installation of any such sewer or water connection, shall file his objections in writing within 7 days after service of such notice, with the Administrator who shall, after considering each such objection made in writing, make a final determination of the sewer and water connections to be installed. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76) 
4:13. - Prohibited openings. 
    No permit to make any opening or excavation in or under a paved street shall be granted to any person within a period of 3 years after the completion of any paving or resurfacing thereof. If a street opening is necessary as a public safety measure or if other just cause is shown to exist, the Administrator may suspend the operation of this section, as to such street opening. 
(Ord. No. 45-75, 2-17-76; Ord. No. 29-90, § 1, 6-4-90) 
4:14. - Street and sidewalk occupancy permits.

Chapter 50 - UTILITY WIRES 

4:70. - Purpose of chapter. 
    The Council finds that utility poles, overhead utility wires and associated overhead structures are hazardous to automotive and pedestrian traffic, are dangerous in severe weather, interfere with firefighting equipment, contribute to conditions of urban blight and are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this chapter to establish a method for the orderly removal and underground relocation of said utility facilities. 
4:71. - Definitions. 
    Whenever in this chapter the words or phrases hereinafter in this section defined are used, they shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the following definitions: 
(a)  "Underground utility district" or "district" shall mean that area in the city within which poles, overhead wires, and associated overhead structures are prohibited as such area is described in a resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of section 4:73 of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 40-02, § 3, 10-21-02) 
4:72. - Public hearing by Council. 
    The Council may from time to time call public hearings to ascertain whether the public necessity, health, safety or welfare requires the removal of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures within designated areas of the city and the underground installation of wires and facilities for supplying electric, communication, or similar or associated service. The City Clerk shall notify the utilities and all affected property owners as shown on the last assessment roll by mail of the time and place of such hearings at least 10 days prior to the date thereof. Each such hearing shall be open to the public and may be continued from time to time. At each such hearing all persons interested shall be given an opportunity to be heard. The decision of the Council shall be final and conclusive. 
    Prior to calling said public hearing the Council shall obtain from the utilities estimates of the reasonable cost of converting to underground wires on each separately owned parcel within the proposed district. The notices of the public hearing shall inform each affected property owner of the estimated cost of said conversion on his property. 
4:73. - Council may designate underground utility districts by resolution. 
    If, after any such public hearing, the Council finds that the public necessity, health, safety or welfare requires such removal and such underground installation within a designated area, the Council shall, by resolution, declare such designated area an underground utility district and order such removal and underground installation. Such resolution shall include a description of the area comprising such district and shall fix the time within which such removal and underground installation shall be accomplished and within which affected property owners must be ready to receive underground service. A reasonable time shall be allowed for such removal and underground installation, having due regard for the availability of labor, materials and equipment necessary for such removal and for the installation of such underground facilities as may be occasioned thereby. 
    The Council shall not designate such a district until 60 days after the proposed district has been referred to the planning commission or until the planning commission makes its report to the Council, whichever first occurs. 
4:74. - Unlawful acts. 
    Whenever the Council creates an underground utility district and orders the removal of poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures therein as provided in section 4:73 of this chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person or utility to erect, construct, place, keep, maintain, continue, employ or operate poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures in the district after the date when said overhead facilities are required to be removed by such resolution.

(a)  Every person owning, leasing, or occupying a building or structure within a district shall be responsible for the construction of that portion of the service connection of his property between the facilities referred to in section 4:78 and the termination facility on or within said building or structure being served. Upon request of a person owning, leasing or occupying land where such underground construction is his responsibility the supplying utility shall provide said construction at a reasonable cost to the owner. If the above is not accomplished by any person within the time provided for in the resolution enacted pursuant to section 4:73 hereof, the engineer shall give notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing to the owner thereof as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, to provide the required underground facilities within 10 days after receipt of such notice. 
(b)  Said notice to provide the required underground facilities may be given either by personal service or by mail. In case of service by mail on either of such persons, the notice must be deposited in the United States mail in a sealed envelope with postage prepaid, addressed to the person in possession of such premises at such premises, and the notice must be addressed to the owner thereof as such owner's name appears, and must be addressed to such owner's last known address as the same appears on the last assessment roll, and when no address appears, to General Delivery, City of Ann Arbor. If said notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed to have been received by the person to whom it has been sent within 48 hours after the mailing thereof.

(d)  If upon the expiration of the 30-day period, the said required underground facilities have not been provided, the engineer may proceed to do the work; provided, however, if such premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished thereto, the engineer shall in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to said property. Upon completion of the work the cost of the labor and materials shall be assessed against the property in the manner provided by section 1:292 of Chapter 13 of Title I. 
4:80. - Responsibility of city. 
    The city shall remove at its own expense all city owned equipment from all poles required to be removed hereunder in ample time to enable the owner or user of such poles to remove the same within the time specified in the resolution enacted pursuant to section 4:73. 
    The city shall be obligated to the affected property owner in the amount provided by paragraphs (a) or (b) below, whichever amount is greater: 
(a)  If the cost to any affected property owner in converting utility service which existed at the time he was sent a notice of public hearing pursuant to section 4:72 should exceed by 15% the amount of the estimate contained in that notice, the city will be obligated to the affected property owner for the amount of that excess cost. 
(b)  If the cost to any affected property owner in converting utility service which existed at the time the district was created should exceed 4% of the assessed value of the property at the time of conversion, the city will be obligated to the affected property owner for the amount of that excess cost. 
4:81. - Extension of time. 
    In the event that any act required by this chapter or by a resolution adopted pursuant to section 4:73 hereof cannot be performed within the time provided, on account of shortage of materials, war, restraint by public authorities, strikes, labor disturbances, civil disobedience or any other circumstances beyond the control of the actor, then the time within which such act will be accomplished may be extended by the building board of appeals for a period equivalent to the time of such limitation. 
4:82. - Penalty. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or to fail to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. Any person violating any provision of this chapter or failing to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00.

Chapter 69 - MERCURY THERMOMETERS 

6:300. - Findings. 
    The City Council finds as follows: 
(1)  Mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that bioaccumulates in the environment and in the food chain; 
(2)  Combustion of medical, municipal and other solid waste, which contains whole or broken mercury thermometers, is a major source of atmospheric deposition of mercury resulting in mercury contamination of air and water; 
(3)  Mercury from mercury thermometers can also enter the environment, including the watersheds, rivers and lakes in and around the City of Ann Arbor, directly through vaporization and/or spillage when a thermometer breaks during use, transportation or disposal; 
(4)  The effect of mercury on the central nervous system includes tremors, impaired vision and hearing, paralysis, insomnia, emotional instability, developmental deficits during fetal development, attention deficit, and developmental delays during childhood; 
(5)  Due to the bioaccumulation of mercury in fish, the Michigan Department of Community Health has issued fish consumption advisories for every inland lake in Michigan, including lakes in Washtenaw County. The advisories recommend that the general population of adults should eat no more than 1 meal per week of many types of sport fish from these lakes and that women of childbearing age and children under age 15 should not eat more than 1 meal per month of these fish; 
(6)  Several states and cities around the world have demonstrated that removal of mercury-containing products, such as mercury thermometers, from the waste stream is an effective way to reduce mercury contamination. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, the American Hospital Association and the American Public Health Association are currently implementing programs to eliminate mercury waste; 
(7)  Mercury thermometers are not currently used or dispensed at either the University of Michigan Health System or St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, and both institutions have pledged to eliminate mercury and mercury waste in their medical practices; and 
(8)  There are accurate and safe alternatives to mercury thermometers that are readily available and comparable in cost. 
(Ord. No. 31-00, § 1, 7-10-00) 
6:301. - Definitions. 
(1)  Mercury thermometer means a mercury-containing product that is used to measure human body temperature. 
(2)  Mercury-containing product means a product, device, instrument or equipment into which elemental mercury or mercury compounds are intentionally added during its formulation or manufacture and in which the continued presence of mercury is desired to provide a specific characteristic or to permit a specific function. 
(Ord. No. 31-00, § 1, 7-10-00) 
6:302. - Retail sale prohibited. 
It  shall be unlawful for any person who owns, conducts, operates or manages a retail commercial establishment to sell or offer for retail sale any mercury thermometer in the city. 
(Ord. No. 31-00, § 1, 7-10-00) 
6:303. - Manufacturing prohibited.

Chapter 70 - MANUFACTURED FERTILIZER[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- It should be noted that Ord. No. 1-06, § 1, adopted Feb. 6, 2006, becomes effective January 1, 2007. 

6:400. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Manufactured Fertilizer Ordinance" of the City of Ann Arbor. 
(Ord. No. 1-06, § 1, 2-6-06) 
6:401. - Intent and Purpose. 
(1)  City Council finds that certain compounds containing phosphorus, which are contained in manufactured fertilizer, when used in the City of Ann Arbor, enter into the city's and neighboring communities' water resources, including wetlands and watercourses, resulting in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants which is detrimental to these resources. 
(2)  City Council finds that reduction of the use of manufactured fertilizers containing phosphorus will assist the city in reducing the amount of phosphorus that enters the city's and neighboring communities' water resources, which is required by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) limitation for the Middle Huron River and Associated Tributaries and related National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit limits pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Water Quality Planning and Management Regulations (40 C.F.R. part 130), as amended. 
(3)  City Council finds that most mature topsoil in the city has a sufficient level of phosphorus, which occurs naturally to promote adequate turf root growth. 
(4)  It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate the application of manufactured fertilizers only on turf areas and not on or in areas such as gardens, farms, or landscape amenities. 
(5)  It is the further purpose and intent of this chapter to regulate the use and application of manufactured fertilizer and manufactured fertilizer containing phosphorus, to require the registration of commercial and institutional applicators of manufactured fertilizers within the city, and to require the distribution of informational literature to consumers about the use and effect of manufactured fertilizers and manufactured fertilizers containing phosphorus.

(Ord. No. 16-18, § 1, 10-6-16) 
6:601. - Intent and Purpose. 
(1)  City Council has determined that the unnecessary operation of internal combustion engines poses a number of public health concerns. In particular, airborne pollutants from engine emissions cause or aggravate pulmonary diseases, including asthma, lung cancer, bronchitis, acute respiratory infections, and emphysema. In addition to public health concerns, idling engines also impose economic costs, including wasted energy, consumption of non-renewable resources, and business and personal expenses for medical care and loss of productivity due to pollution-related illness. Idling engines also reduce citizens' quality of life due to noise, odor, and air pollution. 
(2)  City Council has determined that unnecessary idling contributes to general environmental degradation by emitting greenhouse gases, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, and that City Council has determined that although technological refinements have mitigated some of the adverse effects of internal combustion engines, their use continues to increase and many older engines continue in service, offsetting many of the benefits of new technology. City Council recognizes that activities within Ann Arbor impact the environment both locally and regionally. 
(3)  City Council is committed to eliminating air toxins, criteria pollutants and persistent bioaccumulative toxins, as well as eliminating net greenhouse gas emissions and other destabilizing climate impacts. 
(4)  It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to regulate the operation of internal combustion engines within the City of Ann Arbor in order to protect public health and the environment, conserve energy and resources, promote economic efficiency, and improve quality of life.

(2)  The commission shall review and act upon only exterior features of a resource, and excepting for noting compliance with the requirement to install a fire alarm system or smoke alarm, shall not review and act upon interior arrangements unless specifically authorized to do so by City Council in the ordinance designating the historic district or unless interior work will cause visible change to the exterior of the resource. The commission shall not disapprove an application due to considerations not prescribed in subsection (1). 
(3)  If an application is for work that will adversely affect the exterior of a resource the commission considers valuable to the city, state, or nation, and the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purpose of the city, state, or nation, the commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
(4)  The commission shall not issue a certificate of appropriateness unless the applicant certifies in the application that the property where the work will be undertaken has, or will have before the proposed project completion date, a fire alarm system or smoke alarm complying with the requirements of the Construction Code as provided in Chapter 100.

(b)  The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing, and environmental clearances. 
(c)  Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship, and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to a vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
(d)  Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community.

8:417. - Evidence of undue financial hardship.

8:511. - Inspections. 
(1)  Periodic inspections and fees therefor. 
(a)  The Building Official shall inspect all dwelling units, except owner-occupied single-family attached and detached, and homes for the aged which are licensed by the State of Michigan, on a periodic basis. This includes city-owned public housing. For abandoned dwellings, the period between inspections shall be no longer than 3 months; for all other dwellings, except as otherwise provided in this section, the period between inspections shall be no longer than 21/2 years. Copies of the state inspection report and license for homes for the aged shall be submitted to the Building Official annually. This current information shall be retained as part of the permanent record of each such facility. Failure to submit the copy of the license shall result in the need for inspection/certification by the Planning and Development Services Unit. 
Upon determination of the Building Official that the self-inspection program of a terrace family housing cooperative meets the standards of this section, that cooperative shall be exempt from the periodic inspection provisions of this section and the certificate of occupancy provisions of section 8:516. A terrace family housing cooperative is dwellings owned by a non-profit corporation and financed pursuant to the National Housing Act, each of which is occupied by a member of the non-profit corporation pursuant to the bylaws and an occupancy agreement providing for exclusive occupancy of the units by members of such corporation. The requests for an exemption shall be accompanied by authorization for the request from the members of the corporation, wherein the membership was informed of its rights under this chapter. The cooperative shall have its own written self-inspection program, for compliance with this code, that includes: 
1.  An inspection form comparable to that used by the Building Department for identification of code violations. 
2.  Annual inspection of no less than 25% of all units with each unit inspected no less than once every 4 years. 
3.  A system for providing copies of all inspection reports, and reinspection reports, including certification of the work completed, following remedial action of any violations of the code identified during the inspection, at least annually to the Building Department. 
4.  A system for the validation by the department of the reports submitted in paragraph (3) through the inspection, at the cooperative's expense, of up to 25 of the units inspected each year which shall include a method to correct any pattern of deficiencies noted in the validation inspections. 
5.  A system for the immediate correction of any fire, safety, or health hazards. 
6.  A system of providing all members at least annually and at the time of move in with a written statement of procedures to be followed if the member has a problem with his/her unit, including a statement that the member may at any time seek and obtain an inspection by the Building Department of physical problems within the unit. 
7.  If the department concludes, after a self-inspection program has been in operation for at least 1 year, that a cooperative has failed to meet 1 or more of the requirements of 8:511(1)(a)(1) through (6), it shall notify the cooperative in writing stating the reason(s) for each of its conclusions. The cooperative shall respond to the department within 30 days of receipt of the notice by accepting or rejecting each of the conclusions. For each conclusion, the cooperative accepts, it shall indicate a time period for corrective action. If the department and the cooperative are unable to resolve the matter, it shall be submitted to the Housing Board of Appeals pursuant to section 8:515. If the board finds against the cooperative, it shall allow the cooperative 180 days to complete corrective action before concluding that the cooperative cannot continue a self-inspection program. 
8.  The decision of a cooperative to have a self-inspection program shall not preclude any member of the cooperative from requesting and obtaining an inspection of his/her unit by the department nor preclude the cooperative from requesting such inspections by the department as it deems necessary. 
9.  A self-inspection program, unless terminated by the city, may continue for a 3-year period. The cooperative shall within 6 months prior to the expiration of any 3-year period reapply, upon approval of the members for an additional 3 years. If a cooperative's participation in such a program has been terminated by either party, the cooperative may reapply at any time after 3 years from the date of termination. 
(b)  An inspection shall be conducted in the manner best calculated to secure compliance with the code and appropriate to the needs of the community. Inspections shall be on, but not be limited to, the following basis: 
1.  An area basis, such that all the regulated premises in a predetermined geographical area will be inspected simultaneously or within a short period of time. 
2.  A request basis, such that an owner applying for a certificate of compliance may request an inspection, which shall be made within a reasonable time. 
(c)  An inspection shall be carried out by the Building Official and such representatives of other services areas or units as may form a team to undertake an inspection under this and other applicable laws. 
(d)  An inspector or team of inspectors may request permission to enter all premises regulated by the code at reasonable hours to undertake an inspection. Upon an emergency, the inspector or team of inspectors shall have the right to enter at any time. An emergency shall exist for purposes of the chapter when the Building Official has reason to believe that a condition hazardous to health or safety exists requiring immediate attention. 
(e)  When a violation is found, the Building Official shall at the expiration of the time set for correcting the violation, or earlier if notified by the owner, reinspect the premises to determine whether the violation has been corrected. If such reinspection is not made, due to the action or inaction of the owner or agent, an occupant may pay his/her rent to the Building Department to be held in escrow until the reinspection is made. 
(f)  The Building Official shall charge the owner a fee for each periodic inspection and each reinspection required to correct violations. The fee for these inspections shall be established by resolution of the City Council upon the recommendation of the City Administrator. The initial inspection fee shall be paid in advance, reinspections shall be billed per the appropriate rate. Unpaid fees may be assessed against all premises in accordance with the procedures specified in section 1:292 of title I of this Code. 
(2)  Complaints. 
(a)  The Building Official shall maintain a written record of each complaint concerning a violation of the code. This record shall include the date and time the complaint was filed and the name and address of the person making the complaint. An inspection of premises for which complaints have been received will be made within 10 working days. In the course of carrying out the inspection, the inspector shall cite any violations noticed, and any additional complaints made by the resident shall be inspected. 
(b)  If a complaint is filed with the Building Official, concerning an alleged violation in a building, the Planning and Development Services Unit shall notify the owner of said complaint. If there are violations, the provisions of section 8:513 shall be applied. 
(c)  When an inspection is made upon a complaint, and it is determined that no violation exists, and that the purpose of the complaint was not harassment, no charge will be made for the inspection. 
(d)  When a violation or violations are found, the person making the inspection shall file a written report of such violation or violations with the Planning and Development Services Unit within 1 week of the inspection. 
(e)  Any person causing an inspection to be made for the sole purpose of harassing any individual, corporation, or governmental agency when no violation is actually present shall be billed twice the ordinary cost of said inspection, and could be subject to civil liability. 
(3)  Inspection authorization. 
(a)  In a non-emergency situation, a request for permission shall be made before an inspection to the owner or his agent, or to the occupant, and to both owner or agent and occupant, if both are present. If the inspection is based upon a complaint, the inspector shall try to schedule the inspection for a time when the complainant will be present. Where the owner or occupant demands a warrant for inspection of the premises, the Building Official shall obtain a warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. The Building Official shall prepare the warrant, stating the address of the building to be inspected, the nature of the inspection as defined in this code or other applicable law, and the reasons for the inspection. It shall be appropriate and sufficient to set forth the basis for inspection (e.g., complaint, area) established in this section, in other applicable codes or in rules or regulations. The warrant shall also state that it is issued pursuant to this section, and that it is for the purposes set forth in this and other codes which require that inspections be conducted. 
(b)  If the court finds that the warrant is in proper form and in accord with this section, it shall be issued forthwith. 
(c)  In the event of an emergency, no warrant shall be required. 
(4)  Policy regarding inspection. 
(a)  It is the policy of the city that the inspection procedures set forth in this code are established in the public interest, to secure the health and safety and general welfare of the occupants of dwellings and of the general public. 
(b)  The Building Official shall keep a record of all inspections and reports of violations, and the records are to be open to the public for review and copying. 
(c)  The Building Official shall make available to the general public a checklist of commonly recurring violations for use in examining premises offered for occupancy. 
(d)  The Building Official shall submit monthly reports to the City Council specifying the number of initial inspections, reinspections, and buildings certified for occupancy during the month. In addition, the report shall include the number of complaints, buildings razed, appeals heard, abandoned dwellings inspected, certificates suspended, persons using the city escrow account, and tickets issued during the month. The report shall also include notice of public hearings being held on any administrative rules, and the number of inspection reports that have not been prepared within the 10 working days. These monthly reports shall be available to the public upon request through the Planning and Development Services Unit. 
(5)  For dwellings that are determined to be in full compliance with this chapter at the first inspection of a periodic inspection, the period between that inspection and the next inspection shall be extended to 31/2 years. 
(Ord. No. 66-87, § 1, 12-21-87; Ord. No. 10-88, § 1, 5-2-88; Ord. No. 28-88, § 3, 7-18-88; Ord. No. 28-90, § 7, 6-4-90; Ord. No. 54-90, § 1, 10-15-90; Ord. No. 46-92, § 1, 6-15-92; Ord. No. 61-92, § 2, 10-5-92; Ord. No. 43-04, § 35, 1-3-05; Ord. No. 17-10, § 2, 7-3-17)

    The Building Official shall have the power as may be necessary in the interest of public safety, health and general welfare, to interpret and implement the provisions of the chapter, to secure the intent thereof, and to designate the requirements applicable. 
1.  Administrative decisions. The Building Official may administratively rule on situations where the code does not specifically provide requirements or where 2 code provisions are in conflict. Administrative decisions shall not conflict with the code provisions and shall be in keeping with the intent of the code. Where there are conflicting provisions, the provision securing the greater degree of public safety, health, and general welfare, shall be applied in that order. Copies of such decision shall be placed on file and be reported monthly to the Housing Board of Appeals for review. 
2.  Administrative rules. The Building Official may adopt rules as may be necessary to establish uniform implementation of the intent of the code. The Building Official shall hold a public hearing on proposed rules. All public comments in the hearing must be considered by the hearing official. Advance notice shall be provided in the local newspaper and mailings to appropriate organizations. These rules are intended to supplement the code where needed to properly administer the provisions of the code. Such rules shall be deemed to be as complete and binding a part of the chapter as if the same were herein specifically set forth, and the violation of any such rule so adopted shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. Copies of such rules shall be placed on file in the Planning and Development Services Unit for inspection, review, copying, and shall be approved by the Housing Board of Appeals and submitted to the City Council for confirmation. 
Before the adoption of a rule, an agency shall give notice of a public hearing and offer a person an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments. The notice shall be given not less than 15 calendar days, nor more than 30 calendar days before the public hearing. The notice shall include all of the following: 
(a)  The time and place of the public hearing and a statement of the manner in which data, views, and arguments may be submitted to the agency at other times by a person. 
(b)  A statement of the terms or substance of the proposed rule, a description of the subject and issues involved, and the proposed effective date of the rules.

8:513. - Notices and orders. 
(1)  Form of notice. Whenever the Building Official determines that there has been a violation of any provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, he shall give notice of such alleged violation and orders for correction of violation to the person or persons responsible therefor, as hereinafter provided. Such notice shall: 
(a)  Be in writing; 
(b)  Include a statement of the conditions that constitute violations of this chapter and what must be done to correct same; 
(c)  State the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, and the address of the dwelling; 
(d)  Specify a time limit for the performance of any act it requires. Said time limit shall be a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 calendar days unless: 
(i)  The work is major exterior work including but not limited to work such as painting, gutters, foundations, or roof work, weather dependent, and therefore, could not reasonably be completed within 60 calendar days based on the period of the year in which the inspection is done. In such cases, the time limit for the weather dependent work shall be 60 calendar days after a date when favorable weather conditions could be expected. All said time limits shall commence from the date of the inspection report; 
(ii)  The owner or agent intends to make substantial renovations which must be directly linked to the correction of the violation(s), and he/she applies for permits, submits required plans, and a schedule of proposed renovations as per section 8:518. 
(e)  Notify the owner or agent, the occupant, or the complainant as the case may require, of the right to appeal; 
(f)  Be served within 10 working days upon the owner or his agent, or the occupant, as the case may require, provided that such notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon such owner or agent or upon such occupant if a copy thereof is served upon him personally, or if a copy thereof is sent by certified mail to his last known address, or if he is served with such notice by any other method authorized or required under this Code or the laws of this state; 
(g)  A duplicate shall be sent to the occupant in cases where the owner or his agent are the appropriate parties to be served, and be sent to the owner or his agent in cases where the occupant is the appropriate party to be served. If the violation or violations concern a common area rather than an individual dwelling unit or rooming unit, the notice shall be sent to all occupants of the dwelling, or may also be posted in a conspicuous location in said dwelling if, in the judgment of the Building Official, such posting is necessary to provide adequate notice. If the violation is a major one, posting shall be mandatory, whether the violation concerns a common area or an individual dwelling unit or rooming unit. Any person removing such posted notice without authorization of the Building Official shall be fined $50.00. Notice to occupants by mail or posting shall be given within 10 working days after the date of inspection; 
(h)  Include a statement that any full certificate of compliance has been suspended and that rent may be paid into the escrow fund maintained by the Building Department if the repair of conditions is not made within the time limit set in the notice of violation or lawful extensions thereto, and a statement that civil actions for compelling the repairs and for damages may be available. 
(2)  Appeal when no violation found. If the inspection is based upon a complaint and it is determined upon inspection that no violation exists, the complainant may appeal said determination to the Housing Board of Appeals, and the complainant shall be notified of this right to appeal. 
(3)  Failure to complete work within the time limits specified in subsection 8:513(1)(d) shall constitute a separate violation of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 66-87, § 1, 12-21-87; Ord. No. 28-90, § 8, 6-4-90) 
8:514. - Extension of time. 
(1)  The time limit set for the correction of any violation not prohibited by subsection (3) below may be extended by the department for a reasonable time upon a showing that the person ordered to make the repair has made a good faith effort to comply with said order, and that the repair could not have been accomplished within the time originally set, or, in the case of owner-occupied 2-family dwellings upon the showing of unusual hardship. Unusual hardship can only be applied to the owner-occupied portion of the building. Each such extension shall be recorded in the file for the affected property and such record shall include a description of good faith effort, inability to accomplish within the original time, and hardship relied upon in granting the extension. No single extension shall exceed 60 calendar days unless weather conditions would prohibit correction of the violation within 60 calendar days. 
(2)  "Good faith effort" is defined as a substantial portion of the work completed or: 
(a)  The owner or agent has a signed and completed contract with a company that is capable of making the repair, and the contract was signed at a time that would have allowed the work to be completed in the time allowed by the department had not weather or natural disaster prevented. 
(b)  If the owner or agent or his/her staff is capable of making the repair, the owner or agent must present to the department a paid invoice or delivery order for the materials needed to make the repair and the materials must have been ordered at a time that would have allowed the repair to be made in the time allowed by the department, had weather conditions or natural disaster not prevented. 
(3)  Time extensions shall not be granted by the Building Official in imminently hazardous conditions, such as, but not limited to, gas leaks, no utilities, no heat in winter, unsafe fire egress, etc. 
    The Planning and Development Services Unit or the Housing Board of Appeals may grant a time extension due to the owner's inability to gain access to the unit if the owner has requested, by a letter sent by certified mail, reasonable times when the work can be done. 
(4)  The total time for making repairs of violations not constituting a hazard to health and safety, including the initial time and extensions by the Building Official shall not exceed 6 months. 
(5)  Additional extensions of reasonable periods, not to exceed 3 months, may be granted by the Housing Board of Appeals in cases where a person ordered to correct a violation has not been able to do so within the time set by the Building Official, despite all diligent effort. A bond may be required to be posted with the Building Official if the board determines one necessary to guarantee completion of the repairs. The bond amount shall be determined by the board based upon the repairs required by the housing bureau. 
(6)  Extensions must be sought within 1 working day after the expiration of the preceding time period, and decisions as to whether extensions will be granted must be made within 2 working days after the preceding time period. The Building Official shall keep written records of the reasons for granting time extensions.

(2)  Penalties. 
(a)  Violations of this chapter, for which no penalty is otherwise provided, shall be punishable by a fine of not less than $50.00 plus court costs. Legal proceedings shall commence against violators with the issuance of a ticket by the department. The service unit shall indicate on the ticket, when issued, the amount of the fine, should the violator plead guilty without a court appearance. In the event there is a court appearance and a conviction results, the prosecutor shall recommend, after consultation with the service unit, a fine of not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00 for each ticket. 
(b)  The service unit shall issue tickets under this chapter when violations of the chapter are found by any method of discovery, and are not corrected within the time period provided by the service unit and/or the Housing Board of Appeals. 
(c)  When an imminently hazardous situation exists which endangers the health or safety of tenants, the service unit shall shorten the time given to correct the problem to a reasonable period of time. 
(d)  When the imminently hazardous situation involves inadequate heat in the winter, flood, sewage backup, or any situation that requires tenants to vacate the premises, the owner or agent is required to provide alternative housing until the repair is made unless clauses in the lease by operation of the law terminate the tenancy. This subsection does not preclude the tenant from exercising other remedies provided by law or equity. 
(e)  In the event the owner or agent does not complete the repair within the time allowed, the service unit shall issue a ticket each week until the repair is completed, or for 8 weeks which ever occurs sooner. 
(f)  In the event the repair is not made after 8 weeks of tickets, or the time allowed by the service unit, or a shorter time if it is a hazardous situation, the service unit shall suspend the owner's certificate of compliance and notify the owner's tenants that the obligation to pay rent is suspended. 
(g)  In the event the repairs are not made 90 calendar days after the suspension of the certificate of compliance, the City Attorney shall institute receivership proceedings. Any occupant, tenant's group, or any other person may initiate such proceedings. 
(h)  Each day of violation of a provision of this chapter relating to the physical condition of any dwelling shall constitute a separate violation. 
(i)  A violation proved to exist on a particular day shall be presumed to exist on each subsequent day unless it be proved that the violation no longer exists. 
(j)  If a provision of this chapter is found to be violated in more than 1 dwelling unit or rooming unit in a multiple dwelling or rooming dwelling, each such violation shall constitute a separate violation. 
(k)  Abandonment of a dwelling shall not constitute a defense to the imposition of fines under this section. 
(l)  In the event any decision to impose penalties under this section is appealed to the Housing Board of Appeals, the penalties imposed after the appeal are held in abeyance until the Housing Board of Appeals has made its decision. Then either the fee will be paid including interest, or not paid depending on its decision. 
(3)  Receivership. 
(a)  When a suit has been brought to enforce this chapter against the owner, the court may appoint a receiver of the premises. 
(b)  When the court finds that there are adequate grounds for the appointment of a receiver, it shall appoint the municipality or a proper local agency or officer, or any competent person as receiver. The court shall give first priority to appointment of a qualified non profit receivership. In the discretion of the court, no bond need be required. The receivership shall terminate at the discretion of the court. 
(c)  The purpose of a receivership shall be to repair, renovate and rehabilitate the premises as needed to make the building comply with the provisions of this chapter, and where ordered by the court, to remove a building. The receiver shall promptly comply with the charge upon him in his official capacity and restore the premises to a safe, decent and sanitary condition, or remove the building. 
(d)  Subject to the control of the court, the receiver shall have full and complete powers necessary to make the building comply with the provisions of this chapter. The court may collect rents and additional revenue, subject to other legal remedies, hold them against the claim of prior assignees of such rents and other revenue, and apply them to the expenses of making the building comply with the provisions of this chapter. The court may manage and let rental units, issue receivership certificates, contract for all construction and rehabilitation as needed to make the building comply with the provisions of this chapter, and exercise other powers the court deems proper to the effective administration of the receivership. 
(e)  When expenses of the receivership are not otherwise provided for, the court may enter an order approving the expenses and providing that there shall be a lien on the real property for the payment thereof. The provisions of subsection (7) of section 8:519 as to the contents and filing of an order are applicable to the order herein provided for. 
(f)  In ordering receivership for a specified premise, the court shall, if necessary to enforce this provision, seek receivership on other units within the building that may currently carry a valid certificate. 
(4)  Actions for damages. 
(a)  When the owner of a dwelling regulated by this chapter permits unsafe, unsanitary, or unhealthful conditions to exist, unabated in any portion of the dwelling, whether a portion designated for the exclusive use and occupation of residents or a part of the common areas, where such condition exists in violation of this chapter, any occupant, after notice to the owner and a failure thereafter to make the necessary corrections, shall have an action against the owner for such damages he has actually suffered as a consequence of the occupation of the premises. The occupant shall also have injunctive and other relief appropriate to the abatement of the condition. 
(b)  Remedies under this section shall be in addition to such other relief as may be obtained by seeking enforcement of the section authorizing suits by the Building Official. The remedies shall be concurrent. When several remedies are available hereunder, the court may order any relief not inconsistent with the objectives of this chapter, and calculated to achieve compliance with it. 
(5)  Additional legal remedies. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to abolish or impair existing legal remedies of the City of Ann Arbor or its officers or agencies, or of any individual, even though such remedies may not be specifically enumerated or mentioned herein.

(1)  The city shall provide the City Clerk with booklets explaining the rights of tenants under city and state law. The City Clerk shall make such booklets available to local landlords and their agents to pick up at the Clerk's office without charge for distribution by local landlords to tenants and prospective tenants. In the event the Clerk makes available to local landlords sufficient copies of the booklet to permit those landlords to comply with this section, no owner of rental property located in Ann Arbor or agent of such an owner shall lease or contract to lease such property without furnishing to the tenant, before the time of leasing or contracting, a copy of said booklet. In the event a housing unit is being leased to more than 1 tenant, it shall be sufficient to offer a single booklet for each housing unit. In the event the lease or contract to lease is accomplished by mail, rather than face to face, the booklet shall be furnished to the tenant by mail. A landlord shall be deemed to have furnished a tenant a copy of the booklet if the landlord mails it to him or proffers a copy of the booklet to the tenant face to face, whether or not the tenant chooses to receive the booklet. For purposes of this section, the renewal of a lease shall be considered the same as the making of a new lease; however, if a landlord has previously furnished the tenant or tenants of a unit with a copy of the booklet, the landlord is not required to furnish another copy upon lease renewal. This section shall only apply to leasing and contract to lease transactions entered into 30 calendar days after the City Clerk has published in a newspaper of general circulation in Ann Arbor a notice to landlords informing them of this section and of the availability of said booklets at the Clerk's office. The Clerk shall publish such notice promptly upon receipt of such booklets from the City of Ann Arbor. 
(2)  At the same time an owner or agent of an owner furnishes a tenant with the booklet explaining the rights of tenants under city and state law required in subsection (1) above, each tenant shall also be provided by the landlord with specific information on how to register to vote and the requirements to register, notice that election information and further registration information is available on the Secretary of State's website as well as the city's website through the City Clerk's webpage and a copy of the State of Michigan Voter Registration Application. The City Clerk shall make available without charge for distribution by local landlords to tenants and prospective tenants copies of State of Michigan Voter Registration Application and the above election information on registration. The City Clerk may incorporate the election information as part of the above tenants' booklet or it may be produced separately. 
(3)  This section shall apply only to residential leases. Violations of this section shall be punishable by a fine up to $500.00 but may not be punished by jail. 
(4)  The failure of an owner or owner's agent to do any act required by this section shall not be construed to affect the validity of the lease or the enforcement of any of the lease provisions.

    No person owning or otherwise having authority to lease a residential dwelling unit in a building having more than 2 dwelling units shall execute a lease for such a dwelling unit to another person unless a statement is contained in the lease in 12-point boldface type, substantially in the following form: 
    Upon the execution of this lease, a tenant is entitled to receive a copy of the booklet provided by the City Clerk concerning the legal rights of tenants. By executing this lease, the tenant acknowledges receipt of such a booklet prior to execution of the lease. 
(Ord. No. 66-87, § 1, 12-21-87) 
8:527. - Smoke and fire detection devices. 
    No person shall let to another for occupancy any dwelling or dwelling units which are not equipped with smoke or fire detectors, or with an automatic fire alarm system. The type, number and location of the detectors of alarm systems must be approved by the Building Official in accordance with the standards contained in section 72 and 74 of the National Fire Code. The owner is responsible for assuring that the detectors and devices are maintained in good operating condition, and residents shall be responsible for informing the landlord if and when the device becomes inoperative. Batteries in battery operated detectors shall be replaced so that the device is always operative. 
(Ord. No. 66-87, § 1, 12-21-87) 
8:528. - Basic winterization in rental housing. 
(1)  Weatherization requirements. In order to help reduce the high cost and ecological harm of excess energy use, it is hereby ordained that no person shall let to another for occupancy any dwelling or dwelling units which are not equipped with weatherization in safe, good order as follows: 
(a)  All cracks or gaps in or between building materials which are used on exterior building surfaces or on surfaces which interface between heated and unheated spaces within the building, which allow loss of heat from the interior to exterior of the dwelling, or from heated to unheated spaces, including as well, where necessary, cracks or gaps in the interior or exterior walls, shall be sealed with weatherstripping or caulking or other insulation device or system so as to assure reasonable weatherization. Such weatherization shall include but not be limited to the following: All cracks at window frames where glass meets frame, and where frame meets wall, shall be applied with sealant material or weather resistant caulking outside the dwelling as needed. Cracks at door frames of doors providing access from unheated to heated space where any glass meets frame and where frame meets wall shall be applied with a sealant material or weather resistant caulking, both inside and outside the dwelling as needed. Cracks in windows or doors where sliding or swinging windows or doors meet their frames shall be sealed with spring steel, rubber, foam or other weatherstripping or insulation device, except where such window or door fits so tightly in its frame that such insulation is not useful to prevent heat leakage. Cracks at locations where the building structure is penetrated by utility connections, pipes, wires, dryer vents, exhaust fans or other objects, devices or systems, shall be applied with a sealant material or weather resistant caulking as needed. Accessible cracks where building foundation and structure meet, and where exterior siding material meets trim, and where exterior siding boards or pieces have separated due to warping, and at all fixed joints on the building, shall be repaired, if needed, and applied with a sealant material or weather resistant caulking. 
(b)  In every unheated attic or other unheated top story directly under the roof, the floor shall be fitted with insulation of such quality and grade that the insulation material alone, exclusive of the floor material, provides an R insulation value of not less than R-30. 
(c)  In every heated attic or other heated top story directly under the roof, the roof shall be fitted on its underside with insulation material of such quality and grade that the insulation material alone, exclusive of the roof material provides an R insulation value of not less than R-30. 
(d)  In the case of an unheated attic or other unheated top story, a variance may be granted in the proper circumstances for insulation under the roof rather than on or in the floor. 
(e)  If prior to December 1, 1985 the attic floor or roof has been insulated such that the insulation R value of the installed insulation alone, disregarding the insulating value of the structural elements is at least R-19, then the R-19 insulation shall remain sufficient and in compliance with this section.

(a)  An owner-occupant landlord; 
(b)  A bona-fide nonprofit cooperative;

(e)  A landlord who pays all of the utility heat bills for the dwelling and does not charge the tenant for heat or increases in utility heat bills; 
(f)  Where due to the unusual structural characteristics of the building or unit, the required weatherization cannot possibly be installed without extraordinary and unusual structural change, or would have no weatherization or insulating value, or is unnecessary because the respective floor or roof is so constructed as to continuously and at all places exceed without insulation the R value of the required insulation. 
(g)  Buildings constructed later than 1977, with the exterior envelope in compliance with Model Energy Code requirements, shall be exempt from the R-30 insulation provisions provided the exterior envelope and component materials are maintained. 
(3)  Effective date. The effective date for this section (8:528) shall be December 1, 1985. Required weatherization shall be kept in good order. 
(4)  Violations. Violations of this section shall be punishable by a fine of $1.00 to $100.00 at the discretion of the court, but no more than $50.00 for a person's first offense, and shall not be punishable by jail. 
(Section 8:528 adopted pursuant to the general city election of 4-1-85; Ord. No. 66-87, § 1, 12-21-87; Ord. No. 54-92, § 9, 8-17-92)

    No person who has injured or killed a dog or cat with a motor vehicle shall fail to, as soon as possible, stop said vehicle and notify either the police or the owner of the animal. 
9:42. - Keeping of chickens or ducks. 
(1)  Any Person who keeps chickens or ducks in the City shall, depending on the number of birds the Person will keep, obtain either a 2-bird permit or a 6-bird permit from the City prior to acquiring the chickens or ducks. A 6-bird permit is required for the keeping of more than 2 birds. No 6-bird permit shall be issued to a Person by the City, and no birds shall be allowed to be kept if 1 or more of the Persons to whom notice is sent as provided in subsection (2) objects to the issuance of the 6-bird permit. A 2-bird permit is required for the keeping of 1 or 2 birds and may be issued despite the objection(s) by any Person(s). To qualify for a 2-bird permit an individual must have no violations of this chapter for the previous 5 years. Written statements waiving the distance requirement in subsection (3) below are required for both 2-bird and 6-bird permits and shall be submitted at the time of application and become a part of the permit if issued. Application shall be made to the City Clerk and the fee for the permit shall be as determined by Council resolution. 
    Six-bird permits expire and become invalid 5 years after the date of issuance. Two-bird permits expire and become invalid 1 year after the date of issuance. A Person who wishes to continue keeping birds shall have obtained a new permit on or before the expiration date of the previous permit. Application for a new permit shall be pursuant to the procedures and requirements that are applicable at the time the Person applies for a new permit. 
    Only as used in this section, the term "bird" means only chickens or ducks or a combination of both. 
(2)  Once a completed application form for a 6-bird permit and application fee have been submitted to the City Clerk, the City Clerk shall, within 10 business days, send written notice of the application for a 6-bird permit to all owners of Adjacent Property as shown in the City Assessor's records. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, "Adjacent Property" means all parcels of property that the applicant's property comes into contact with at 1 or more points, except for parcels that are legally adjacent to but are in fact separated from the applicant's property by a Street or private street. 
(b)  The written notice described in this subsection shall be sent to the address(es) of all owner(s) of Adjacent Property, and also to the physical property address of an Adjacent Property, if the address of the owner of an Adjacent Property is different from the physical property address. 
(c)  If the applicant for the 6-bird permit is not the owner of the property on which the applicant wants to keep birds, the applicant must also provide the written consent of the owner of the property. Without such written consent, the application for the 6-bird permit may not be granted. 
(d)  The application for the 6-bird permit may not be granted if, within 21 days from the mailing of the written notice of the application, the City Clerk receives any objection to the issuance of a 6-bird permit from any owner or tenant of any Adjacent Property. 
(e)  A 6-bird permit shall be issued to the applicant if the City Clerk receives no objections to the issuance of a 6-bird permit from any owner or tenant of any Adjacent Property within 21 days from the mailing of the written notice of the application and all other requirements are met. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the issuance of a permit by the City, private restrictions on the use of property shall remain enforceable and take precedence over a permit. Private restrictions include but are not limited to deed restrictions, condominium master deed restrictions, neighborhood association by-laws, and covenant deeds. A permit issued to a Person whose property is subject to private restrictions that prohibit the keeping of birds is void. The interpretation and enforcement of the private restriction is the sole responsibility of the private parties involved. 
(4)  A Person who keeps or houses birds on a property shall comply with all of the following requirements: 
(a)  Have been issued the permit required under subsection (1) of this section. 
(b)  Keep no more than 6 birds if the Person has been issued a 6-bird permit and keep no more than 2 birds if the Person has been issued a 2-bird permit. 
(c)  The principal use of the Person's property is for a single-family dwelling, 2-family dwelling, or a primary or secondary school. 
(d)  No Person shall keep any rooster (male chicken). Both drakes (male ducks) and hen ducks (female ducks) may be kept. 
(e)  No Person shall slaughter any chickens or ducks. 
(f)  The birds shall be provided with a covered enclosure and must be kept in the covered enclosure or a fenced enclosure at all times. Fenced enclosures are subject to all provisions of Chapter 55 (Unified Development Code). 
(g)  A Person shall not keep birds in any location on the property other than in the Backyard. For purposes of this section, "Backyard" means rear yard as defined under Chapter 55 of this Code. For properties where the principal use is a primary or secondary school, a Person shall not keep birds in that property's front required setback area as defined under Chapter 55 of this Code. 
(h)  No covered enclosure or fenced enclosure shall be located closer than 10 feet to any property line of an Adjacent Property. 
(i)  All enclosures for the keeping of birds shall be so constructed or repaired as to prevent rats, mice, or other rodents from being harbored underneath, within, or within the walls of the enclosure. A covered enclosure or fenced enclosure shall not be located closer than 40 feet to any residential structure on an Adjacent Property provided, however, this requirement can be waived as follows: 
(i)  If the principal use of applicant's property is for a single-family dwelling, or a primary or secondary school, to obtain such a waiver the applicant shall present at the time of applying for a permit the written statements of all owners of Adjacent Property that there is no objection to the issuance of the permit. 
(ii)  If the principal use of the applicant's property is for a 2-family dwelling, to obtain such a waiver the applicant shall present at the time of applying for a permit the written statements of all Adjacent Property and of the occupants of the other dwelling stating that there is no objection to the issuance of the permit. 
(j)  All enclosures for the keeping of birds shall be so constructed or repaired as to prevent rats, mice, or other rodents from being harbored underneath, within, or within the walls of the enclosure. 
(k)  All feed and other items associated with the keeping of birds that are likely to attract or to become infested with or infected by rats, mice, or other rodents shall be protected so as to prevent rats, mice, or other rodents from gaining access to or coming into contact with them. 
(l)  If the above requirements are not complied with, the City may revoke any permit granted under this section and/or initiate prosecution for a civil infraction violation. 
(5)  A Person who has been issued a permit shall submit it for examination upon demand by any police officer or code enforcement officer. 
(6)  Permits that were issued under this section when the maximum number of chickens allowed was 4 chickens and before the effective date of the amendment to this section that increased the maximum number of chickens allowed to 6 under a 6-bird permit shall continue to allow a maximum number of only 4 chickens until the permit expires. A Person may keep more than 4 chickens and up to a maximum of 6 chickens only by obtaining a new 6-bird permit on or after the effective date of the amendment to this section that increased the maximum number of chickens allowed to 6. 
(7)  Permits that were issued under this section when only chickens were allowed and before the effective date of the amendment adding ducks to this section shall continue to allow only chickens until the permit expires. A Person may keep ducks only by obtaining a new 6-bird permit on or after the effective date of the amendment to this section that added ducks to this section.

9:54. - Deer feeding prohibition. 
(1)  Purpose and findings. 
    The purpose of this artificial feeding ban is to eliminate deer attractions which, when combined with other management strategies, should reduce, over time, the depredation impacts on residents, as well as assure the safety of the traveling public on city streets. 
The City Council finds: 
(a)  Recreational feeding of deer often causes deer concentrations which develop into depredation and other public safety problems; 
(b)  Depredation of garden crops and landscaping plants is increasing as deer habitat decreases and deer populations increase within particular areas and neighborhoods in the city; 
(c)  High deer populations can result in increased car/deer crashes within the community, causing public safety concerns. 
(2)  Acts prohibited. 
    No person may place or permit to be placed on the ground, or less than 5 feet above the ground surface any grain, fodder, salt licks, fruit, vegetables, nuts, hay or other edible materials which may reasonably be expected to result in deer feeding, unless such items are screened or protected in a manner that prevents deer from feeding on them. Living fruit trees and other live vegetation shall not be considered as deer feeding. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
This prohibition shall not apply to: 
(a)  Veterinarians, city/county animal control officers, parks maintenance staff, or county, state or federal game officials who are in the course of their duties, have deer in custody or under their management. 
(b)  Persons authorized by the City of Ann Arbor to implement the Deer Management Program approved by the City Council; or 
(c)  Any food placed upon the property for purposes of trapping or otherwise taking deer where such trapping or taking is pursuant to a permit issued by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. 
(d)  Persons feeding domestic animals or wild birds using feeding devices or containers. 
(e)  The use of straw, hay or straw-related materials for erosion control, mulching, gardening or other landscape purposes. 
(f)  Persons keeping of chickens as provided for under Section 9:42 of this Code. 
(4)  Enforcement. 
(a)  Injunctions. 
(i)  Violations of this chapter are hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance. 
(ii)  If, after written notice to comply, the proper owner fails to abate the nuisance, the City Attorney is authorized to commence civil proceedings for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief or any other appropriate civil remedy to abate or eliminate the public nuisance. 
(b)  Penalties. 
(i)  A violation of any provision of this chapter is a civil infraction punishable by a fine of not more than $100.00, for each day upon which a violation occurs after written notice is provided, plus all costs of the action. 
(ii)  A violation proved to exist on a particular day shall be presumed to exist on each subsequent day unless it is proved that the violation no longer exists. 
(iii)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit in any way the remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to the city or any other person for the prevention or elimination of a public nuisance.

Chapter 110 - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS 

9:85. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the City of Ann Arbor Domestic Partnership ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 62-91, § 1, 11-4-91) 
9:86. - Purpose. 
    Many persons today share a life as families in enduring and committed relationships apart from marriages. Some are lesbians, some are gay males, some are bisexual persons, and some are heterosexual persons. The City of Ann Arbor has an interest in strengthening and supporting all caring, committed and responsible family forms. The city has also long recognized the importance of cultural diversity and equal treatment and, toward that end, has adopted a human rights ordinance which protects its citizens from discrimination based on, among other things, marital status and sexual orientation. 
    This domestic partnership ordinance furthers the City of Ann Arbor's interest in families and in cultural diversity and equal treatment by establishing a mechanism for the public expression, sanction and documentation of the commitment reflected by the domestic partnership, whose members cannot legally marry or choose not to marry. It provides appropriate public recognition of these relationships. 
(Ord. No. 62-91, § 1, 11-4-91) 
9:87. - Definition of domestic partnership.

(4)  Neither of whom are married or in any other domestic partnership; and 
(5)  Who are at least 18 years of age and otherwise competent to enter into a contract. 
(Ord. No. 62-91, § 1, 11-4-91)

(Ord. No. 62-91, § 1, 11-4-91) 
9:90. - Notice of end of domestic partnership. 
    Notice of the end of a domestic partnership shall be accomplished as follows: 
(1)  To a domestic partner. A domestic partnership is terminated pursuant to section 9:89 when at least 1 of the partners signs (with notarization) a notice saying that the partnership has ended. If the declaration of domestic partnership was filed with the City Clerk, the notice must be filed with the Clerk to be valid. If 1 partner does not sign the notice, the Clerk shall mail a copy of the notice to the last known address of that domestic partner. If the declaration of domestic partnership was not filed with the City Clerk, then the notice of the end of the partnership must either be signed by both partners or be signed by both partners or be signed by 1 partner, notarized and mailed to the last known address of the other domestic partner. 
(2)  To third parties. When a domestic partnership ends, a former partner may cancel a declaration given to a third party by giving the third party a signed notice stating that the partnership has ended.

Editor's note- As per section 9 of Ord. No. 16-17, adopted Aug. 4, 2016, said ordinance codified herein, shall take effect on January 1, 2017. 

9:328a. - Findings. 
    That the City Council of the City of Ann Arbor hereby finds: 
That tobacco use is the number 1 cause of preventable death in Michigan and continues to be an urgent public health challenge, as evidenced by the following: 
  16,200 Michigan adults die from smoking-related diseases every year; 
  Nearly 1 in 10 Michigan youth who are alive today will die from early from smoking-related diseases; 
  Tobacco use can cause disease in nearly all organ systems and is responsible for 87% of lung cancer deaths, 79% of all chronic obstructive pulmonary disease deaths, and 32% of coronary heart disease deaths; 
That every year smoking costs Michigan nearly $9.4 billion dollars in direct healthcare expenses and lost productivity; 
That for the first time in 20 years, the adult smoking rate in Washtenaw County increased, from 12.3% in 2010 to 14.8% in 2015; 
That nearly 95% of people who smoke start by age 21; 
That individuals who begin smoking at an early age are more likely to develop a severe addiction to nicotine than those who start at a later age; 
That the younger people start smoking, the greater their risk of many adverse health outcomes, such as hospitalizations and lifetime risk of respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer; 
That tobacco use continues to be a significant public health concern for youth in the City of Ann Arbor, as evidenced by 9.2% of Washtenaw County high school students reporting that they have ever smoked a cigarette; 
That curbing tobacco use, particularly for youth, is especially important to the City of Ann Arbor; 
That the City of Ann Arbor created smoke-free outdoor public places in 2014 in an effort to curb tobacco use among city residents; 
That the University of Michigan Ann Arbor has the second largest undergraduate student population in Michigan (over 28,000 students in 2015-2016); 
That raising the minimum legal age for tobacco sales is important to protect the particularly large population of individuals under the age of 21 in the City of Ann Arbor; 
That the majority of youth under age 18 obtain tobacco through social sources as evidenced by: 
  41.4% of Washtenaw County high school students, including 53.7% of 11th graders, report easy access to cigarettes; 
  10.9% of Washtenaw County high school students who smoke usually give someone money to purchase their cigarettes; 
  37.0% of Washtenaw County high school students who smoke usually receive their cigarettes by asking someone they know for them; and 
  17.4% of Washtenaw County high school students who smoke usually get their cigarettes from someone who was 18 years or older; 
That the closer youth are to age 18, the easier it is for them to buy tobacco products from retailers as evidenced by: 
  The percentage of Washtenaw County high school students who usually buy their cigarettes from stores more than triples between 9th and 11th grade (4.2% of 9th graders usually buy their cigarettes at the store versus 15.6% of 11th graders); 
That studies have shown that young adults between ages 18 and 20 are more likely than adults over the age of 21 to purchase tobacco for minors; 
That raising the minimum legal age of access reduces the ability for youth under age 18 to appear legally old enough to buy tobacco products and decreases the probability that nonsmoking youth will have social contact and networks that contain smokers; 
That the Institute of Medicine found that raising the minimum legal age of access to 21 will likely delay initiation and reduce tobacco prevalence across all ages with the largest proportionate reduction in initiation likely occurring among adolescents of ages 15-17; 
That tobacco use continues to be a significant public health concern for young adults as evidenced by the following: 
  13.5% of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 in Washtenaw County smoke; and 
  18-to-24-year-olds are far more likely to use electronic smoking devices compared to all Washtenaw adults (7.3% versus 4.3%); 
That most individuals transition from experimental to regular smoking before age 21; 
That tobacco companies target young adults between the ages of 18 to 24 to increase the frequency with which they use tobacco products to encourage them to transition into habitual users; 
That research has repeatedly found that raising the minimum age of access is an effective strategy for reducing tobacco use among youth and young adults as evidenced by: 
  Research has overwhelmingly demonstrated that minimum legal drinking age laws decreased alcohol consumption rates in the United States, especially among youth and young adults; 
  An evaluation of Needham, MA's law raising the minimum tobacco sales age to 21 found that within 5 years the prevalence of youth smoking reduced by nearly half (12.9% in 2006 versus 6.7% in 2010); and 
  The Institute of Medicine found that a nationwide law raising the minimum age of legal access to 21 would save almost a quarter of a million lives of people born between 2000 and 2019; 
That smoking disproportionately affects African Americans in Washtenaw County, who are nearly 1.75 times more likely to smoke (25.9% of African Americans smoke versus 14.8% of all Washtenaw adults); 
That raising the minimum age of purchase may also address racial and ethnic inequities as communities of color are more likely to begin smoking after age 18; 
That as of April 22, 2016, at least 140 jurisdictions in 13 states have laws raising the minimum legal sale age for tobacco products to 21; 
That nationally, 70.5% of people, including 57.8% of people who currently smoke, support raising the minimum age of legal access to 21; and 
That, the minimum sale age for alcohol in Michigan is 21 years of age, and persons under 21 years of age have visibly different drivers' licenses. Raising the minimum sale age for tobacco would streamline identification checks and would establish a uniform age for the purchase of both products. 
The tobacco industry knows that raising minimum age to 21 will hurt sales and worked to roll age back from 21 to 18. 
Studies conducted by tobacco companies recognize that if "a man has never smoked by the age of 18, the odds are 3-to-1 he never will. By the age of 21, the odds are 20-to-1." 
Additionally, studies by tobacco companies have acknowledged that if they don't capture new users by their early 20s, it's unlikely that they ever will. 
Specifically, a Philip Morris report concluded, "Raising the legal minimum age for cigarette purchaser to 21 could gut our key young adult market."

(1)  Green. Green alone or "go". 
(a)  Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited. 
(b)  Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk. 
(2)  Yellow. Yellow alone or "caution" when shown following the green or "go" signal. 
(a)  Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection or at a limit line, when marked, but if the stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously through the intersection. 
(b)  Pedestrians facing such signal are hereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles. 
(3)  Red. Red alone or "Stop". 
(a)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line, when marked, or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until a green indication is shown, except as provided in subsection (b). 
(b)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal, after stopping before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or at a limit line when marked or, if none, then before entering the intersection, shall be privileged to make a right turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 2-way street or into a 1-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the right turn, or a left turn from a 1-way or 2-way street into a 1-way street carrying traffic in the direction of the left turn, unless prohibited by sign, signal, marking, light, or other traffic control device. The vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. 
(c)  No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the street unless he can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic. 
(4)  Steady green arrow indications.

10:35. - Passing vehicle at intersection. 
    Whenever any vehicle is stopped at a marked crosswalk or at any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the roadway, the driver of any other vehicle approaching from the rear shall not overtake and pass such stopped vehicle. 
10:36. - Right-of-way. 
    When 2 vehicles enter an intersection at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right, provided, however, where signs bearing the message "yield right-of-way" are erected upon the approach to an intersection, a driver approaching such sign shall slow to a reasonable speed for existing conditions of traffic and visibility, yielding the right-of-way to all traffic on the intersecting street which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard.

Upon the expiration of the time limit the Parking Meter shall indicate by a signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such cases, the right of the said motor vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the driver, possessor, or person having control thereof, shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter provided. 
(2)  Operation: Parking Meters shall be operated at such dates, times and hours as may be determined from time to time by the City, based upon good engineering principles, traffic investigation and surveys made from time to time, or recommendations from the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority or such other body deemed appropriate by City Administrator under the authority granted him/her by section 10:2 of this chapter. Such dates, times and hours shall be indicated by signs adjacent to the Parking Meter or on the Parking Meter. Provided, however, that the City Administrator, in his/her discretion, from time to time, may prohibit all parking in any or all metered Parking Spaces in a Parking Zone during times of emergency or public need or necessity by causing the appropriate "NO PARKING" signs to be posted or "NO PARKING" meter bags to be placed on Parking Meters or for any other reason or in any other manner specified to provide adequate public notice.

(a)  For manual Parking Meters, upon proper payment, the Parking Meter shall be placed in operation by turning or pressing any lever, handle, crank or other device provided upon such Parking Meter. 
(b)  For "pay and display" Parking Meters, upon proper payment, a receipt will be printed that must be displayed on the vehicle dashboard indicating the length of time the vehicle is authorized to occupy the parking space. 
Payments for metered Parking Spaces via an authorized mobile payment application will also be considered as satisfying the payment requirements of this section. 
Thereupon said parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle only until the meter indicates the time limit has expired. 
(2)  No person shall park, stand or stop any vehicle in a metered Parking Space, during a period for which a parking time limit is applicable, for longer than the maximum duration of time permitted by the Parking Meter. Each successive period of parking longer than said maximum time period constitutes a separate offense. The limit contained in this subsection is applicable regardless of whether or not the parking meter indicates the time limit has expired.

10:75. - Prima facie evidence; parking violators. 
    In any proceeding for violation of the parking provisions of this chapter, the parking, stopping or standing of any vehicle in a parking space at which the Parking Meter displays a flag, signal or sign indicating that the permitted or paid time has expired, or the "pay and display" receipt is properly displayed and indicates that the paid time has expired, or the parking enforcement software utilized by enforcement officers indicates the paid time for the vehicle has expired, or the "pay and display" receipt has not been property displayed, or the mobile application payment has been determined to have expired shall constitute a prima facie presumption that the vehicle has been parked in violation of this chapter.

(b)  When an odd/even parking prohibition is in effect, no person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle owned by him or her to remain parked on the following described portions of any street; provided, however, that the parking prohibition of this subsection does not apply during the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, so that vehicles can be positioned to comply with the next day's prohibition.

Article II: Zoning Districts
5.10 General| 5.10.1 Classification of Districts
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 14
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.10 General
Classification of Districts
Ann Arbor is hereby divided into zoning districts and overlay zoning districts listed in this Article II.
Zoning District Boundaries Shown on the Zoning Map
The boundaries of the zoning districts and overlay zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the zoning map that accompanies this chapter and that, with all notations, references and other information shown on that map, shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully described in this chapter. The Required Front Setbacks for downtown character overlay zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the Building Frontage Map that accompanies this chapter and that, with all notations, references and other information shown on that map, shall be as much a part of this chapter as if fully described in this chapter. The electronic version of the zoning map and Building Frontage Map reflecting all amendments approved by City Council shall be certified as the official copies by the City Clerk. Maps and descriptions accompanying enacted amendments shall be displayed adjacent to the official copy until such time as the official copy is corrected.
Interpretation of the Zoning Map
Where, due to the scale, lack of detail, or illegibility of the zoning map accompanying this chapter, there is an uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of any zoning district boundary as shown on that map, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make an interpretation concerning the exact location of the zoning district boundary. The Board, in arriving at a decision on these matters, shall apply the following standards:
A. Zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow Lot Lines, or be parallel or perpendicular to Lot Lines, or along the center lines of alleys, streets, rights-of-way or Watercourses, unless the zoning district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown on the zoning map.
B. Where zoning district boundaries approximately follow Lot Lines, the Lot Lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.
C. In unsubdivided property, or where a zoning district boundary divides a Lot, and no dimensions are shown on the zoning map the location of any boundary shall be determined by the use of the map scale shown on the map.
D. If, after the application of the foregoing rules, uncertainty still exists as to the exact location of a zoning district boundary, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine and fix the location of the line in a reasonable manner.
Relationship of Base and Overlay Zoning Districts
If a property is included in an overlay district listed in Section 5.14 , the standards of the overlay district shall apply in addition to the standards of the underlying base zoning district.
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.11 Residential Zoning Districts| 5.11.1 AG Agricultural-Open Space District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 15
In the event of an express conflict between the two sets of standards, the standards for the base
zoning district shall control.
5.11 Residential Zoning Districts
AG Agricultural-Open Space District
This district is intended to preserve open areas and to provide a desirable environment in the City and to ensure that the benefits of open areas, light, air, and private recreational activities can exist in well-planned locations throughout the City; to provide areas where farming can exist in the City both as an industry and to preserve, for the residents of the City, examples of a lifestyle that is rapidly disappearing; and to control the proximity of these uses to other uses.
R1A, R1B, R1C, R1D and R1E Single-Family Dwelling District
A. These Single-Family Zoning Districts are intended to provide an environment of Single-Family detached dwellings, along with other related facilities that serve the residents in the district such as schools, recreational facilities, Parks, and Religious Assembly. These districts should be convenient to commercial facilities in other zoning districts and to public transportation.
B. These districts are intended to encourage the preservation and continuation of the longstanding residential fabric in existing neighborhoods of predominantly Single-Family Dwellings, along with other related facilities that serve the residents in these districts.
C. Accessory Dwelling Units are allowed to enable a new housing prototype that respects the look and character of single-family neighborhoods while: supporting more efficient use of existing housing stock and infrastructure; providing housing that responds to changing Family needs, smaller households, and increasing housing costs; providing accessible housing for seniors and persons with disabilities; and supporting affordable housing goals.
D. Application of the R1D and R1E district may require a greater degree of services than the less dense Single-Family Zoning Districts. To assure health, safety and welfare, any future R1D and R1E zoning areas should be contingent upon the availability or provision of adequate public services to serve the higher densities permitted by that district, in addition to other pertinent planning considerations.
R2A Two-Family Dwelling District
This district is intended to provide residential areas in the City that are suitable for Two-Family Dwellings. The district is intended to create areas of essentially single-family residential character utilizing two Single-Family Dwelling Units that are attached either side to side or vertically. The district is intended to be similar to the higher density Single-Family Zoning Districts, except for the different type and slightly higher density of Dwelling Units. Location criteria for the application of this district should include the availability or provision of adequate public services to serve such higher densities. It may be used as a transition zone between single-family areas and other areas.
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.11 Residential Zoning Districts| 5.11.4 R2B Two-Family Dwelling and Student Housing District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 16
R2B Two-Family Dwelling and Student Housing District
This district is intended to permit Single-Family Dwellings and Two-Family Dwellings as well as to permit, in the vicinity of the University of Michigan campus, the operation of fraternities, sororities and student cooperatives affiliated with the University as well as other fraternities, sororities and student cooperatives. A further intent of this zoning district is to preserve the unique character and quality of the physical environment in this area of the City. The area is characterized by the presence of many large and architecturally distinctive houses set on relatively large Lots. Many Lots containing those houses are characterized by large Front Yard setbacks, mature and harmonious tree growth, and uniformity in architectural characteristics such as scale and use of materials. Any to existing houses and/or construction of new facilities should harmoniously reflect the overlying character of the surrounding environs.
R3 Townhouse Dwelling District
In addition to types of Dwellings permitted in the R1 and R2 districts, this district is intended to permit attached Dwelling Units to be arranged side by side in a low-density, Multiple-Family Dwelling fashion. These developments are most appropriate in the established areas of the City for infill purposes and perimeter areas of the City for large new developments and should provide the physical and social amenities of Open Space, recreational facilities, and compatibility with other residential land uses.
R4A Multiple-Family Dwelling District
In addition to types of Dwellings permitted in the R1, R2, and R3 districts, this district is intended to permit attached Dwelling Units to be arranged either side by side or one above the other in a low-density, Multiple-Family Dwelling fashion. These developments are most appropriate in perimeter areas of the City. Developments shall provide sufficient open land area to make them compatible with surrounding land uses and to provide for their residents an environment that is more than merely physically safe and healthy.
R4B, R4C, R4D, and R4E Multiple-Family Dwelling Districts
A. General Purpose Statement
In addition to the types of Dwellings permitted in the R1, R2, R3, and R4A districts, these Multiple-Family Zoning Districts are intended to permit attached Dwelling Units to be arranged one above the other or side by side.
B. Specific Purpose Statements
1. The R4B Multiple-Family Dwelling District is intended to allow small tracts of land in established areas for infill purposes or medium sized tracts of land for moderate-sized developments.
2. The R4C Multiple-Family Dwelling District is intended to be located in the central area of the City in close proximity to the central business district and the University of Michigan campus.
3. The R4D Multiple-Family Dwelling District is intended to permit higher density in the form of high-rise Buildings on substantial tracts of land located in areas other than downtown. Land use planning and Site design should minimize the impact of the permitted intensity of land use on
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.12 Mixed Use Zoning Districts| 5.11.8 R6 Mobile Home Park District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 17
adjacent property and on the community as a whole. Some of the criteria used in determining the location of this zoning district include:
a. The presence of natural land features that may be used to advantage in scaling down the potential impact on surrounding areas.
b. The location would enhance the bypasses and entrance ways to the City and provide a community focal or identity point.
c. The location would provide housing opportunities near outlying commercial, service, or employment centers.
4. The R4E Multiple-Family Dwelling District is intended to permit high-density, Multiple-Family development along signature transit corridors, as identified in the Citys Master Plan, with nearby access to public land, schools, shops, and Personal Services outside the DDA boundary. The elements of land use planning and Site design should ensure that the impact of such intensity of land use on adjacent property and on the community as a whole is minimized.
R6 Mobile Home Park District
This district is intended to permit a transportable Dwelling Unit that is suitable for year-round occupancy and contains the same type of public utilities as immobile housing, in accordance with state, county and City statutes, ordinances and regulations, including but not limited to the National Manufactured Housing Construction & Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C.A. 5401 et seq., as amended). These developments shall be located on Sites of sufficient size that enable development to be interspersed with functional Open Space.
5.12 Mixed Use Zoning Districts
O Office District
This district is intended primarily for Office Buildings. The Office district classification will be applied as a transitional use buffer between residential uses and nonresidential and special purpose uses which would be incompatible in direct contact with residential zoning districts.
C1 Local Business District
This district is intended solely to serve the needs of the surrounding residential neighborhood, providing goods that are day-to-day needs and are classed by merchants as "convenience goods and services." The normal spacing between these shopping districts is approximately one mile, and the total land area averages two acres. Businesses that might tend to be a nuisance to the immediately surrounding residential development are excluded, even though the goods or services offered might be in the convenience category or classification. The regulations are designed to permit development of the enumerated functions as limited by the standards designed to protect the abutting or surrounding residential land. The regulations establish standards comparable to the standards for residential zoning districts to result in similar area, height, and Building placement.
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.12 Mixed Use Zoning Districts| 5.12.3 C1A Campus Business District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 18
C1A Campus Business District
This district is intended primarily to serve as a neighborhood shopping area for the university-oriented population that is concentrated around it, providing goods that are day-to-day needs, specialty shops, and recreation. While the primary function of this district is to serve as a neighborhood shopping area for the student/faculty population concentrated around it, it also has a community-wide orientation due to its unique and distinctive commercial function peculiar to university-oriented population. These districts shall be located in close proximity to the central area of the City.
C1B Community Convenience Center
This district is intended primarily to serve the needs of the surrounding community. This includes establishments that although they primarily serve a surrounding neighborhood, could also serve a larger trade or service area. These districts tend to create greater environmental stresses than those uses permitted under C1, even though the goods or services offered might be in the convenience category or classification. Most people entering this district will come by automobile and typically park once. The economic welfare of merchandising activities in these districts depends on moderate Development of comparison shopping. Office Building activities are compatible with the purpose of the district as long as adequate and convenient automobile parking can be provided for both the Office and the retail merchandising activity.
C1A/R Campus Business Residential District
A. Purpose Statement
This district is intended to encourage the orderly clustering and placement of high-density residential and complementary commercial development near the campus Business district.
B. Special Standards
All commercial uses except Office uses shall not be permitted above the third Story.
D1 and D2 Downtown Districts
A. General Purpose Statement
These districts, in coordination with the character overlay zoning districts in Section 5.14 , are intended to support the downtown as the City's traditional center. The downtown serves both the region and local residents as a place to live, work, and take advantage of civic, cultural, educational, shopping, and entertainment opportunities. The downtown districts are intended to allow a mixture of land uses, dense urban development, pedestrian orientation, unique residential opportunities, and a compatible and attractive mix of historic and contemporary Building design. Development in these districts is designed to be accessible by a variety of modes of transportation.
B. Specific Purpose Statements
1. D1 - Downtown Core District
This district is intended to contain the downtown's greatest concentration of development and serves as a focus for intensive pedestrian use. This district is
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.13 Nonresidential and Special Purpose Zoning Districts| 5.12.7 C2B Business Service District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 19
appropriate for high-density mixed residential, Office, and commercial Development.
2. D2 - Downtown Interface District
This district is intended to be an area of transition between the D1 and surrounding residential neighborhoods. This district is appropriate for medium density residential and mixed-use Development.
C. Relationship to Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts
The D1 and D2 downtown zoning districts shall be further regulated by the character overlay zoning districts in Section 5.14 . Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, regulations identified for both the downtown district and the applicable character overlay zoning district shall apply.
C2B Business Service District
This district is designed to provide for certain types of commercial activities that have functional and economic relationships to downtown core or downtown interface commercial district. In this district the customer may come to the particular establishment either by automobile or as an extension of downtown pedestrian shopping activity. Since there is little essential interdependence of activities, each establishment should have its own automobile parking area. Good traffic accessibility is essential to this district, particularly for trucks and other freight carriers. The uses permitted, because of their required contact with auto and truck traffic, would be incompatible in the downtown.
C3 Fringe Commercial District
This district is intended to provide for certain types of commercial activities that have characteristics in common. In this district, the customer usually comes directly to the particular establishment by automobile, making a separate stop for each errand. Comparison shopping activity is less than in the downtown area. Since there is little essential interdependence of activities, establishments can be dispersed over considerable areas with each establishment having its own automobile parking. Good automobile accessibility is essential to these districts. The uses permitted, because of their lack of intense pedestrian activity and their required contact with auto access would be incompatible in the downtown area.
5.13 Nonresidential and Special Purpose Zoning Districts
R5 Hotel District
This district is intended to permit Hotels and certain institutional housing uses that provide nursing care for convalescence from illness or special care for the elderly.
P Parking District
This district is intended for off-street storage of noncommercial vehicles where no repair, sales, or services are rendered from the Parking Lot.
PL Public Land District
This district is intended to classify publicly-owned uses and land and permit the normal principal and incidental uses required to carry out governmental functions and services.

ORL Office/Research/Limited Industrial District
A. Purpose Statement
This district is intended to provide for a mixture of research, Office and light industrial uses whose external effects are restricted to the Site and do not adversely impact surrounding districts. The ORL district is structured to permit the manufacturing, processing, packaging, assembly, or treatment of finished or semi-finished products from previously prepared materials. The preservation of significant Natural Features and the encouragement of low-density, campus-like layouts are objectives for the establishment of such zones.

6. The emissions of air pollution shall not be detrimental to the public welfare.
M1 Limited Industrial District
This district is intended to provide land for various types of industrial and manufacturing uses that are compatible with one another. Properties included in this district are suited for use primarily by industries characterized by low land coverage, the absence of objectionable external effects and the possibility of large setbacks, attractive architecture and large, landscaped park-like areas. The purpose of the district is to provide suitable Sites for such uses while making certain that the allowed uses will be compatible with adjacent or surrounding districts. Development is limited to a low concentration, external effects are minimized, and permitted uses are limited to those which are adapted to an environment of this nature. Manufacturing plants and uses shall have performance characteristics similar to those uses allowed in this district in that they emit a minimum of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, dirt, toxic, or offensive odors or gases, glare, electromagnetic or atomic radiation. All uses shall be designed, constructed and operated so that there is no production of noise discernible at the Lot Lines in excess of the average intensity of street and traffic noise at the Lot Lines, nor any production of heat or glare discernible at the Lots Lines.
M1A Limited Light Industrial District.
This district is intended to provide land for various types of industrial manufacturing and certain low intensity commercial activity uses that are compatible with one another. The lands included in this district are those suited for use primarily by industries characterized by low land coverage, the absence of objectionable external effects and the possibility of large, landscaped, park-like areas. Manufacturing plants and uses shall have performance characteristics similar to those uses allowed in this district in that they emit a minimum of noise, vibration, smoke, dust, dirt, toxic or offensive odors or gases, glare, electromagnetic or atomic radiation. All uses located within this district shall be designed, constructed and operated so that there is no production of noise discernible at the Lot Lines in excess of the average intensity of street and traffic noise at the lines, nor any production of heat or glare discernible at the Lot Lines.
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.14 Overlay Zoning Districts| 5.13.8 M2 Heavy Industrial District
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 22
M2 Heavy Industrial District
This district is intended to provide land for more intense types of industrial and manufacturing uses that are usually located deep within the industrial areas of the City and downwind from residential and Business areas. Regulations to minimize their incompatibility with other residential zoning districts are the minimum required for mutual protection of the industrial areas. The district should not be adjacent to any residential or mixed-use district if that can possibly be avoided.
Planned Unit Development (PUD) District
A. Purpose Statement
The purpose of this district is to permit flexibility in the regulation of land Development; to encourage innovation in land use and variety in design, layout, and type of Structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy, and the provision of public services and utilities; to encourage provision of Open Space and protection of Natural Features; to provide adequate housing, employment, and shopping opportunities particularly suited to the needs of the residents of the City; to expand the supply of Affordable Housing Dwelling Units and to encourage the use, reuse, and improvement of existing Sites and Buildings that will be developed in a compatible way with surrounding uses, but where the uniform regulations contained in other zoning districts do not provide adequate protections and safeguards for the Site or surrounding area. The district is intended to accommodate developments with one or more land uses, Sites with unusual topography or unique settings within the community, or Sites that exhibit difficult or costly Development problems or any combination of these factors. This zoning district shall not be allowed where it is sought primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other zoning classifications or other City regulations rather than to achieve the stated purposes above.
5.14 Overlay Zoning Districts
Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts
A. General Purpose Statement
The purpose of these overlay zoning districts is to supplement the regulations for the D1 and D2 districts to reflect the diversity of historical and built environments within the downtown. These character overlay zoning districts account for differences in the existing street pattern, density, massing, and design features that exist throughout the downtown, in addition to the intent of the City for the future Development of each area.
B. Specific Purpose Statements
1. South University
The South University Overlay District lies along the southeastern edge of the University of Michigan central campus, which separates it from the other mixed use districts of downtown. This is an area characterized by a mix of Building types and sizes, with retail uses at the street level and relatively narrow Lot
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.14 Overlay Zoning Districts| 5.14.1 Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 23
Widths. The intent for this district is to maintain a variety in scale, with design that reflects the small-scale widths and heights of Buildings in the area at the Streetwall and locates taller portions toward the interior of the Lot. The South University D2 Character District lies just outside the DDA boundaries, adjacent to nearby residential neighborhoods. The intent for this district is to maintain a variety of small-scale commercial and retail enterprises mixed with some residential uses, minimizing the impact on nearby residential streets.
2. State Street
The State Street Overlay District frames the northwest corner of the University of Michigan central campus and defines the edge of the commercial core of the downtown. This area is characterized by a mixture of entertainment and retail uses with strong connections to the campus. The intent for this district is preservation of the integrity of the historic district properties and the overall historic character of the area, with design that includes features of the traditional commercial storefronts at the Sidewalk edge.
3. Liberty/Division
The Liberty/Division Overlay District is located in the core of downtown, yet retains a small-scale residential character. A significant portion of this district coincides with the East William Historic District, and for this reason, preservation of the integrity of these resources is a high priority, as is the retention of the overall sense of scale. While increased Building mass can be accommodated in this district, it is the intent to maintain the traditional scale and rhythm of residential Buildings.
4. East Huron 1
The East Huron 1 Overlay District is located on the north side of East Huron Street including North Fifth Avenue and South State Street, on a major transportation corridor through downtown and the address of many civic buildings, institutions and well-known landmarks of the downtown skyline. Most of its properties have free-standing buildings surrounded by open space, or have front courtyards or plazas, several of which are open to the public. There is a significant contrast between the massing and scale of the Structures within this character district and the residential scale of the Structures within this character district and the residential scale of the adjacent historic neighborhoods which surround the district on the north, east, and west sides. East Huron 1 lies between the Old Fourth Ward, Division Street and Ann Street historic districts and a business loop. This context is its defining feature and, therefore, calls for a higher degree of sensitivity in design and massing to strike a balance between the downtown core and adjacent historic residential neighborhoods.
5. East Huron 2
The East Huron 2 Overlay District is located on the south side of East Huron Street between South Division and North State streets, on a major transportation corridor through downtown. From east to west, this blocks character moves from campus-like settings with iconic, free-standing buildings surrounded by lawns seen in the round to historic, utilitarian commercial
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.14 Overlay Zoning Districts| 5.14.1 Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 24
buildings at the Sidewalk edge, matching the character districts placement between the University of Michigan Central Campus and downtowns civic core. North of this character district lies its sister character area, East Huron 1. To the south, East Huron 2 parallels an area of downtowns core that retains a small scale residential character.
6. Midtown
The Midtown Overlay District is framed on all sides by other downtown character residential zoning districts and contains the Fifth Avenue civic corridor. At present, this district lacks a strong sense of identity and is a place where creation of a new context should occur. The intent for this district is higher density development with a strongly defined street edge and Active Open Spaces.
7. Main Street
The Main Street Overlay District is the traditional heart of downtown, with a regional entertainment and Business focus. The center of the district contains the Main Street Historic District, and preservation of these resources is a high priority. The intent for this district is design that maintains the traditional rhythm of existing storefronts along the street edge and varying parapet lines.
8. Kerrytown
The Kerrytown Overlay District frames the north end of downtown and is characterized by a mix of small-scale commercial Buildings and houses that have been adapted to different uses. The eastern part of the district is part of the Old Fourth Ward Historic District, while the southeast corner of the district is located in the Fourth/Ann Historic District. The intent for this district is retaining traditional existing Building patterns, with lower-scale Building modules and residential shapes.
9. First Street
The First Street Overlay District runs north-south along the Ann Arbor Railroad and Allen Creek floodplain. This area is characterized by oddly-shaped blocks and a mixture of commercial storefronts, industrial Buildings and single-family homes. Many of these Buildings are located in the Old West Side historic district, which makes up much of the character area. The intent for this district is for infill development that preserves historic Buildings' assets, supports downtown activities, and provides non-motorized connections through preservation of a system of public and common Open Spaces. New Development along the Allen Creek floodplain should be sited to provide green space on Site and be located in such a way that it will connect with green space on abutting properties.
C. Applicability
The Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts provide additional regulations to the D1 and D2 districts. Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, regulations identified for both the downtown district and the applicable downtown character
Article II: Zoning Districts
5.14 Overlay Zoning Districts| 5.14.1 Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 25
overlay zoning district shall apply. In the case of a direct conflict between base zoning districts and overlay zoning district, the base zoning district provisions shall apply.
D. Building Massing Standards
Special building massing standards for the Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts are shown in Section 5.17.6A.
E. Building Front Setback Standards
Special building front setback standards for the Downtown Character Overlay Zoning Districts are shown in Section 5.17.6B.

The City finds that occupancy limits are needed to provide density control; preserve and enhance residential neighborhoods as stable, quiet places for citizens to live and raise children; protect safety and welfare; and maintain property values. Such limits are also needed to ensure that there are adequate public and private facilities including adequate off-street parking, utilities, and adequate Lot size to accommodate the residents of each Dwelling Unit without impairing the character of the neighborhood. The City also finds there are a number of residential living arrangements other than the traditional biological Family arrangement. This section is intended also to accommodate those alternative living arrangements.
2. Limits on Occupancy of Dwelling Unit
A Dwelling Unit may be occupied by one of the following Family living arrangements:
a. One or more Persons related by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship living as a single Housekeeping Unit, in all districts.

Article IV: Development Standards
5.17 Area, Height and Placement Regulations
Intent
The intent of this section is to provide clear and consistent area, height, and placement regulations, collectively known as dimensional standards, for construction in the City. The standards are intended to require the appropriate placement of Buildings that result in improved non-motorized access, adequate Open Space, and the efficient use of land and infrastructure consistent with principles of sustainable land use practices described in adopted City master plans. Maximum setback regulations are intended to result in the placement of Buildings sufficiently close to the Public Right-of-Way to better provide access for pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit passengers.
General Requirements
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, regulations governing Lot Area, Lot Width, Lot Area per Dwelling Unit, Floor Area Ratio, Open Space, Active Open Space, Required Setback Lines, Building Height, and other pertinent factors are as shown in Tables 5.17-1 through 5.17-5 and Section 5.18 .
Residential Zoning Districts
A. Determination of Number of Dwelling Units
The determination of the permitted number of Dwelling Units in the "R" Residential zoning districts shall be made as follows: The Lot Area of the parcel in question is divided by the "minimum Lot Area per Dwelling Unit" for the type of unit desired (or by the average for a variety of types) with the quotient being the number of Dwelling Units permitted. Lot Area includes land donated or to be donated to the City for public park purposes, which is acceptable to the City. Lot Area does not include the area of dedicated or proposed Public Right-of-Way or the area of private street easements in the R1 and R2 districts.26
B. Dimensional Tables for Residential Zoning Districts
Dimensional standards for Residential Zoning Districts provided in Tables 5.17-1, 5.17-2, and 5.17-3.

1. Abutting a Public Right-of-Way.
2. Abutting a private street easement.
3. For Lots zoned for nonresidential use:
A permanent recorded unobstructed access and utility easement that is a minimum of 30 feet in width as shown on an approved site plan may serve as the sole means of access to a Public Right-of-Way or private street. The easement shall include provisions for the maintenance of improvements and utilities. For such Lots, the Lot Line most parallel with the Public Right-of-Way or Private street shall be designated as the Front Lot Line. Other Lot Lines shall be determined as provided in this ordinance. Required Setbacks shall be provided in accordance with the Schedule of Area, Height and Placement regulations in this ordinance, with the exception that if the distance between the Front Lot Line and the Public Right-of-Way or private street is more than the Required Front Setback for the zoning district in which the Lot is located, no Required Front Setback Area shall be required.
4. For Lots zoned solely for Single-Family Dwelling use:
A permanent recorded unobstructed access and utility easement that is a minimum of 30 feet in width may serve as the only means of access to a Public Right-of-Way or private street for a maximum of two Lots or parcels subject to the following:

a. Driveways within the easement shall meet all applicable ordinances, including but not limited to Section 5.19 .
b. The easement shall include provisions for the maintenance of the Driveway and any other improvements and utilities.
c. For Lots where the easement is the only means of access, either the Lot Line most parallel with the Public Right-of-Way or private street, or most perpendicular with the Public Right-of-Way or private street, shall be designated by an Applicant as the Front Lot Line, and the minimum Required Front Setback Area shall be provided for the entire length of that Front Lot Line.
5.22 Storm Water Management and Soil Erosion
No Person shall conduct activity for which a permit under this Section 5.22 or related Section 5.29.3 is required without first having obtained the required permit. After the permit has been obtained, no Person shall conduct any activity in violation of any condition of that permit, or without having the permit and plans on Site. Throughout this Section, the Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner, and the Commissioners office, are referred to as WCWRC.
Purpose
A. The City Council recognizes and is concerned that excessive quantities of soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing Development for non-agricultural uses such as housing developments, industrial areas, recreational uses, and roads. This Erosion makes necessary costly repairs to gullies, washed out Fills, roads, and embankments. The resulting Sediment clogs storm sewers and road ditches, muddies Watercourses and silts-in lakes and reservoirs, and is considered a major water pollutant, which degrades the natural environment within its jurisdiction and is costly to remedy.
B. Water quality and quantity within the water resources of the City is a public concern. As the City is developed, natural vegetation is removed and replaced with Impervious Surfaces. As a result the hydrology of Watercourses, ponds and Wetlands is changed. These changes in quantity, speed, and timing of water runoff transform Ann Arbor's Watercourses. As the volume and speed of water increases, so does the erosive action of runoff on hillsides, stream banks and bottoms. As more soils are transported down waterways and as more damage occurs to stream banks and bottoms, natural systems are destroyed or diminished throughout the watershed. Urban activity also contaminates the land's surface. Contaminants are carried with runoff into all aquatic habitats, where they poison wildlife and contribute to the decline of aquatic resources. For people, the combination of these effects diminishes the quality of drinking water, inhibits healthy fisheries, reduces recreation and lessens scenic beauty. The City recognizes the relationship between land use and water quality; and by doing so, desires to control non-point source water pollution. Strategies to control storm water quantity are different from the strategies to improve water quality. This section intends to improve the effectiveness of Storm Water Management Systems, bring greater effort to control the sources of runoff, and to improve water quality.

Management
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 118
C. The purpose of this Section 5.22 is to control soil Erosion and the resulting Sediment; and to control the impact on water quality and quantity resulting from Development and Impervious Surfaces within the City by requiring proper provisions for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience and general welfare of the community. Compliance with Part 91 of Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of 1994, as amended, (MCL 324.9101 to 324.9123) and the rules promulgated under this part of the Michigan Compiled Laws, is fully intended.
Single or Two-Family Residential Storm Water Management
A Site with one Single or Two-Family residential dwelling, with or without Accessory Structure(s), that adds 200 square feet or more of Impervious Surface, on-site Storm Water Management Systems shall be required and shall meet the following requirements:
A. Retention/infiltration of the first flush storm events for the net increase in Impervious Surface, in compliance with the Rules of the WCWRC.
B. Redirection of all downspouts to vegetated areas or other approved point, but not to Impervious Surfaces, as is required by the Drainage Nuisances and Complaints Section of Chapter 100 of City Code.
C. On-site storm water control is not required for new homes in a site planned Development for which a development-wide system that complies with the storm water management requirements of this chapter has been installed and accepted.
Storm Water Management Systems
Compliance with the Storm Water Management System criteria of this Section 5.22 is required for any form of construction or removal or disturbance of any Natural Features that requires approval for any site plan, final preliminary plat, or PUD site plan, but is not required for issuance of Grading Permits that do not require site plan, final preliminary plat, or PUD site plan approval.
Site plans for administrative approval that do not increase the total impervious area of the Site and are not within the jurisdiction of the WCWRC shall be exempt from the Storm Water Management System requirements of this Section 5.22 .
A. For Sites within the jurisdiction of the WCWRC; or Sites with Storm Water Management Systems under multiple ownership or for multiple parcels, including but not limited to site condominiums; or residential developments containing greater than four Dwelling Units within two or more detached Structures; or Sites with Storm Water Management Systems serving more than one parcel; the Storm Water Management System shall be reviewed and receive preliminary plan approval from the WCWRC prior to site plan, final preliminary plat, or PUD site plan approval by the City. For Sites that require review by the WCWRC, a permit or letter of final plan approval from the WCWRC Office shall be obtained prior to issuance of a Grading Permit by the City. Any exceptions to the Rules of the WCWRC listed in this Section 5.22 are not applicable to reviews performed by the WCWRC.

Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 119
B. For Sites other than described in Section 5.22.3A that contain or are proposed to contain more than 5,000 square feet of Impervious Surface, on-site Storm Water Management Systems shall be required for any Site that is the subject of a site plan, final preliminary plat, or PUD site plan. The Storm Water Management System shall be reviewed and receive approval from the PSA Administrator and meet the design criteria stated in the Rules of the WCWRC, with the following exceptions:
1. For Sites that contain existing Impervious Surfaces, adding or removing and replacing Impervious Surfaces solely for the purpose of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or compliance with the State of Michigan Barrier Free Design Rules (Public Act 1 of 1966, as amended) shall be exempt from the Storm Water Management System requirements of this chapter.
2. Sites proposed to contain:
a. Impervious Surfaces greater than 5,000 square feet and less than 10,000 square feet require retention/infiltration only of the first flush storm events.
b. Impervious Surfaces equal to or greater than 10,000 square feet and less than 15,000 square feet require retention/infiltration only of the first flush and detention only of bankfull storm events.
c. Impervious Surfaces equal to or greater than 15,000 square feet require retention/infiltration of the first flush, and detention of bankfull, and 100-year storm event. Detention facilities designed for the 100-year storm event shall include a Sediment forebay.
3. Public Sidewalks are not required to be included in the storm water management calculations.
4. If the Site is located in an historic district designated by the City, then the Roof area of the historic Building(s) is not required to be included in the storm water management calculations. This exemption does not apply to noncontributing Structures within the historic district.
C. Within the D1 and D2 zoning districts, or Sites outside the D1 and D2 zoning districtsthat contain existing Impervious Surfaces, alternative methods of storm water detention may be allowed by the approving body if each of the following conditions are met:
1. Control of the first flush storm event has been provided.
2. A determination is provided by an Architect or Professional Engineer that Storm Water Management Systems have been provided on-site to the maximum extent feasible and that it is not feasible to provide any additional detention volume due to Site constraints including but not limited to existing Buildings, loss of existing parking below that required Section 5.19 or protection of Natural Features.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.22 Storm Water Management and Soil Erosion| 5.22.3 Storm Water Management Systems
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 120
3. The alternative method of storm water detention is consistent with the intent of this Section 5.22 and the goals of the Rules of the WCWRC, as determined by the City Planning Manager.
4. The alternative method of storm water detention is specifically approved on a site plan, final preliminary plat, or PUD site plan in a separate motion by the approving body. Where staff is the approving body, the alternative method of storm water detention shall be approved by the Planning Commission.
5. The alternative method of storm water detention provides an equal or greater amount of resources, in the form of money or land or both, to the City that are at least as beneficial as the required volume of storm water detention that is not being provided on-site. The resources required shall be computed for residential sites at $2.00 per square foot and commercial sites at $2.50 per square foot of Impervious Surface not served by a detention facility meeting the design criteria of this section.
6. The alternative method of storm water detention is provided through one or both of the following methods:
a. The Applicant donates money to the City for the express purpose of improving Storm Water Management Systems within the same watershed such as, but not limited to, regional detention, regional water quality improvements facilities, or increasing floodplain storage capacity. The money may not be used for maintenance of existing public facilities.
b. The Applicant donates land to the City for the express purpose of improving Storm Water Management Systems within the same watershed. The donation of land is subject to acceptance by City Council. The donated land shall be suitable to be effectively used for improvements of the storm water system within the same watershed and pass Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments prior to acceptance by City Council. The value of the land shall be determined by an appraisal prepared by an independent appraiser acceptable to the City Administrator. The appraisal will be submitted to the City Administrator who may use an independent review appraiser to assist with review.
D. On a Site that requires the installation of a Storm Water Management System the detention facility shall be installed and stabilized prior to the issuance of building permits. The PSA Administrator may deem it necessary to modify the timing of installation of the detention facility when conditions, such as a detention facility that is integral to the Structure of a new Building, prevent installation prior to building permits. As-built verification from an Architect or Professional Engineer shall be submitted to the Planning Manager for approval prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy. The as-built verification shall include: elevations and volumes, outlet sizes and elevations, Stabilization information, and signature and seal of an Architect or Professional Engineer. A sample form may be provided by the Planning Manager upon request.

5.22 Storm Water Management and Soil Erosion| 5.22.4 Grading Operation Responsibility
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 121
E. Existing Wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of Storm Water Management Systems unless it is determined that the existing Wetland is not regulated by Sections 5.23 and 5.29.4. Where modifications to Wetland areas are allowed, the existing storage shall be maintained and shall not count toward meeting the requirements of this section.
F. When residential Lots or units are proposed to be created, the runoff coefficients shall take into account the future Impervious Surfaces of these building Sites within the storm water management calculations.
G. Storm Water Management System facilities shall be designed so that any discharge of storm water from the facility, which does not empty directly into a drain, shall be converted to sheet flow over the ground through the use of an energy dissipater, in a manner which will preclude Erosion, or other approved method as determined by the PSA Administrator.
H. Prior to the issuance of a Grading Permit, the developer of the Storm Water Management System shall provide the City with an agreement, satisfactory to the City Attorney, that if maintenance is not performed to the reasonable satisfaction of the City Planning Manager the City may, after posting reasonable notice on the Site, perform the maintenance activities and charge all costs to the benefited properties. If the costs remain unpaid for 60 days, the City may assess those costs to the benefited properties as a single Lot assessment under City Code Section 1:292.
Grading Operation Responsibility
Any Person engaged in Grading operations and/or the permittee shall be responsible for:
A. Installing Temporary Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Measures before any Earth Change activity, and maintaining the measures on a daily basis.
B. Preventing damage to any public utilities or the interruption of utility services within the limits of Grading and along any routes of travel of the equipment.
C. Preventing damage to adjacent property. No Person shall Grade land so close to the Lot Line as to endanger any adjoining public , Sidewalk, Alley or any public or private property without supporting and protecting such property from settling, cracking or other damage which might result.
D. Carrying out the proposed work in accordance with the approved plans, and sequence of construction, and in compliance with all the requirements of the permit and this Section 5.22 .
E.

Persons carrying out soil Erosion and Sediment control measures under this chapter, and all subsequent owners of property upon which such measures have been taken, shall maintain all permanent anti-Erosion devices, retaining walls, Structures, plantings and other protective devices.
Liability
Neither the issuance of permits, under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or with any condition imposed by the Planning Manager under this chapter, shall relieve any Person from the responsibility for damage to any Persons or property otherwise imposed by law, nor impose any liability upon the City for damages to Persons or property.
5.23 Natural Features
Purpose and Intent
It is the intent of this section to establish how Natural Features shall be identified, evaluated, protected, and mitigated, and to require minimum buffers adjacent to Natural Features, as defined herein, and to regulate property within such buffer in order to prevent physical harm, impairment or destruction of or to a Natural Feature. It has been determined that, in the absence of such minimum buffers, intrusions in or on to Natural Features would occur,
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.2 Protected Natural Features
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 123
resulting in harm, impairment and/or destruction of Natural Features contrary to the public health, safety and general welfare. This regulation is based on the Citys general police power, for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, including the authority granted in the City and Village Zoning Enabling Act (Act 207, Public Acts of 1921, as amended) and the Michigan Zoning Enabling Act (Act 110 of 2006, as amended).
Protected Natural Features
Seven Natural Features are protected and regulated in the City: Endangered Species Habitats, Floodplains, Woodlands, Landmark Trees, Steep Slopes, Watercourses and Wetlands. Each protected, regulated Natural Feature is discussed in substantial detail particularly with respect to:
A. A summary of key facets including a perspective on the importance of the Natural Feature to the people of the City.
B. Means to identify, differentiate and evaluate the Natural Feature.
C. The general Natural Feature protection priorities of the City, and some perspective on how to measure each Natural Feature's relative importance to others in the City or on the Site.
D. Measures for protecting Natural Features during construction.
E. Guidelines and requirements for mitigating important Natural Features which cannot be excluded from Development.
Endangered Species Habitats
Endangered species are most likely to be found in the midst of natural areas described in this section as "highest concern." When a rare, threatened or endangered species is found, careful assessment should be made of the species and the area in which it is found. These organisms and their habitat may be intolerant of change caused by a Development, such as change in hydrological conditions, even if the habitat itself is outside the Limits of Soil Disturbance for a project. These species and their habitats are important to the City for the richness and diversity of species they offer.
A. Identification
Within Ann Arbor, the areas most likely to contain endangered species are sandy, wet bottom lands and Wetlands along the Huron River, along its tributaries, and in the many small pocket Wetlands in native forest fragments. Many of these areas can be quite small in size. Rare and unusual endangered species (of ferns, bryophytes, orchids, grasses, etc.) may also be found on disturbed ground-- including along shorelines and streambanks, flooded areas, old farmed fields, Borrow Pits, eroding slopes, burned areas, embankments along railroads and roads, in cemeteries, old settlement areas and farmsteads, etc.
B. Protection Priorities
The protection of endangered species and their habitats are regulated by the State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The City will work in coordination with state and federal regulating agencies to identify the best protection approach, based on the specific
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.4 Floodplains (100-Year)
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 124
characteristics of the species involved. In general, these species and their habitats should be excluded from Development and protected from the impact of Development.
C. Protection Measures
1. The City will work in coordination with state and federal regulating agencies to identify appropriate protection measures to sustain the species, based on the specific characteristics and needs of the habitat and species involved.
2. During Grading and construction, barrier fencing shall be installed at the Limits of Soil Disturbance, including all Endangered Species Habitats. Barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until authorized to be removed. No filling, excavating or storage of materials, Debris, or equipment shall take place within the fenced area.
D. Mitigation
Endangered species habitat shall be mitigated in accordance with the Michigan Natural Resources and Environment Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended to date. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance. The density and coverage of vegetation (except trees) shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting.
Floodplains (100-Year)
Floodplains serve to minimize damage to land and water resources because of their capacity to store water. In so doing they control Erosion, silting, and contamination of water features and aquatic wildlife. Healthy, stable plant life is important in determining a Floodplain's capacity and function in slowing, filtering, and cooling water moving through them. Floodplains also may qualify as Wetland or Watercourse Natural Features.
A. Identification
Floodplains, Floodways and Watercourses that have watersheds two square miles or larger are officially mapped and regulated under provisions of federal and state statutes. Floodplain and Floodway boundaries are available on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The City may request, and if requested an Applicant shall provide, investigation and mapping of flooding zones along Watercourses on Sites not officially mapped. If substantial flooding potential exists, and Buildings and structures are proposed in the Floodplain, the City may request, and if requested an Applicant shall provide, formal hydrological studies to determine the long-term safety and the hydrological and environmental soundness of a proposed project.
B. Protection Priorities
1. Highest Concern
Floodplains with natural plant life and natural landform conditions are very important to protect from Development. They involve native Floodplain
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.4 Floodplains (100-Year)
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 125
forest fragments (extremely rare), or native sedge or fen meadows (rare and important natural areas, potentially habitats for rare species in the City). These areas not only are rich biologically, but provide floodplain function.
These Floodplains of highest concern should be preserved as part of any Development proposal (which means not only is there no disturbance to soils, but there is no disturbance to surface and subsurface hydrological regimes). In cases where these habitats exist and are being invaded by exotics, every reasonable effort should be taken to restore the habitat as part of a Development proposal. Where enhancement of capacity and function can be done, it should be.
2. Midlevel Concern
Forested Floodplains dominated by exotics, including black alder, several willows, and Floodplain meadows dominated by cattails or purple loosestrife are of midlevel concern. Even with the presence of exotics, forested Floodplains are vital to the continued function/capacity of the floodplain. Whenever possible, these areas should be left undisturbed. Restoration of these areas with native plants is usually useful in enhancing its function, appearance, and wildlife value.
Floodplains of midlevel concern should not be built upon. In any case, the Floodplain's function and capacity should not be diminished. Where enhancement of capacity and function can be done, it should be.
3. Lowlevel Concern
Floodplains characterized by paving or turf or otherwise cleared land are of low level concern. They can further be developed or redeveloped as necessary. A key concern to guide such decisions should be whether there are flooding and water quality problems in the watershed, and what opportunity exists for mitigation to address these problems through the proposed Development or redevelopment.
C. Protection Measures
1. Soil Erosion on any construction Site in any Floodplain should be minimized to the maximum extent practicable. Special, effective soil Erosion and flood protection techniques should be devised and required in each instance, during construction and for as long afterward as it takes for vegetation to become very well established and for soils to be stable during storm/flooding events. These techniques and devices need careful design and maintenance to protect against washout in storm events and damage to water resources.
2. Barrier fencing shall be installed at the Limits of Soil Disturbance including any Floodplain. Barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until authorized to be removed. No filling, excavating or storage of materials, Debris or equipment shall take place within the fenced area.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.5 Woodlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 126
D. Mitigation
Floodplain areas shall be mitigated to provide no net loss of flood storage capacity and shall comply with any conditions of a valid permit from the Michigan Department of Environment Quality in accordance with the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended to date. If mitigation is proposed off-site, it shall be located in the same watershed as the development Site. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance. The density and coverage of vegetation (except trees) shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting.
E. Guidelines for Best Mitigation Practices
1. Where the actual volume/land area of a Floodplain is affected by a proposed Development, the volume/land area of the Floodplain lost should be restored elsewhere on the Site or in the watershed.
2. Where paved surfaces are proposed in a Floodplain, they should be minimized to the fullest extent possible. The area of paved surface on a Site in a Floodplain should be mitigated by new Floodplain with native Floodplain species installed elsewhere on the Site or elsewhere in the watershed, or it should be mitigated by a landscape design for the Site that enhances Floodplain function.
3. Where forest fragments, fen and sedge meadows are removed or disturbed, they should be mitigated to replicate equally valuable Natural Features on the Site or in some other location in the watershed.
4. Lesser quality plant communities should also be replaced, but the level of diversity of the mitigation may be less (using native associations is more desirable).
5. To the fullest extent possible, regardless of existing conditions, landscape design for a project proposed in a Floodplain should avoid turf and use (preferably native) associations of plant materials that can become effective on the Site as healthy Floodplain plant communities.
6. Alternate mitigation (when these procedures are not possible) could include management of other Natural Features on the Site or restoration work on Floodplains elsewhere on the Site or within the watershed. They might include addition of storm water control facilities beyond other code requirements.
Woodlands
The City's Woodlands are of two primary types, either planted and volunteer, or naturally regenerating native forest. Whether planted, volunteer naturally regenerating native forest, or a grove of old trees, Woodlands are important to the scenic and biological quality of life of the City.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.5 Woodlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 127
A. Identification
1. Native forest fragments
Native forest fragments are visible on early low altitude aerial photographs of the City, before the invasion of exotic Woody Plants. These fragments are typified by their unfarmed soils and by the combination of plants constituting an ecosystem association recognizable as dating back to 1824. These fragments can be Floodplain forests (Black and Silver maples, Red ash, hickories), wooded mesic or Wetland forests (red oak and red maple), dry forests on the tops of sand and gravel filled moraines and kames (White oak, Hickories and White ash), to mesic forests on moister upland soils (Sugar maple, Red maple and American beech). A very wide variety of species existed as part of these associations, and can be present in the regenerating fragments.
2. Urban Woodlands
Urban Woodlands are areas which have the density necessary to meet the definition of Woodland used by the City, but which are not native forest fragments. Groves of planted trees, often of pines or spruces are found throughout the City. Volunteer trees may come into an area so densely as to create a Woodland under the definition. Some people may plant and cultivate trees densely enough to qualify. These landscapes do not function as self-sustaining ecosystems, but they can function as valuable wildlife habitat, can provide great scenic resource, do influence the climate, and make life in the City more enjoyable for people.
3. Pioneer Woodlands
Pioneer Woodlands are those which arise on disturbed soils, such as soils which have gone through a period of cultivation in the European monocultural style, or soils which have been overturned, moved, or graded to the extent that seed (and the related, beneficial soil microflora) for regenerating the ecosystem is destroyed or greatly diminished. Pioneer Woodlands are usually found on abandoned farm fields or waste sites of various sorts. These Woodlands are often dominated by invasive exotic shrubs and are impoverished wildlife sites.
In some cases, native forest fragments are colonizing into fields once farmed adjacent to them. These areas are rich wildlife habitats and should be treated with care, along with the native forest fragments.
B. Protection Priorities
1. Highest concern
Native forest fragments, particularly those that still have a wide diversity of native species at all levels (woody and herbaceous plants) are the most important Sites to protect from Development and from the impact of Development. Many of these Sites have been and are being rapidly invaded by exotic species (of shrubs, primarily), and need active care as well as protection to sustain them. The highest quality among these fragments should not be built upon. These fragments should be retained as public land and
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.5 Woodlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 128
managed as natural areas. Effort should be made to preserve and protect all remaining native forest fragments to the fullest extent possible. Further fragmentation is not desirable.
2. Midlevel concern
Ann Arbor's urban Woodlands are directly derived from people's planting activities, as the City developed. Woods and trees involved in these settings very likely have considerable importance to people who live near them.
3. Lowlevel concern
Generally speaking, pioneer Woodlands that are now developing in the City are often dominated by exotic trees and shrubs, with an occasional large native tree that a farmer retained in his field. New, well designed and well planted built landscapes would be more appealing and more valuable in the long term, than protecting these Woodlands. Vegetation must be removed in order to return it to a more natural and pleasing landform. Landmark Trees and other valuable features may exist on the Site. If so, they would be key concerns in the design of Development for these areas. Rare, endangered species can also exist on disturbed Sites.
C. Protection Measures
1. Native forest fragments excluded from Development should be defended from all intrusions during Development by well-maintained barrier fencing.
2. Where native forest fragments are to be built in, but not completely removed, then those areas to be excluded from Development should be clearly fenced during the process. Grading, roads, walkways, utility lines, and all other aspects of soil disturbance should be minimized to the fullest extent that sound design and public safety will allow.
3. Clearing for Buildings should be strictly minimized to the least area needed to work around Buildings. Excavated spoils from basements and other needed Grading should not be spread on the Site in the native forest fragment area. Very careful handling of trees near the building envelope should be undertaken to the fullest extent possible.
4. Where management of retained native forest fragments is undertaken, these activities should be conducted according to the principles and techniques described in a welldeveloped management plan. Advice from qualified natural area managers should be sought and included in such plans. A key element of these plans should be the control of Invasive Species, which threaten natural areas throughout the City.
5. The most effective way to save trees is by planning ahead for their protection. Four steps will help accomplish this:
a. Delineate areas with severe limitations and stay away from them (provide barriers).
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.5 Woodlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 129
b. Design the Site to minimize Grading/soil disturbance in the vicinity of retained trees.
c. Provide for adequate and effective storm water management.
d. Design landscape installations to complement and honor retained trees.
6. In addition to protective fencing at the Critical Root Zone, a number of other construction techniques can help save trees. These include placing utilities under pavement instead of under trees; tunneling utilities under trees instead of trenching; using granular material when placing minimum amounts of Fill over roots; excavating by hand; and keeping heavy equipment and vehicle traffic away from the Critical Root Zone. Grading changes should not either increase or decrease moisture conditions in the Critical Root Zone.
7. Any protected Woodland that is determined by PSA Administrator to be dead, dying or severely damaged due to on-site construction activities within three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final permit approval for development authorized by an approved site plan, PUD site plan, or plat shall be replaced by the property owner in the amount specified in the requirements for mitigation of Woodlands If the site plan, PUD site plan, or plat has been compiled with, replacement shall be at the lesser rate. If the site plan, PUD site plan or plat has not been complied with, replacement shall be at the greater rate.

A replacement tree or a combination of trees of a species native to Michigan shall be provided to equal a minimum of 50% of the original DBH for each Woodland tree eight inches or larger that is removed. Replacement trees shall be non-sterile varieties. The minimum size of deciduous replacement tree shall be one inch caliper. The minimum size of an evergreen replacement tree shall be five feet in height. If more than 20 replacement trees are required, a mixture of three or more species must be used.
2. A replacement tree or a combination of trees of a species native to Michigan shall be provided to equal a minimum of 200% of the original DBH for each Woodland tree eight inches or larger that is removed without the approval required by this chapter.
3. Mitigation shall be provided on the same Site as the removed Woodland trees to the maximum extent feasible as space and long-term tree health allow. Where mitigation cannot be accomplished on the Site, all or part of the mitigation may be provided on public land within the City if approved as part of the site plan or plat.
4. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance.

5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.6 Landmark Trees
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 130
E. Guidelines for Best Mitigation Practices
1. When native forest fragments must be taken in whole or in part, they should be mitigated by the installation of replacement trees or by the creation of an area planted with a comparable plant association (trees, understory trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants - not including exotics) on the Site or elsewhere in the City.
2. Where a valuable native forest fragment must be partly destroyed by Development, the balance of the fragment should be actively managed as a natural area, to sustain it into the future. This includes the important task of controlling invasive exotics.
3. Urban Woodlands may also have considerable value to City residents. Development in them should be handled as sensitively as possible. Tree replacements for trees taken from such a Woodland should be replaced on the Site in a manner that complements the character of Woodland. Landscape design of the Site should also complement the character of the Woodland, and should be sensitive to screening and otherwise providing affected neighbors with pleasant views into the Site.
4. Care should be taken during the Development process to conserve topsoils which must be disturbed on site, and to install plant materials into optimum conditions. Compacted soils placed by heavy machines are not suitable for successful establishment of many types of plants. Retained topsoils can be used in new planting zones to great benefit.
5. Alternative mitigation plans which could be negotiated could include management or restoration of comparable Natural Features on the Site or on public lands elsewhere in the City, or donation of trees to the City to be planted on public land, donation of time and materials to assist the City in managing valuable natural areas on public land. Valuable Wetlands on the Site or elsewhere could be enhanced, storm water retention capacity could be increased, and Floodplain capacity and function could be improved -- each beyond that already required by code.
Landmark Trees
Large, old, picturesque, rare, well-located, or otherwise special and interesting trees play an important role in the character of individual properties, and in the fabric of the City as a whole. All the trees in the City together have positive effects on the climate of the City, on its ability to attract and sustain wildlife, and on its visual beauty.
A. Identification
1. Trees which qualify as Natural Features are, generally speaking, any tree larger than 24 inches in Diameter at Breast Height and any tree of a size listed on the Landmark Tree List (See Table 5.23-1).
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.6 Landmark Trees
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 131
2. Large trees in natural areas (native forest fragments or forested Wetlands or floodplain forest fragments) will often qualify as Landmark Trees.

C. Protection Priorities
1. Highest concern
The most important Landmark Trees to protect are ones which are rare, unusual, old or historically significant. Certain trees may play a special role in the visual resources of a Site or an area. If the trees are native to Ann Arbor (known to have grown here in 1824), they are particularly important to protect.
2. Midlevel concern
Trees which are mature, late succession species, provide wildlife habitat or visual screening, represent good diversity of species, have interesting flowers or other features, or are in proximity to a native forest fragment and are related to it.
3. Lowlevel concern
Pioneer species of Woody Plants arising on Sites with highly disturbed soils, trees and shrubs not native to the region and known to be invasive (seeding prolifically and naturalizing into the neighborhood or into natural areas). Generally speaking, a fine quality planted landscape can be more valuable in the long term, and more appealing to more people in the short term than many pioneer Woodlands in the City.
D. Protection Measures
1. All tree roots are vulnerable to disturbance, and some species are more so than others. All construction activity (including the effects on soil moisture and drainage of Grading changes in the area) should be excluded from the Critical Root Zone of trees to be preserved according to submitted plans. These activities should be avoided to prevent and minimize damage or destruction of tree roots, threatening the life of trees: Soil compaction from vehicle and machine parking and traffic, excavation or Filling, storage of materials, Grading changes that affect soil moisture in the root zone at any time, and insensitive landscape design and installation techniques (including irrigation).
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.6 Landmark Trees
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 134
2. Activities which help prevent and minimize damage or destruction to roots are encouraged, including the placement of utilities under pavement instead of under trees; tunneling utilities under trees instead of trenching; using granular material when placing modest amounts of soil over roots; excavating by hand; and keeping equipment and vehicles away from the Critical Root Zone.
3. Barrier fencing shall be installed at the limits of the Critical Root Zone for Landmark Trees. Barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until authorized to be removed. No filling, excavating, storage or trespass by Person or machine shall take place within the fenced area.
4. Any protected Landmark Trees that are determined by PSA Administrator to be dead, dying or severely damaged due to on-site construction activities within three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final permit approval for development authorized by an approved site plan, PUD site plan, or plat shall be replaced by the property owner in the amount specified in the requirements for mitigation of Landmark Trees. If the site plan, PUD site plan, or plat has been compiled with, replacement shall be at the lesser rate. If the site plan, PUD site plan or plat has not been complied with, replacement shall be at the greater rate.
E. Mitigation.
1. A replacement tree or a combination of trees of a species native to Michigan shall be provided to equal a minimum of 50% of the original DBH for each Landmark Tree that is removed. Replacement trees shall be non-sterile varieties. The minimum size of deciduous replacement tree shall be one inch caliper. The minimum size of an evergreen replacement tree shall be five feet in height. If more than 20 replacement trees are required, a mixture of three or more species must be used.
2. A replacement tree or a combination of trees of a species native to Michigan shall be provided to equal a minimum of 200% of the original DBH for each Landmark Tree that is removed without the approval required by this chapter.
3. Mitigation shall be provided on the same Site as the removed Landmark Trees to the maximum extent feasible as space and long-term tree health allow. Where mitigation cannot be accomplished on the Site, all or part of the mitigation may be provided on public land within the City if approved as part of the site plan or plat.
4. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristics of the plant communities of the area before disturbance.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.7 Steep Slopes
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 135
F. Guidelines for Best Mitigation Practices
1. Required or desired replacement should include the most appropriate, non-invasive species as part of the project design. Replacement requirements include using species native to Michigan, and a diversity of species in a range of sizes. Where trees are taken from a natural area, it is the natural area which should be replaced or restored at some other location- involving much more than just tree planting. Trees which go into such a project may need to be smaller in size to find enough of the species needed to make a viable start to creating an ecosystem.
2. Replacement trees need a chance to become as great as the trees they replace. Genuine concern for soils and cultural needs of new plants should be a part of the design process. Many species of trees will never thrive in compacted, Fill soils or in conditions not suitable for their optimum growth. Recognition of these realities is critical to successful replacement.
3. Where it is not possible to install the number of trees required, alternate mitigation plans may be developed - including active management or restoration of natural areas on the Site, planting of trees on public land elsewhere in the City, additional storm water controls beyond that required and of help with flooding conditions on the Site or in the watershed, donation of public land on the Site or elsewhere, etc.
Steep Slopes
Steep Slopes in Ann Arbor are found on the sides of moraines, kames, and ravines, and the eroded valleys of waterways.
Steep Slopes are prone to Erosion if the vegetation on them is disturbed, or if surface runoff is directed toward them or down them. As a result, disturbed slopes often result in deposition of soils in Watercourses and on the land below. Hydrologic functions such as infiltration, frequency and volume of discharges, and impacts of the proposed Development upon water resources on and off site must be considered.
The City's Steep Slopes still often retain on them or adjacent to them various Wetlands, prairiesavannas, rare species, Floodplains, Watercourses, and the City's largest areas of native forest fragments. Steep Slopes with native forest fragments or other overlapping Natural Features have high natural and scenic value.
Scenic values are measurable. Each Site can be quantified for its relative overall scenic value as viewed from vista points off the Site. Steep slopes, especially those in the Huron River Valley still covered by native forest fragments, are the most important natural scenic assets of the City. Vistas of unbroken native forest tree Canopy, visible on Steep Slopes and moraine tops, are vital to maintain across the City.
A. Identification
1. Steep Slopes are naturally occurring landforms with a vertical change in elevation of ten feet or more, a slope of 20% or more, and a length of
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.7 Steep Slopes
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 136
50 feet or more, measured parallel to the contour lines. They were identified on the "Map of Steep Slopes of Ann Arbor, 2004." Most Steep Slopes in the City occur in the Huron River corridor or along its tributaries.
2. Also shown on the map are zones 3,000 feet each way from the centerline of the Huron River, and zones 500 feet each way from the centerlines of the tributary streams in the City. These zones encompass the great majority of Steep Slopes in the City, and are an initial approximation of the areas in which there are likely to be both other Natural Features of high concern and slopes of high visual sensitivity.
B. Protection Priorities
1. Highest concern
a. Extremely Steep Slopes of 40% or greater anywhere in the City are of highest concern. These are predominantly adjacent to the River and typically also include one or more other Natural Features.
b. Steep Slopes of 20% or greater that are within 3,000 feet of the Huron River or within 500 feet of its open or historic tributaries and that: a) have native forest fragments or other high quality Natural Features in addition to the Steep Slope; or b) serve as a source of water for adjacent or connected water features; are of highest concern.
c. These Natural Features need to be sustained and cared for as natural areas. In the event the public benefits of a proposed Development in an area of highest concern are deemed to outweigh the benefits of maintaining it as a protected natural area, the project shall meet the highest standards of mid-level concern. When Steep Slopes are considered for Development the impact on the City's visual character shall be considered, and negative impacts minimized in the approval process.
2. Midlevel concern
a. Steep Slopes within 3,000 feet of the Huron River or within 500 feet of its open or historic tributaries that do not meet the criteria for highest concern are of midlevel concern.
b. The landform and vegetation on these slopes must be disturbed to the least extent possible. The visual integrity of the Site in relation to adjacent areas should be maintained. The techniques for Erosion and water protection described for low-level Steep Slopes shall be followed.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.7 Steep Slopes
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 137
3. Low-level concern
a. Steep Slopes not within 3,000 feet of the Huron River or within 500 feet of its open or historic tributaries are of low-level concern.
b. Development on Steep Slopes requires special techniques to prevent soil Erosion and to protect water resources. A study of ground and surface water flows of the Site may be required to understand possible on- and off-site impacts of a proposed Development on the water resources. Landscape work on these Sites should be designed to restore native ecologies, to reduce storm water runoff, to enhance infiltration, to increase flood storage capacity, to allow only clean water to exit the Site, and to honor natural linkages and natural areas and adjacent water features. Soils must not be permitted to wash from these Sites under any circumstances.
c. The Site's design should incorporate the slopes so that the Development complements the character of the landforms, vegetation and topography. Any Development must meet all the standards for any other Natural Features of the Site.
C. Protection Measures
1. Barrier fencing shall be installed at the Limits of Soil Disturbance adjacent to Steep Slopes. Barrier fencing shall be a minimum of four feet in height and shall remain in place in good condition until it is authorized to be removed. No filling, excavating or storage of materials, Debris or equipment shall take place within the fenced area.
2. Protection measures must be in place before landform or vegetation disturbance to prevent any off-site damage. Any damage to waterways or off-site locations from Erosion must be promptly repaired to the fullest extent practical, using best management techniques. A heavy rain event is not an excuse for such damage to occur. Collateral damage during and after construction to Canopy trees on scenically important Sites must be scrupulously avoided (it will take 150 years to replace any unintended losses). Plans presented for Development on Steep Slopes must reflect sound analysis of scenic values, must show very serious concern for soil Erosion controls, and have very carefully crafted limits of disturbance lines, and must indicate procedures whereby all contractors, subcontractors, owners and inspectors are fully and continuously informed of the values on the Site that must be protected, without errors.
3. Great attention should be exercised in the approval and inspection process regarding the design of drainage systems, roads and paved surfaces, retaining walls, and the means by which the entire project will actually be constructed, to avoid collateral, unintended damage. The use of retaining walls can reduce the amount of Grading
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.7 Steep Slopes
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 138
necessary, but are not encouraged (they are rarely durable structures). If retaining walls are proposed, the use of walls that incorporate vegetation are encouraged to improve aesthetics. Underground utilities should not be located in Steep Slopes and should not run lengthwise along them. Drainage should be directed to inlet structures and not be permitted to flow down slopes during and after construction.
4. The primary goal in protecting Steep Slopes is to prevent Erosion and subsequent damage to Natural Features on and off the Site. Underground utilities should not be located in Steep Slopes, and should not run lengthwise along them. Drainage should be directed to inlet structures and not be permitted to flow down slopes during and after construction.
5. Protection measures for other Natural Features placed at risk by intrusion onto a Steep Slope should be designed and implemented in such a way that risk of damage to the Natural Features involved is the minimum possible. These provisions may need to be significantly more strenuous than those which might be implemented for the same Natural Features on flat ground.
D. Mitigation
Disturbed areas of Steep Slopes shall approximate the natural terrain and be planted with native vegetation at the completion of construction. No new drainage may be directed over areas of disturbed slope. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance. The density and coverage of vegetation (except trees) shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting.
E. Guidelines for Best Mitigation Practices
1. If any portion of a high or mid-level concern Steep Slope must be disturbed as part of an approved project, then the balance of the Steep Slope area must be protected from disturbance during construction and it must be managed/restored as a natural area thereafter. This means considerable attention will be paid to herbaceous, understory, and Canopy flora. The built landscape around any approved Buildings shall use minimum Impervious Surface, and shall be very complementary to the adjoining natural area. Roof water on the Site and other surface rainwater drainage systems on the Site are to be designed to infiltrate to groundwater (where possible) in such a way as to approximate infiltration on the site prior to the project (runoff from roads may need cleaning first). The use of green Roofs are encouraged to reduce runoff. The design of the Building and its location on the Site should not diminish the views of or character of the views of the Site, i.e. removal of a closed native forest Canopy.
2. Change to any Natural Features on a Steep Slope Site must meet the mitigation standards for those Natural Features. Replacement
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.8 Watercourses
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 139
materials, techniques, and long-term maintenance routines required as mitigation should serve to restore the visual character of the Site.
3. Follow-up monitoring may be required in some instances for a period of time related to the duration of the restoration work or recovery from damage.
Watercourses
The preeminent Natural Feature in the City is the Huron River, its tributaries, and the glacial landforms and topography which embrace them.
These Watercourses bring water to and through a property and, together, create vital wildlife corridors through the City. They are key components of scenic beauty and of outdoor attraction for people in the City, and on many individual properties. They also serve the practical function of providing drinking water, either directly (the City's main water supply intakes are in Barton Pond) or indirectly by the primary conduits of ground water recharge.
The Huron River is the main Watercourse through the City. Other Watercourses in the City are tributaries and subtributaries of the Huron River. Many parts of streams and some entire streams no longer exist above ground. They have been placed underground in storm pipes (e.g., Allen Creek). Most of the remaining tributaries are in poor condition because they have been overwhelmed by the increased runoff generated by Development of the City.
Construction of structures in Watercourses and bottomlands of lakes and ponds is regulated by state statute, under permits issued by the Department of Environmental Quality. The purpose of state requirements are to minimize dredging and filling in Watercourses and in bottom lands, to minimize negative impacts which result from necessary activities of this sort, and (in the case of Wetlands which are associated with these projects) replace the lost resources.
A. Identification
Many streams and bodies of water qualifying as Watercourses and bottomlands will be visible on aerial photographs and maps, many small ponds and the uppermost reaches of some streams may not. These features are readily identifiable in the field. Watercourses are clearly delineated on Floodplain maps. In the upper reaches of watersheds too small for those maps to have been done, Watercourses can and should be identified as the top of the bank of the channel carrying water or as the ordinary high water mark line of a pond. Streams in the City may cross relatively steep terrain, and are likely to be combined with other valuable Natural Features, including valuable Woodlands, Wetlands and Floodplains.
B. Protection Priorities
It is in the City's best interest to protect Watercourses in as natural a condition as possible, and to control storm water in watersheds in such a way that Watercourses are not damaged and eroded during storm events. While storm water is also regulated by this chapter, the design of many elements on each Site directly determines the way water is handled and what impacts it will have both on and off the Site.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.8 Watercourses
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 140
1. Highest concern
Watercourses with natural areas around them (Wetlands or native forest fragments), Watercourses integrated into steep terrain, and Watercourses still flowing in natural channels should be preserved as part of any Development proposal. Crossing locations should be kept to the minimum necessary to provide access. Wide buffers should be provided to maintain a corridor for wildlife along stream ways. Where streams in these conditions exist on a Site, they are likely the most important design element of the Site. The design should capitalize on the value of these features and sustain them.
2. Midlevel concern
Urbanized aboveground Watercourses are ones that no longer have much of a natural character, but have not been placed into a storm drain beneath the ground. Whenever possible, Development should restore these Watercourses and associated Natural Features and take advantage of them as a design amenity. Effort to control Erosion, sedimentation, and contamination problems is strongly encouraged, as is the connection of natural corridors across properties.
3. Low-level concern
Where Watercourses are already underground, Floodplain capacity and function are the main concern. Restoration of the surface Watercourse is encouraged, particularly if the effort can assist in storm water control.
C. Protection Measures
1. A Natural Feature buffer area within a line measured 25 feet horizontally from the ordinary high water mark of a Watercourse shall be provided adjacent to a Watercourse and maintained in relation to the entire Watercourse as a Natural Feature unless, and to the extent, it is determined to be in the public interest not to maintain such area under the standards provided in Section 5.29.4.
2. Prohibited and permitted activities for the Natural Feature buffer area shall be the same as the prohibited and permitted activities regulated or allowed in or on the Watercourse, unless prohibited activity is determined to be in the public interest and authorization has been granted by the Planning Commission under the standards provided in Section 5.29.4 .
D. Mitigation.
Mitigation for disturbance of Watercourses shall be provided according to the requirements of a valid permit from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality in accordance with the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance. The density and coverage of vegetation (except trees) shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.9 Wetlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 141
E. Guidelines for Best Mitigation Practices.
Watercourses should be crossed at the location where there is the least physical, scenic, and biological impact upon the Watercourse and its surrounding Natural Features. If surrounding Natural Features must be disturbed to facilitate the crossing, they should be mitigated as prescribed in this section and by other code requirements.
Wetlands
A. Purpose
1. Preservation and enhancement of Wetlands is essential to maintaining and improving the City's aesthetic character, its ecological stability, its economic well-being, its educational opportunities, and its quality of life.
2. Wetlands are protected to help reduce damage to aquatic resources from Erosion, turbidity, siltation, and contamination. They are protected to minimize the loss of native plants and animals, to help preserve biological diversity and to minimize the loss of wildlife habitat within the City, and to sustain many benefits Wetlands can help provide - including flood control, stormwater storage and release, ground water recharge, and water quality improvement.
B. Identification
Wetlands may be visible in low altitude aerial photos, particularly older ones prior to the invasion by exotic shrubs and trees. A map of potential Wetland areas is on file in the City Planning Department. The boundaries of Wetlands shall be determined by considering vegetation and soils in the field.
1. The physical boundary and extent of Wetlands shall be identified by a professional having technical ability and experience sufficient to accurately identify Wetland boundaries.
2. Wetland determination shall be made using the same criteria as provided for Part 303 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, and administrative rules as amended.
3. To facilitate verification, the boundary of the Wetland shall be flagged in the field by the Applicant prior to the application for a Wetland Use Permit.
C. Protection Priorities
1. Highest Concern
Large Wetland complexes, forested Wetlands, and Wetlands along Watercourses, with native plant associations still intact or regenerating. These habitats should be carefully protected from Development and from effects of Development (no change in hydrology). In general, Wetlands with important native ecosystems cannot tolerate use as retention basins for storm water runoff from developed areas. A separate filter and retention system should be developed, so that impacts upon the Wetland are minimal.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.9 Wetlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 142
2. Midlevel Concern
Disturbed Wetlands with underlying hydric soils, such as on once farmed lands, constitute genuine opportunity to restore some of the capacity and function and diversity of species removed from the City over the last 100 years. Maintaining and enhancing the biological and hydrological value and function of these Wetlands should be the primary concern. Use of these Wetlands as retention basins may be acceptable, as long as there are separate filtration basins and as long as the volumes of water involved do not overwhelm the plant life which must be sustained in the Wetland.
3. Low-level Concern
Low quality Wetlands are those that have been greatly damaged, have been reduced to open water and/or a few species of plants, or are dominated by Invasive Species. Replacement or relocation of these Wetlands is more acceptable, if they must be taken for Development. In many cases, these Wetlands can be effectively repaired and used for storm water retention and filtration.
D. Protection Measures
1. A Natural Feature buffer area within a line measured 25 feet horizontally from the boundary or edge of a Wetland identified as provided above shall be required unless, and of the extent, it is determined to be in the public interest not to maintain such area under the standards provided in Section 5.29.4.
2. Prohibited and permitted activities for the Natural Feature buffer area shall be the same as the prohibited and permitted activities regulated or allowed in or on the Wetland, unless prohibited activity is determined to be in the public interest and authorization has been granted by the Planning Commission under the standards provided in Section 5.29.4.
3. Where Wetlands are to be used as a part of a storm water retention system, the Rules of the Washtenaw County Water Resources Commissioner should be followed to minimize negative impacts on the Wetland.
E. Protection of Wetlands during and after construction
An Applicant who has received a Wetland Use Permit under this chapter shall comply with the requirements of this section in connection with any construction or other activity on the property for which the use permit has been issued. Conditions may be established by the City to ensure that the intent of this chapter is carried out. The activity or use shall be conducted in such manner as to cause the least amount of disruption of the protected Wetland, including but not limited to the following requirements:
1. Prior to any Development, Clearing, filling, or other activity for which a Wetland Use Permit is required, protective construction fencing intended to restrict access shall be erected between the protected area and the area subject to Development. Such protection shall remain until
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.9 Wetlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 143
it is authorized to be removed by the City, or until issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Nails, wires, or other objects may not be attached to any tree, nor otherwise cause damage to any tree.
2. All protected Wetland and Watercourse areas within or adjacent to the Wetland Use Permit activity area shall be protected with barrier fencing at least four feet in height, staked in place at ten-foot (minimum) intervals. No filling, excavating, or storage of materials, Debris, or equipment shall take place within the barrier fencing.
3. Where vehicle and Driveway access is permitted, any existing hydrological connection shall not be disrupted.
4. When the use of Fill is permitted, it shall be clean and free of garbage, refuse, toxic or contaminated material, or any material that through the action of leaching may cause degradation of surface or ground water quality.
5. Soil Erosion control structures and measures shall be maintained, including but not limited to silt fences, straw bale berms, and Sediment traps. The owner shall provide for periodic inspections and maintenance of such installations throughout the duration of the project.
6. A copy of the City Wetland Use Permit and state permits, if applicable, shall be prominently displayed or available at the Site. They shall be displayed continuously when authorized activities are conducted and for ten days following completion. The owner shall allow City representatives to enter and inspect the Premises at any reasonable time, and failure to allow inspections shall constitute a violation of this section.
F. Mitigation

As authorized by Section 5:211(4)(b) of this chapter, the City may impose conditions on a Wetland Use Permit for a use or development if the conditions are designed to remove an impairment to the Wetland benefits, to mitigate the impact of a discharge of Fill material, or otherwise improve the water quality.
2. The City shall consider a mitigation plan if submitted by the Applicant and may incorporate the mitigation actions as permit conditions for the improvement of the existing Wetland resources or the creation of a new Wetland resource to offset Wetland resource losses resulting from the proposed project. Financial assurances may be required to ensure that mitigation is accomplished as specified by the permit conditions. The City shall, when requested by the Applicant, meet with the Applicant to review the Applicant's mitigation plan.
3. In developing conditions to mitigate impacts, the City shall consider mitigation to apply only to unavoidable impacts that are otherwise permissible, utilizing the criteria under Part 303 of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended. Mitigation shall not be considered when it is feasible and prudent to
Article IV: Development Standards
5.23 Natural Features| 5.23.9 Wetlands
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 144
avoid impacts or when the impacts would be otherwise prohibited under this chapter.
4. When considering mitigation proposals, the City shall make all of the following determinations:
a. That all feasible and prudent efforts have been made to avoid the loss of Wetland resource values.
b. That all practical means have been considered to minimize impacts.
c. That it is practical to replace the Wetland resource values which will be unavoidably impacted.
5. If the City determines that it is practical to replace the Wetland resource values which will be unavoidably impacted, the City shall consider all of the following criteria when reviewing an Applicant's mitigation proposal:
a. Mitigation shall be provided on-site where practical and beneficial to the Wetland resources.
b. When subdivision (a) of this subsection does not apply, mitigation shall be provided in the immediate vicinity of the permitted activity where practical to the Wetland resources, provided that mitigation shall be within the same sub-watershed of the Huron River within which the proposed Wetland use is located (i.e., the Allen Creek, Fleming Creek, Honey Creek, Malletts Creek, Miller Creek, Swift Run Drain or Traver Creek sub-watersheds). If the proposed Wetland use is not within one of the foregoing sub-watersheds, then mitigation may be within the Huron River direct discharge area, provided that mitigation in the Huron River direct discharge area shall be within the City limits or within one mile upstream of the City limits. Mitigation upstream of the proposed Wetland use is preferred.
c. Only when it has been determined by the Public Services Area Administrator that subdivisions (a) and (b) of this subsection are inappropriate and impractical shall mitigation be considered elsewhere.
d. Any proposal shall assure that, upon completion, there will be no net loss to the Wetland resources. Any mitigation plan approved under this chapter shall provide replacement of Wetlands disturbed at a ratio of no less than 1.5:1 and no more than 2:1, in accordance with federal rules and state operating procedures. Should such rules and procedures change, the most current ratio shall be used.
e. The proposal shall give consideration to replacement of the predominant functional values lost within the impacted Wetland.

5.24 Signs| 5.24.1 Intent
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 145
6. Any mitigation activity shall be completed before initiation of other permitted activities, unless a phased concurrent schedule is agreed upon between the City and the Applicant.
7. Monitoring to establish documentation of the functional performance of the mitigation may be required as a permit condition, as well as necessary corrective actions required, to deliver the Wetland resource values identified.
8. Disturbed areas to be reestablished shall be planted with species native to Michigan and characteristic of the plant communities of the area before disturbance. The density and coverage of vegetation (except trees) shall be such that it will approximate the density and coverage before disturbance within three years of planting.
5.24 Signs
Throughout this Section all references to the Citys sign regulation or to this Section 5.24 refer to and apply to both the substantive standards in this Section 5.24 and the procedural standards related to the administration and enforcement of sign regulations in Article V: Administrative Bodies and Procedures.
Intent
The intent of Section 5.24 is to regulate Signs within all zoning districts of the City to protect public safety, health, and welfare; minimize abundance and size of Signs to reduce visual clutter and motorist distraction; promote public convenience; preserve property values; and enhance the aesthetic appearance and quality of life within the City. The regulations and standards in this Section are considered the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve a substantial governmental interest for public safety, traffic safety, aesthetics, and protection of property values, and are intended to be content neutral. Those objectives are accomplished by establishing the minimum amount of regulations necessary concerning the size, placement, construction, Illumination, and other aspects of Signs in the City so as to:
A. Protect the public right to receive messages, especially noncommercial messages, such as religious, political, economic, social, philosophical, and other types of information protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the expression of free speech protected by the First Amendment.
B. Recognize that the principal intent of commercial Signs, to meet the purpose of these standards and serve the public interest, should be for identification of an Business on the same Premises as the Sign.
C. Recognize that the proliferation of Signs is unduly distracting to motorists and nonmotorized travelers, reduces the effectiveness of Signs directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform traffic flow, and creates potential for accidents.
Article IV: Development Standards
5.24 Signs| 5.24.2 Applicability
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 146
D. Recognize that different areas of the City require different Sign regulations due to factors such as their intended audience and their ability to help promote the character of an area.
E. Prevent Signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies or disrepair.
F. Enable the public to locate goods, services, Buildings, and/or locations on which activities occur without excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of Signs.
G. Prevent placement of Signs that will conceal or obscure other Signs.
H. Prevent Off-Premises Signs from conflicting with land uses.
I. Preserve and improve the appearance of the City and road corridors through the City by encouraging Signs of consistent type and size that are compatible with and complementary with related Buildings and uses, and harmonious with their surroundings.
J. Prohibit portable commercial Signs in recognition of their significant negative impact on traffic safety and aesthetics.
Applicability
Signs may be erected or maintained in the City only as permitted by this Section 5.24 and subject to other restrictions contained in this Code. The Sign regulations of this Section are intended to ensure that Signs are located, designed, sized, constructed, installed, and maintained in a way that protects and promotes safety, health, aesthetics, and the public welfare while allowing adequate communication. If any portion of the Sign regulations of this Section is determined to be a violation of law, that portion shall be severed from the remainder of the chapter and shall be revised to reflect the least possible change that avoids the violation of law; and the remainder of this Section shall remain in effect and be interpreted as closely as possible to the original intent of this Section without violating state or federal law. It is the specific intent of the City that if any portion of the Sign regulations of this Section is determined to be an impermissible content-based regulation, such a determination shall not result in the invalidation of any other portion of this Section. Regardless of any other provision in this Section, noncommercial messages may be placed or substituted on any lawfully permitted Sign.

Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 246
Article VI: Nonconformities
5.31 Purpose Statement
It is the intent of this Article VI to recognize that the eventual elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of existing uses or Structures that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this chapter. It is also the intent of this Article VI that any elimination of Nonconforming Uses or Nonconforming Structures shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.
5.32 General Standards
Nonconforming Use
A Nonconforming Use may be continued and shall be maintained in good condition, but it shall not be:
A. Changed to another non-conforming use, except, after approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. When granting such approval, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine that such change in use will have a less detrimental effect on neighboring property than the existing non-conforming use.
B. Structurally altered so as to prolong the life of the Building.
C. Expanded or increased in intensity of use (for example, such as by the addition of one or more Dwelling Units, by providing additional Manufacturing or selling area, or the addition of facilities that would allow the establishment of another use or other uses).
D. Re-established after discontinuance for a period of at least one year.
E. Re-established in cases of residential usage in any "R" dwelling district after damage or destruction of the Building or Structure devoted to such non-conforming use if the estimated expense of reconstruction exceeds 70% of the appraised replacement cost (as determined by the Building Official) of the entire Building or Structure exclusive of foundations, prior to its damage or destruction. In cases of other than residential usage in any "R" dwelling district, the limitation on the expense of reconstruction shall be 50% of such appraised replacement cost.
F. Re-established in any zoning district other than an "R" dwelling district except under the same provisions as in Subsection A.5 above, providing that the limitation on the expense of reconstruction shall be 70% rather than 50% of the appraised replacement cost (as determined by the Building Official) of the entire Building or Structure exclusive of foundations prior to its damage or destruction.
Nonconforming Structure
A Nonconforming Structure may be maintained or restored, but no Alteration shall be made to a Nonconforming Structure unless one of the following conditions is met:
Article VI: Nonconformities
5.32 General Standards| 5.32.3 Nonconforming Lot
Effective Date: November 17, 2019 Page 247
A. The Alteration is approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals upon a finding that it complies as nearly as practicable with the requirements of this chapter and that it will not have a detrimental effect on neighboring property.
B. The Alteration is approved by the Planning Manager upon a finding that it conforms to all the requirements of this chapter and is made to a Building which will be a Single-Family Dwelling on completion of the Alteration and is located in an R1, R2, R3 or R4 district.
C. For purposes of this Section 5.32.2, Alteration shall mean any change in a Building that results in additional Floor Area being fit for occupancy, a greater number of dwelling or rooming units or an increase in the exterior dimensions of the Building.
D. A Nonconforming Structure shall not be replaced after damage or destruction of the Nonconforming Structure if the estimated expense of reconstruction exceeds 75% of the appraised value, as determined by the Building Official, of the entire Building or Structure, exclusive of foundations.
Nonconforming Lot
