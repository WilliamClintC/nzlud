PREFACE 
    The Wheeling, Illinois Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1965, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Paul E. Hamer, City Attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 13, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 5266, passed May 20, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 13, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "point numbering system". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Title 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS* 
Chapter 1.04 - CODE 

1.04.001 - Adoption. 
    The Municipal Code of Wheeling, heretofore printed in book form pursuant to the authority of the corporate authorities is hereby adopted and published by the authority of the corporate authorities. 
(Ord. 836 § 1, 1966) 
1.04.010 - Title and citation. 
    This code shall be known as the Municipal Code of Wheeling. Any reference to the number of any section contained herein shall be understood to refer to the position of the same under its appropriate chapter heading, its title heading if any, and to the penalty clause relating thereto, as well as to the section itself, when reference is made to this code by title in any legal document or ordinance of the village. (1956 Code § 487) 
1.04.020 - Construction of words. 
    Whenever any word in any section of this code importing the plural number is used in describing or referring to any matters, parties or persons, any single matter, party or person shall be deemed to be included, although distributive words may not have been used. When any subject matter, party or person is referred to in this code by words importing the singular number only, or the masculine gender, several matters, parties or persons and females as well as males and bodies corporate shall be deemed to be included. The words "person, firm or corporation," shall be deemed to include any association or organization of any kind. Words in the present shall include the future. The words "this code" whenever used in this code shall be held and taken to mean the entire code, including each and every section thereof. The word "village" whenever used in this code shall be held and taken to mean the village of Wheeling. The words "written" and "in writing" may include printing. Provided that these rules of construction shall not be applied to any section of this code which contains any express provisions excluding such construction or where the subject matter or content of such section may be repugnant thereto. (1956 Code § 488) 
1.04.030 - Distinction between wholesaler and retailer. 
    In all cases where the words "wholesaler" or "wholesale dealer" are used in this code, unless otherwise specifically defined, they shall be understood to relate to the sale of goods, merchandise, articles or things in quantity to persons who purchase for the purpose of resale, as distinguished from a retail dealer who sells in smaller quantities direct to the consumer. (1956 Code § 489) 
1.04.035 - Penalties for violating code provisions. 
    Whenever in this code the doing of any act or the omission to do any act constitutes a breach of any section or provision of this code, and there shall be no fine or penalty declared for such breach, any person who shall be convicted of such breach shall be fined not less than thirty-five dollars not more than five hundred dollars for each offense. When applicable, each day during which a violation is permitted to exist shall be considered a separate and distinct offense. 
    Whenever any fine, charge, penalty or payment is due pursuant to any provision in this code and is not paid after the village sends, mails or otherwise delivers notice (unless a different period is stated elsewhere in this code) to the person responsible for such fine, charge, penalty or payment (the "responsible person"), the village may transfer such fine, charge, penalty or payment to a private collection agency of the village's choosing or to an attorney for collection purposes. Any such collection agency or attorney shall, for purposes of collection of such fine, charge, penalty or payment, be deemed an agent of the village. All costs or attorneys' fees incurred by the village for the collection of any fines, charges, penalties or payments transferred to any such collection agency or attorney shall be assessed against the responsible person as an additional fine, charge, penalty or payment, subject to any applicable statutory limits.

1.04.040 - References to officers and employees. 
    Whenever reference is made in this code to a village officer or employee by title only, this shall be construed as though followed by the words "of the village of Wheeling" and shall be taken to mean the officer or employee of this village having the title mentioned or performing the duties indicated. 
    No provision of this code designating the duties of any officer or employee shall be so construed as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine or penalty provided in this code for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of the village board to impose such a fine or penalty on such officer or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty. (1956 Code § 491)

(1956 Code § 493) 
1.04.070 - Effect of amendments on penalty clauses. 
    In case of amendment of any section of this code containing the provisions for which a penalty is provided in another section, the penalty so provided in such other shall be held to relate to the amended section or the amending section, whether re-enacted in the amendatory ordinance or not, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. (1956 Code § 494) 
1.04.080 - Recording amendments.

    The village clerk shall also keep a separate book containing every amendment or addition passed to this code, with a reference on each copy of such amendment or addition as to the place in the record of ordinances where the original ordinance may be found.

If any penalty, forfeiture or punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such provision may, by consent of the party affected, be applied to any judgment announced after the new ordinance takes effect. 
    This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or implication, whether the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions upon the same subject or any other ordinance.

3.  Parties shall be served with process in a manner reasonably calculated to give them actual notice including, as appropriate, personal service of process upon a party or its employer or agent; service by mail at a party's address; or notice that is posted upon the property where the violation is found where the party is the owner or manager of the property. 
4.  The violation report form shall be forwarded to the appropriate ordinance enforcement and code hearing administrator where a docket number shall be stamped on all copies of the report and a hearing date shall be noted in the blank spaces provided for that purpose on the form. 
5.  The hearing date shall be scheduled with reasonable promptness, provided that, except for an emergency situation, if requested by the defendant, he shall have at least fifteen days after service to prepare for the hearing. If service is provided by mail, the fifteen-day period shall begin to run on the date the notice is deposited in the mail. 
6.  One copy of the violation report form shall be maintained in the files of the ordinance enforcement and code hearing administrator and shall be part of the record of hearing. 
7.  One copy of the report form shall be returned to the individual representing the village in the case so that he or she may prepare evidence of the Code violation for presentation at the hearing on the date indicated.

10.  In the case of a building code violation only, if the name of the property owner cannot be ascertained or if service on the owner cannot be made by mail, service may be made on the owner by posting or nailing a copy of the violation report form on the front door of the structure where the violation is found, not less than twenty days before the hearing is scheduled. 
11.  Any ordinance violation notice issued, signed and served in accordance herewith or a copy of the notice, shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice and shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceeding.

2.03.140 - Practice-Generally. 
(a)  Quorum. The presence of four members of the corporate authorities shall constitute a quorum at any meeting. 
(b)  Motions. No motion shall be put unless it is seconded. Neither the maker nor seconder of a motion shall be required to vote in favor of the motion. 
(c)  Withdrawal of Motions-Seconds. The maker of a motion may withdraw it any time before the commencement of the vote, without the approval of the seconder. The seconder may thereupon renew the motion and seek a new seconder; if the seconder does not renew the motion, any other trustee may then do so. A seconder of a motion may withdraw his second at any time before the commencement of the vote. 
(d)  Amendment of Motions. The maker of a motion may amend his motion, with the concurrence of the seconder, at any time prior to the commencement of the vote. No motion may be otherwise amended, except the motions to amend an ordinance, resolution, contract or other written proposition shall, if adopted, amend any pending motions to pass or adopt the written proposition. 
(e)  (1)  Motions to Amend and to Fill Blanks. A motion to amend an amendment shall be in order, but one to amend an amendment to an amendment shall not be entertained. 
(2)  An amendment modifying the intention of a proposition shall be in order; but an amendment not germane to the subject of the pending proposition shall not be in order. 
(3)  On an amendment to "strike out and insert," the paragraph to be amended shall first be read as it stands, then the words proposed to be stricken out, then those to be inserted, and finally the paragraph as it will stand if so amended shall be read. 
(f)  Division of Questions. A question which is divisible shall be divided upon a motion to divide adopted by the corporate authorities, and not otherwise. A question shall be divisible only if it contains more than one distinct proposition, and only if all of the divided propositions are each capable of complete and independent adoption or passage. However, no ordinance shall be divisible. 
(g)  Motion to Substitute. A substitute for any original proposition under debate or for any pending amendment to such proposition may be entertained by motion. If accepted by the corporate authorities by vote, the substitute motion shall entirely supersede such original proposition or amendment, as the case may be. 
(h)  Reconsideration. (1) A vote or question may be reconsidered at any time during the same meeting, or at the first regular meeting held thereafter. A vote or question may be reconsidered or a matter rescinded at a special meeting held prior to the next regular meeting but only if there are present at such special meeting as many members of the corporate authorities as were present when the original vote was taken. Where a motion to reconsider is made at the same meeting as the passage of the original motion it may be postpone to a later date certain. 
(2)  A motion for reconsideration having been made and decided in the negative or tabled shall not be renewed, nor shall a motion to reconsider be reconsidered. 
(3)  No motion to reconsider the approval or denial of the recommendation of an advisory body required by law to hold public hearings shall be entertained except at the same meeting at which the original action was taken or after the matter has been conferred to the advisory body for a further hearing and recommendation. 
(4)  A motion to reconsider must be made by a trustee who voted on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered. However, where a voice vote was taken then any trustee may move to reconsider such vote; and where a motion has received a majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground that a greater number of affirmative votes is required for its passage or adoption, then a motion to reconsider may be made only by those who voted in the affirmative on such question to be reconsidered. Any trustee may second a motion to reconsider. Any vote upon a motion to reconsider a roll call vote shall also be by roll call vote. 
(i)  Rescinding and Repeal. No resolution or other written proposition shall be subsequently rescinded except by adoption of a written resolution or other written proposition. No ordinance or provision of an ordinance shall be repealed except by a subsequent ordinance which expressly and specifically effects such repeal. No ordinance shall be construed to repeal any previous ordinance by implication, notwithstanding any inconsistency or conflict between them; in such cases, the subsequent ordinance shall supersede the prior ordinance and shall govern those situations to which it is applicable to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency, and the prior ordinance provisions shall remain applicable to all other situations, circumstances and applications as to which it has not been superseded.

Every trustee shall vote aye or nay on every roll call, and shall not abstain unless he or she declares a conflict of interest, as defined under state law and the village ordinances. A trustee who does not vote, or who requests an abstention without announcing a de jure conflict of interest shall be recorded, at the conclusion of the roll call, voting with the majority on the particular question. 
(d)  Effect of Not Voting. Except for instances of de jure conflicts of interest, and except for a motion to appeal the ruling of the president, failure or refusal to vote by a trustee in attendance shall constitute concurrence in the vote of the majority.

(c)  Referring and Discharging. Any matter may be referred to a committee, whereupon the matter shall not be considered by the corporate authorities until the committee reports, or until the corporate authorities discharge the committee from further consideration of the subject matter. No committee may be discharged unless the motion to discharge is included on the agenda. 
(d)  Reporting. The committee of the whole need not report in writing. Special committees shall report in writing whenever they make recommendations for final official action on a matter, and the report shall specifically state the recommended action if such action is not reduced to a proposed resolution or ordinance. Members of special committees may issue minority or concurring reports, which may propose alternative recommendations, but no minority or concurring report shall be issued by any staff personnel without the consent of the manager.

(e)  Debate and Discussion. Debate and discussion in committees shall be informal, and the chair shall impose time limits on presentations and discussions as shall be appropriate.

2.05.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter shall vest the power in the electorate to recall officials elected by them so that the officials may be directly responsible for their behavior in office to the electorate.

The power of the electorate to recall should serve as an impetus to elected officials to be faithful to this trust. It is also intended to serve as an expeditious and effective means for removing from office an elected official who has failed to sustain such trust. While no specific charges are required to be lodged formally against an elected official to subject him to recall referendum, the individual reasons of each elector for signing a recall petition or voting accordingly shall be deemed sufficient cause for a recall.

(2)  The fire chief or his/her designee must approve of the intended expenditure unless he/she determines that (1) the item or product sought to be brought on village property through the board's intended expenditure of funds will pose a genuine safety risk, (2) the item or product sought to be brought on village property through the board's intended expenditure of funds will legitimately interfere with a genuine operational need of the village's fire department, or (3) the intended expenditure will not be made for the maintenance, use or benefit of the village's fire department. The fire chief and the village will not otherwise interfere with the expenditure of funds by the board or its officers, and, in all circumstances, will comply with the requirements of Sections 11-10-1 and 2 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-10-1 and 2). 
(3)  If the fire chief or his/her designee determines that (1) the item or product sought to be brought on village property through the board's intended expenditure of funds will pose a genuine safety risk, (2) the item or product sought to be brought on village property through the board's intended expenditure of funds will legitimately interfere with a genuine operational need of the village's fire department, or (3) the intended expenditure will not be made for the maintenance, use or benefit of the village's fire department, the fire chief or his/her designee shall notify the board's chairperson or treasurer in writing that he/she does not approve of the intended expenditure of funds and the foreign fire board shall not make the expenditure. That notification must be delivered to the board's chairperson or secretary prior to the announced date of the intended expenditure (when possible) and no later than five business days (excluding weekends and recognized village holidays) from the day on which the fire chief received written notice of the foreign fire board's intent to make an expenditure of funds. The fire chief's or his/her designee's failure to respond in writing shall be taken as an approval of the intended expenditure. The fire chief's or his/her designee's written notification of disapproval shall contain a statement of the reasons for his/her determination that the intended expenditure (1) will pose a genuine safety risk, (2) will legitimately interfere with a genuine operational need of the village's fire department, or (3) will not be made for the maintenance, use or benefit of the village's fire department. The fire chief's or his/her designee's written notification of disapproval will not be valid in cases where he/she has not asserted any reason to support his/her determination(s) with respect to the intended expenditure and the foreign fire board shall make the proposed expenditure. 
(4)  Within seven calendar days from, but not including, the day on which the fire chief or his/her designee tendered his/her written notice of disapproval, one or more of the foreign fire board's officers shall meet with the fire chief or his/her designee in person for the purpose of discussing the fire chief's or his/her designee's disapproval of the intended expenditure of funds. During that meeting, the parties shall, in good faith, make their best attempt to resolve the dispute. 
(5)  In the absence of reaching a resolution concerning the intended expenditure of funds during the parties' in-person meeting, either party may request that the dispute be appealed to the village manager. The notification must be in writing. Within seven calendar days from, but not including, the day on which the appeal is provided to the village manager, one or more of the foreign fire board's officers shall meet with the village manager in person for the purpose of discussing the fire chief's disapproval of the intended expenditure of funds. During that meeting, the parties shall, in good faith, make their best attempt to resolve the dispute. Within five business days (excluding weekends and recognized village holidays) of this meeting, the village manager shall issue a written decision on the matter. If the board is not satisfied with the manager's decision, it may pursue legal action in the circuit court of Cook County.

Fees for said bond shall be paid from the funds collected from the foreign fire insurance tax. 
(j)  As part of the village's annual audit, the fund shall be audited and said audit shall be provided to the village for its records. 
(k)  The foreign fire board shall be authorized to expend fund monies to pay for legal, financial or other professional services that are necessary for the board to execute its statutory duties and/or protect its statutory interests. 
(l)  Trustees and officers of the foreign fire board shall be released from duty without loss of pay to attend to board functions, meetings and responsibilities provided that attendance at such meetings does not result in additional expenses to the village, does not interfere with the daily operations of the fire department and does not adversely impact emergency operations. 
(m)  No trustee or officer of the foreign fire board shall be subject to any form of discipline on the basis of engaging in any legitimate activity on behalf of the foreign fire board.

However, in the event that any portion of the amount deposited is utilized during the period for which it is deposited in order to compensate the operator for nonpayment of rent or to make a good faith reimbursement to the operator for damage caused by the tenant, the principal on which the interest accrues may be recomputed to reflect the reduction for the period commencing on the first day of the calendar month following the reduction. 
    The park operator shall, within thirty days after the end of each twelve-month period, pay to the tenant any interest owed under this section in cash, provided, however, that the amount owed may be applied to rent due if the owner and tenant agree thereto.

Use-based charges are charges for services or facilities that are based on the amount of the resident's use of a particular service or facility. A charge is not use-based if a resident is charged even when he does not use the service or facility, or if different residents are assessed the same charge for using different levels of service or facilities. 
(b)  Charges for existing use-based services or facilities shall be set out in the rental agreement, and can only be increased as set out in the rental agreement. Any increase shall be reasonably related to the increases in the park operator's costs.

The total of payments under the formula for the park as a whole for a billing period may not exceed the sum billed by the public utility. The formula shall include all those that use that public utility service and may reflect variations in mobile home size or usage. The park operator shall also make available to the resident upon request a copy of the public utility bill for any billing period for which payment is demanded. Nothing herein shall preclude a park operator from leasing property to a resident, including the cost of utilities, for a rental which does not segregate or allocate the cost of the utilities. 
(b)  Any park operator who allocates public utility payments to residents by means of an individual meter, owned by the park operator, to the mobile home shall do so only in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  No park operator shall charge a resident a per-unit cost for such utility in excess of the per-unit charge of the utility service provider. 
(2)  No park operator shall include within the areas to be individually metered to a mobile home any common areas of the mobile home park. 
(3)  Utility charges allocated to residents shall be based upon the actual individual meter reading and, except as provided herein, no charge shall be based upon estimated meter readings.

Such request shall be in writing and delivered personally or by certified mail to the park operator.

In the event the meter is determined to be accurate the resident requesting the test shall be responsible for payment of the costs of removal, testing and reinstallation of the meter. 
(6)  Any individual meter determined to be inaccurate or inoperable shall be immediately replaced by the park operator at his sole cost and expense. 
(Ord. 3181 § B (part), 1996)

(1)  Snow removal, lawn care, or similar site maintenance services performed by the operator, upon the failure of a resident to fulfill the resident's site obligations under the rental agreement. No charges may be imposed for site maintenance services performed by the operator under this subsection unless the resident, if available, is given prior notice and a reasonable opportunity to perform the resident's obligation under the rental agreement. Charges for site maintenance services shall be set forth in the rental agreement, and shall be reasonable and limited to the park operator's actual costs;

(c)  No rule or regulation shall be enforceable against a resident unless a copy of all rules and regulations was delivered to the resident prior to signing the rental agreement.

If, upon reinspection, the department of community development finds that the licensed property in connection with which the notice was issued is now in compliance with this Chapter, then the code official may reinstate the license. The request for a reinspection shall not stay the revocation of the license unless the code official grants such request pursuant to a showing of good cause by the property owner.

The code official shall transmit to the village board copies of all records and notices upon which the suspension is based.

The property owner may, however, obtain a new license after all violations have been corrected and by following the procedures for obtaining a new license and payment of appropriate fee as set forth in this Chapter. 
(i)  If a license is revoked without having the opportunity of a suspension hearing, the property owner has the right to appeal that revocation. Said appeal shall conform to subsection (f) of this section. Such an appeal shall operate as a stay of the revocation until such time as the village board renders a decision on the appeal. 
(j)  Whenever a license is revoked, the code official shall send notice to the property owner or the listed property agent at the last address provided on the most recent license application.

(Ord. No. 4546, § 1, 9-7-2010) 
5.18.180 - Food service and food processing establishment grease trap/interceptor requirements. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish rules and regulations for the management of fats, oils and greases (FOG) discharged to the village sanitary sewers by food service and food processing establishments. 
(a)  Definitions. The definitions contained in this Chapter shall be observed and applied: 
(1)  "FOG" means fats, oils, greases, starches, proteins and certain other materials from animal or vegetable origins. FOG may originate from discharges from scullery sinks, pot and pan sinks, food processing equipment and floor drains located in a food processing area of a food manufacturer, retail food store or food service establishment. 
(2)  "Food processing establishment" means a commercial facility in which food is manufactured or packaged for human or domestic animal consumption. The term does not include a food service establishment or retail food store. 
(3)  "Grease trap/interceptor" shall mean a constructed device, whether installed internally or externally, and its surfaces and working parts, with the function of removing FOG from wastewaters before such waters are discharged to village sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  "Hauler" means a waste disposal business, that hauls and disposes of pumped materials and waste from a grease trap/interceptor. 
(5)  "High volume establishment" means a food establishment, retail food store or bakery that has deep fat fryers, woks, griddles and those establishments that bake, cook, prepare or wash grease-laden foods, grease-laden equipment or utensils. 
(6)  "Low volume establishment" means a food establishment or retail food store which does not have fryers or woks and those establishments that do not cook, prepare or wash large amounts of grease-laden foods or grease-laden equipment. 
(7)  "Manifest" means a log or document record of the hauler's name and address; and the volume, date of removal and disposal destination of pumped materials or waste from a grease trap/interceptor. (415 ILCS 22.30(d), (e)) 
(8)  "Village" means the village of Wheeling or its representatives from public works and community development departments as well as the public health and engineering divisions. 
(9)  "Twenty-five percent rule (25% rule)" means all grease traps/interceptors shall be cleaned based on the 25% rule. FOR EXAMPLE: If the total depth (TD) of a grease trap/interceptor is forty inches, the maximum allowable depth (d) of floatable and settled FOG equals forty inches multiplied by 0.25 or d = TD x 0.25 = 10 inches. Therefore, the maximum allowable depth of floatable and settled FOG in the grease trap/interceptor should not exceed ten inches. 
(b)  Required Installation and Use of Grease Trap/Interceptors. 
(1)  Each person or operating facility within the village, other than a private residence, which is or will be used for the manufacture, processing or preparation of food or food products must install and use, at its own expense, an appropriately sized grease trap/interceptor. 
(2)  External grease interceptors are required for high volume establishments. A permit is required through the community development department and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago. 
(3)  All new or altered restaurants that require an external grease trap/interceptor shall install a minimum of a one thousand gallon unit as per the village's engineering grease basin standard. 
(4)  Mechanical dishwashers will not be allowed to connect to any grease trap/ interceptor. 
(5)  Interior grease traps are required for low volume establishments. These restaurants do not have deep fat fryers, woks or griddles and limit their menu to nonfried foods, sandwiches, soups and other fresh foods. Grease traps are required for retail food stores that have meat cutting rooms, fish and deli areas. Interior grease traps must be cleaned and maintained on a weekly basis to prevent backups and odors. 
(c)  Required Cleaning, Maintenance and Inspection of Grease Trap/Interceptors. 
(1)  Operation of Plumbing Equipment, Section 890.200 of the Illinois State Plumbing Code states all plumbing equipment required by this Part shall be operated in the manner intended by the manufacturer and as required by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago operating permit. No alteration or modifications to plumbing fixtures, equipment and appurtenances which negate specified safety features shall be allowed. All plumbing systems shall be maintained in a functional, safe and sanitary condition. The owner of the facility shall be responsible for maintenance of the sanitary plumbing system. 
(2)  Each person who owns or operates a grease trap/interceptor shall have it maintained by having the accumulated FOG removed by a licensed hauler. The collected material shall be delivered to a facility authorized to use, treat or dispose of such material. 
(3)  High volume establishments shall have the grease trap/interceptor cleaned of accumulated FOG completed on a biannual basis unless the village determines that less or more frequent maintenance schedule is required to minimize the discharge of FOG into the village sanitary sewer system. 
(4)  Low volume establishments shall have the grease trap/interceptor cleaned of accumulated FOG completed on a biannual basis unless the village determines that less or more frequent maintenance schedule is required to minimize the discharge of FOG into the village sanitary sewer system. 
(5)  The structural integrity of the grease trap/interceptor shall be maintained. Any decaying structure, as determined by the village must either be replaced or be repaired. Repairs or replacement shall be the sole responsibility of the owner. 
(d)  Prohibition of Discharge of FOG. 
(1)  No person shall discharge a concentration of FOG into the village sanitary sewers from a facility required to install, use and maintain a grease trap/interceptor. 
(2)  No person shall reintroduce or deposit into the sanitary sewer system FOG which have been removed from the sewer system by grease traps/interceptors. 
(e)  Prohibitions on Introduction of Enzymes and Emulsifiers. 
(1)  No person shall introduce, nor allow the introduction of physical, chemical or biological agents into grease trap/interceptors for the purpose of suspending, dissolving, emulsifying or rendering soluble any FOG removed from wastewater by such grease trap/interceptors and reintroducing them into the village sanitary sewer system. 
(f)  Record Keeping Requirements for Grease Trap/Interceptors. 
(1)  The owner or operator of the grease trap/interceptor shall receive a manifest form from the licensed hauler after the grease trap/interceptor is cleaned. This manifest shall be retained for a minimum of two years by the owner or operator and the copies be stored on site. 
(2)  A copy of the most recent manifest must be sent to the village health division biannually on/or before July 31st and December 31st. 
(g)  Inspections. Any of the following three methods listed below may be used to determine if any grease trap/interceptor is functioning properly: 
(1)  The village may make, without notice to the owner of the facility, periodic inspections of the grease trap/interceptor to verify current operating conditions. The inspectors may use the 25% rule to check the condition of the grease trap/interceptor. 
(2)  Visual inspection of the grease trap/interceptor will be conducted to verify structural integrity and functionality. 
(3)  Inspections of manholes downstream of grease trap/interceptors will be conducted by village inspectors to check for accumulations of greases from upstream grease trap/interceptors. 
(h)  Failure to Maintain Grease Trap/Interceptors. 
(1)  If the operating condition of the grease trap/interceptor is found to be in noncompliance, the owner shall be required to take immediate action to correct such deficiencies with the grease trap/interceptor upon receipt of the inspection report/notice of violation. 
(2)  If the owner does not correct the deficiencies noted on the notice of violation, in the time frame established, the village may cause the grease trap/interceptor and private sewer lines to be properly cleaned and maintained, either through private parties hired by the village or by village staff. 
(3)  The owner of the grease trap/interceptor will be held liable for all costs incurred by the lack of maintenance, including labor, materials, administrative costs whether by outside contractors or by village staff. 
(4)  The business license or annual business-related license may be suspended, revoked, or not renewed if the owner fails to reimburse the village for incurred expenses. 
(5)  Administrative citations will be issued to those establishments that fail to maintain their grease trap/interceptors.

(b)  "Obscene" Defined. A thing is "obscene" if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest; that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of undeveloped photographs. 
(c)  Interpretation of Evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience. 
    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance. 
    In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
(1)  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
(2)  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
(3)  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or the absence thereof; 
(4)  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
(5)  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; 
(6)  Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. 
(d)  Prima Facie Evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of obscene material, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(e)  Affirmative Defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under eighteen years of age; 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material. 
(Ord. 2301 § E (part), 1986) 
8.10.020 - Dissemination of harmful material. 
(a)  Elements of the Offense.

(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Material is "harmful" if, to the average person, applying contemporary standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is to prurient interest, that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excrement, which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters, and is material the redeeming social importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal. 
(2)  "Material," as used in this section, means any writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment. 
(3)  "Distribute" means to transfer possession of, whether with or without consideration. 
(4)  "Knowingly," as used in this section, means having knowledge of the contents of the subject matter, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the contents thereof. 
(c)  Interpretation of Evidence. 
(1)  The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same general age of the child to whom such material was offered, distributed, sent or exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of the material shall be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group. 
(2)  In prosecutions under this section, where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity indicates the material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can justify the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is in fact substantially less than its prurient appeal. 
(d)  Affirmative Defenses. 
(1)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit any public library or any library operated by an accredited institution of higher education from circulating harmful material to any person under eighteen years of age, provided such circulation is in aid of a legitimate scientific or educational purpose, and it shall be an affirmative defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the act charged was committed in aid of legitimate scientific or educational purposes.

(3)  Proof that the defendant demanded, was shown and acted in reliance upon any of the following documents as proof of the age of a child, shall be a defense to any criminal prosecution under this section: A document issued by the Federal government or any state, county or municipal government or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces. 
(4)  In the event an advertisement of harmful material as defined in this section culminates in the sale or distribution of such harmful material to a child, under circumstances where there was no personal confrontation of the child by the defendant, his employees or agents, as where the order or request for such harmful material was transmitted by mail, telephone or similar means of communication, and delivery of such harmful material to the child was by mail, freight or similar means of transport, it shall be a defense in any prosecution for a violation of this section that the advertisement contained the following statement, or a statement substantially similar thereto, and that the defendant required the purchaser to certify that he was not under eighteen years of age and that the purchaser falsely stated that he was not under eighteen years of age: 
NOTICE It is unlawful for any person under 18 years of age to purchase the material herein advertised. Any person under 18 years of age who falsely states that he is not under 18 years of age for the purpose of obtaining the material advertised herein, is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor under the laws of the State of Illinois.

It is unlawful for any person under eighteen years of age to falsely state, either orally or in writing, that he is not under the age of eighteen years, or to present or offer to any person any evidence of age and identity which is false or not actually his own for the purpose of ordering, obtaining, viewing or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure or view any harmful material.

2.  Size and weight limitations while operating on Village streets shall not apply to fire apparatus or equipment for snow or ice removal operations owned or operated by or for any governmental body or to implements of husbandry temporarily operated or towed in a combination in the furtherance of a farm or agricultural endeavor and to any vehicle or combination of vehicles operating under the terms of a valid oversize and/or dimension permit issued by the State of Illinois or Counties of Lake and Cook. 
3.  Where lower size and weight limits or other restrictions are imposed by ordinance under authority of 625 ILCS 5/15-111, 15-316 and 15-317, and signs indicating such limitations or restrictions are posted, it shall be unlawful to operate any vehicle or combination of vehicles in excess of such size or weight limitations or in violation of such restrictions. 
4.  Whenever any vehicle or combination of vehicles is operated in violation of this section, the owner and/or driver of such vehicle shall be deemed guilty of such violation and either or both the owner and driver of such vehicle may be prosecuted for such violation in an administrative adjudication hearing, as provided for in the Village Code, or otherwise. 
C.  Permits for Overweight and/or Overdimension Vehicles.

3.  Permits for vehicles both overweight and/or oversize are valid only a half hour before sunrise until a half hour after sunset, on any day which a permit issued by the Illinois Department of Transportation is valid. 
4.  Permits are nontransferrable and apply only to the permittee and vehicle to which it was issued. 
5.  The Village, in its discretion, may issue revisions to permits for a fee of twenty dollars (or fifty percent of the original permit fee if the original permit fee was thirty dollars or less):

(b)  To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered before the move; 
(c)  To adjust weights, dimension or routes as issued on the permit, before the move is made. 
6.  The permit, when issued constitutes an agreement between the permittee and the Village that the move described in the application will take place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the Police Department any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the Village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. 
7.  The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of roads within the jurisdiction of the Village, and any vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the driver's possession in either written or electronic form at all times unless otherwise directed by the Police Department and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of inspection. 
8.  Any vehicle(s) and/or load found to be divisible will render the permit null and void. The entire gross weight and axles weights of the vehicle(s) with the load are subject to legal size and weights. It is the duty of the applicant to verify the nondivisibility of the vehicle(s) before making application for the permit. The permit application itself is prima facie evidence that the applicant confirmed the vehicle(s) and/or load were non-divisible. 
9.  If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, property moved, bridge or highway analysis performed and completed in advance of any permit movement.

(b)  A permittee, its agents, or employees operating on a permit which has been altered for purposes of deception;

Quarterly and annual permits shall list the registration number and state (if applicable) for the power unit, and vehicle identification number (VIN). The serial number of the power unit, and/or owner applied number shall also be listed, if applicable. 
    Any violation of these terms will render the certificate null and void, and subject the driver, firm, business, or corporation that owns the vehicle to legal weight and dimension laws. The arresting police officer will immediately confiscate the permit. 
14.  All applications for permits shall be given full consideration. Permits for proposed moves may be issued: 
(a)  When the Village roadways and bridges will not be unduly damaged; and

21.  The Chief of Police or their designee shall administer and enforce this section and shall have the authority to grant, deny, suspend, or reinstate Permits. Any applicant or permittee denied a permit or who has had a permit suspended, upon request, shall be given a hearing before the Chief of Police first, then the Village Manager if the permittee is still unsatisfied. 
22.  No permits shall be issued to an applicant or company who has outstanding fees or payments due to the Village. 
23.  The Village with respect to highways under its jurisdiction shall collect a fee as shown herein from applicants for the issuance of a permit to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicle(s), and/or loads, which fit the categories shown.

(a)  A motor vehicle parked upon a public street, public parking lot or private parking lot regulated pursuant to contract at any time may, by or under the direction of an officer or member of the Wheeling police department be immobilized in such a manner as to prevent its operation, if there is outstanding one or more judgments issued in favor of the village of Wheeling against the owner of such motor vehicle. 
(b)  Upon immobilization of such motor vehicle, the officer or employee shall cause to be placed on such vehicle in a conspicuous manner, notice sufficient to warn any individual that such vehicle has been immobilized and that any attempt to move such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle. As soon as practicable, the officer or employee shall inform the owner of the immobilized vehicle of the nature and circumstances of the prior outstanding traffic violation judgment for which such vehicle was immobilized.

The post-immobilization hearing shall not be determinative of or adjudicate any judgment issued relative to any immobilized vehicle.

(f)  The owner of an immobilized vehicle shall pay a fee as provided in the schedule of fees and charges set forth in Chapter 1.26 of this code, for such immobilization. The owner of an immobilized vehicle which was subsequently impounded shall pay a fee as provided in the schedule of fees and charges set forth in Chapter 1.26 of this code, for immobilization, plus the towing and storage charges actually incurred in such case. 
(g)  It is unlawful for any unauthorized person or persons to attempt to remove or to remove the vehicle immobilizing device. 
(h)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive any person of the constitutional right to a hearing or trial as to the violations charged or to an appeal from the judgment entered. 
(Ord. 4131 § N, 2006; Ord. 2999 § A, 1994) 
9.20.105 - Reporting excessive stopping, standing and parking violations. 
(a)  The village shall send a certified report to the Illinois Secretary of State against the registered owner of any vehicle that has accumulated ten or more unsatisfied "stopping, standing and parking" violations in this Chapter. A violation under this Chapter shall be considered unsatisfied if the village has previously and properly cited a penalty to the registered owner, (see Section 9.18.123 of this Chapter, "Prima facie evidence"), according to the applicable provisions of the village code and said penalty has remained unpaid or remains outstanding for more than thirty days. 
(b)  The certified report to the secretary of state shall contain the following information:

(4)  The date on which the notice was sent; and

The notice sent by the village to the vehicle's registered owner shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the vehicle's registered owner as recorded with the Illinois Secretary of State and shall set forth the following: 
(1)  A statement that the vehicle has ten or more unsatisfied parking or standing violations as set forth in this Chapter; 
(2)  A statement that failure to pay any fine or penalty within forty-five days of the notice shall result in the village sending certification to the Illinois Secretary of State as described in subsection (a) of this section; 
(3)  A statement that failure to pay any fine or penalty within forty-five days of the notice may result in a suspension of the registered owner's Illinois driver's license by the Illinois Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, (625 ILCS 5/6-306.5); and 
(4)  A statement that the registered owner may challenge the accuracy of the certified report by requesting in writing, within ten days of receipt of notice, a hearing with the village manager or his designee. The only bases for such a challenge are: 
(i)  The person not having been the owner or lessee of the vehicle or vehicles receiving ten or more standing, parking or compliance violation notices on the date or date such notices were issued; and

C.  Seizure and Impoundment. 
1.  Whenever a police officer has reason to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility approved by the chief of police. This section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was stolen at that time and verified proof of the theft is provided to the Village. 
2.  The police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner or lessee of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle owner or lessee's right to request an administrative hearing to be conducted under this section. 
D.  Administrative Hearing. Within ten business days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify the owner of record or lessee and any lien holder by first class U.S. mail or personal service to the addresses registered with the Secretary of State, of the owner's, lessee's, and any lien holder's right to request a hearing to challenge whether a violation of this section has occurred. The owner of record, lessee or any lien holder seeking a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the chief of police or his designee no later than ten business days after notice was mailed. If a request for a hearing is filed, the city shall notify by first class mail or personal service, the owner of record or lessee and any lien holder of the date, time and location of the administrative hearing. The hearing date must be no more than fifteen business days after a request for a hearing has been filed. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of this section, then the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record or lessee of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for the administrative penalty of five hundred dollars. If, after a hearing, the hearing officer does not determine by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such a violation, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding for the owner or lessee and for the return of the vehicle. If the owner of record or lessee requests a hearing but fails to appear at the hearing or fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record or lessee shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village in the amount of the administrative penalty. However, if the owner of record or lessee pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the owner or lessee, no default order need be entered if the owner or lessee is informed of his or her right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which case an order of liability shall be deemed to have been made when the village receives the written waiver. All orders entered by the hearing officer shall be in writing. 
E.  Disposition of Impounded Vehicle. A penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall constitute a debt due and owing the village. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this section shall remain impounded until: 
1.  The penalty of five hundred dollars is paid to the village and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case the person who paid the penalty shall be given possession of the vehicle, 
2.  A bond in the amount of five hundred dollars is posted with the police department and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing agent, at which time the vehicle will be released to the person who posted the bond, or 
3.  The vehicle is deemed abandoned or unclaimed as provided in subsection G below, in which case the vehicle shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of abandoned vehicles. 
F.  Posting of Bond. If a bond in the amount of five hundred dollars is posted with the police department, the impounded vehicle shall be released to the owner or lessee of record or any lien holder; the owner or lessee of the vehicle shall still be liable to the towing agent for any applicable towing fees. If a five hundred dollar penalty is imposed for violation of this section, the five hundred dollar bond will be forfeited to the village; however if a violation of this section is not proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the five hundred dollar bond will be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond money posted pursuant to this section shall be held by the village until the hearing officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until the court issues its decision. 
G.  Vehicle Possession. Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within thirty-five days after the expiration of the time during which the owner of record or lessee may seek judicial review of the village's action under this section, or the time at which a final judgment is rendered in favor of the village, or the time a final administrative decision is rendered against an owner of record or lessee who is in default, may be disposed of as an unclaimed vehicle as provided by law, provided, however, that where proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may not be disposed of by the village except as consistent with those proceedings. 
H.  Any owner of record, lessee, lien holder or other person with a legal interest in the motor vehicle, shall have the right to appeal the decision of the hearing officer to the Circuit Court for the First Judicial Circuit, Cook County, Illinois, pursuant to the Administrative Review Act, 735 ILCS 5/3-101, et seq., as amended. Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this chapter which remains unpaid in whole or in part after the expiration of the deadline for seeking judicial review under the Administrative Review Act may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. 4294 § 1, 2007: Ord. 4276 § 2, 2007) 
(Ord. No. 4707, § 2, 7-16-2012) 
9.40.020 - Tow rotation list. 
A.  Pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/4-203.5, the chief of police shall be authorized to establish a tow rotation list in the village. The chief of police shall create an application to be placed on the tow rotation list and include the requirements for all potential towing vendors which contain, at minimum, the requirements of 625 ILCS 5/4-203.5. The chief of police shall evaluate the applications on an annual basis and determine whether the applicants are qualified and whether any changes should be made to the tow rotation list. The chief of police may choose to have only one towing service on its tow rotation list. Complaints regarding the process for inclusion on a tow rotation list or the use of a tow rotation list may be referred in writing to the chief of police. The chief of police shall make the final determination as to which qualified towing services shall be included on a tow rotation list, 
B.  Use of Tow Rotation List. Whenever a Wheeling police officer initiates a tow of a vehicle, the officer shall contact the Wheeling Police Dispatch and indicate that a tow has been authorized. If more than one towing service is on the tow rotation list, the police department shall then select a towing service from tow rotation list corresponding to the geographical area where the tow was authorized, and shall contact that towing service directly by phone, computer, or similar means. Towing services shall be contacted in the order listed on the appropriate tow rotation list, at which point the towing service shall be placed at the end of that tow rotation list. In the event a listed towing service is not available, the next listed towing service on that tow rotation list shall be contacted. 
C.  Deviations. 
1.  The Wheeling Police Department may decide to deviate from the list if the next towing service is incapable or not properly qualified to handle a specific task or does not have the specific equipment or in the event of an emergency. A deviation from the tow rotation order for this reason shall not cause a loss of rotation turn by the towing service determined to be incapable or not properly equipped for handling the request. 
2.  In the event of an emergency, the Wheeling Police Department, taking into account the safety and location of the situation, may deviate from the order of the tow rotation list and obtain towing service from any source deemed appropriate. 
D.  In addition, if the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle is not under arrest and does not abandon his vehicle, and the vehicle is not impeding or obstructing traffic, illegally parked or poses a security or safety risk, as determined by the officer, the officer shall allow the owner to select a towing service. If the owner chooses not to specify a towing service, the law enforcement agency shall select a towing service for the vehicle as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
E.  If a tow operator is present or arrives where a tow is needed and has not been requested by the agency, it shall be instructed to leave by law enforcement.

(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the village's jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the village rights-of-way and the village as a whole. 
(b)  Intent. In enacting this Chapter, the village intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the village and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation: 
(1)  Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places; 
(2)  Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
(3)  Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property; 
(4)  Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities; 
(5)  Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces; 
(6)  Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed; 
(7)  Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the village's residential neighborhoods; 
(8)  Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and 
(9)  Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations. 
(c)  Facilities Subject to This Chapter. This Chapter applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement. 
(d)  Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. The village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the village rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the village enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the village may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this Chapter. 
(e)  Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements. 
(1)  Utilities Other than Telecommunications Providers. In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the village, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(2)  Telecommunications Providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this Chapter and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the village and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(f)  Conflicts with Other Chapters. This Chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict. 
(g)  Conflicts with State and Federal Laws. In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this Chapter, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this Chapter to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations. 
(h)  Sound Engineering Judgment. The village shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this Chapter and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this Chapter when the village so determines. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the village to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

(e)  Replenishment. Within fourteen days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and Return of Security Fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights Not Limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this Chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

Utilizing the street tree plan for the village, the planner will determine the number of trees required to fill the street tree void. On issuance of the building permit, applicant shall pay the per tree planting cost as determined by the director. 
(2)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit as described in this section, the applicant shall complete a tree survey and prepare a tree preservation plan for review by the director or planner. The tree preservation plan shall describe the area in which existing trees eight inches in diameter as measured four feet above grade shall be protected and, to the extent possible, preserved. The area of protection shall be calculated by dividing the diameter of the tree trunk (in inches at four feet above grade) by two to determine the radius around the tree (in feet) to be protected. (Example: A tree with a diameter of twenty-four inches at four feet above grade would require a radius of protection of twelve feet.) 
    The area of protection shall be physically marked with a fence of at least three feet in height. 
    No tunneling or boring shall be made within four feet, six inches of the ground surface within the area of protection. 
    The building activity area shall be the smallest possible area in which grading and construction activities will take place.

(a)  The sewer service charge for the use and for service supplied by the sewer system of the village shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, and a local capital cost charge comprised of a debt service charge and a capital improvement charge. 
(1)  The debt service charge shall be computed by apportioning the annual debt service on a cost per one thousand gallon basis. 
(2)  The capital improvement charge shall be levied on all users to provide for capital improvements, extensions or reconstruction of the sewer system. The capital improvement charge is computed by apportioning the annual amount to be accrued as a cost per one thousand gallons. 
(3)  Except as otherwise provided herein the basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters. It shall consist of operations and maintenance costs and shall be computed as follows: 
(A)  Estimate wastewater volume to be transported; 
(B)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the sewer system facilities including a replacement fund for the year; 
(C)  Proportion the estimated operation, maintenance and replacement costs to each user by volume;

(3)  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, at his expense, by the person discharging such waste. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the village. 
(c)  Local Capital Cost Charge. 
(1)  A debt service charge of zero cents per one thousand gallons, to each user of the sewer system of the village is established. 
(2)  A capital improvement charge will be levied on all users as a charge of zero cents per one thousand gallons, to provide funds for extension, improvement and reconstruction of the sewer system.

    A minimum charge, as follows: 
    For water billed during January 2019, and thereafter, four dollars and sixty-two cents per bi-monthly billing period shall be applied to all users whose water consumption does not exceed three thousand gallons per bi-monthly billing period. All non-metered residential users of the waste water system shall pay a minimum flat rate of twenty-four dollars and sixty-four cents. The flat rate will allow a maximum of sixteen thousand gallons per bi-monthly billing period. 
    In the event use of the sewer system is determined by the village to be in excess of sixteen thousand gallons per bi-monthly billing period, the village may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply or sewer system service line to measure the amount of service supplied. 
(e)  The wastewater service charge shall be computed by the following formula: 
CW = CC + CD + CM + (VU - X) CU Where: CW = Amount of waste service charge per quarter CD = Debt service charge CC = Capital improvement charge CM = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance, and repair VU = Wastewater volume for billing period X = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge CU = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and repair  
(f)  All books, documents, papers and records of the village which are applicable to this system of user charges shall be available to state and federal agencies for the purpose of making audit, examinations, excerpts, and transcriptions thereof. 
(g)  The method of computation of rates and service charges established shall be made available to a user within fourteen days of receipt of a written request for such. Any disagreement over the method used or in the computation thereof shall be remedied by the village within thirty days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining the discrepancies.

Chapter 17.26 - IMPACT FEES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Section A of Ord. No 4526, passed May 17, 2010, amended Ch. 17.26 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 17.26 was titled Park, School and Library Donations, was comprised of §§ 17.26.010-17.26.130, and derived from Ord. No. 3569. 

17.26.010 - Impact fees required. 
    As a condition of approval of an annexation, a final plat of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each owner, subdivider or developer is required to provide a cash contribution in accordance with the criteria and formula set forth herein to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development for the following purposes: park and recreational sites and/or improvements, school sites and/or improvements, and library services and/or improvements. In lieu of a cash contribution, the owner, subdivider, or developer may make an actual land dedication, or a combination cash and land, subject to the final determination of the village board, as described in this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.020 - General purpose 
    The expected delay in reassessing the property taxes to correspond with the development that occurs on a given property is one year. Therefore, the intent of the fees described in this chapter is to provide funding to each entity to offset the cost of providing services to the residents in the development for one year. The fees for each entity are therefore directly related to the projected population of the development, based on the number, size, and type of the housing units to be constructed. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.030 - Donation process 
    Whenever an owner, subdivider, or developer seeks to annex land into the village, seeks approval of a final plat of subdivision, or seeks approval of a planned unit development: 
(a)  The owner, subdivider, or developer shall make a written request to the village's community development department for an invoice of the amount of fees owed pursuant to Chapter 17.26. 
(b)  The village shall timely respond to the owner's, subdivider's or developer's request pursuant to Section 17.26.030(a), using the formulas described in Chapter 17.26, with an invoice setting forth the amount of the required impact fee. 
(c)  The owner, subdivider or developer shall timely pay in full the required cash contribution to the village's community development department. In no case shall full payment be made more than thirty days after the developer receives each invoice set forth in Section 17.26.030(b). 
(d)  The village shall not approve any annexation, final plat of subdivision, planned unit development, or building permit related thereto, prior to receipt of full and final payment of the invoice set forth in Section 17.26.030(c). 
(e)  In the event that an owner, subdivider or developer proceeds with an annexation or planned unit development project with multiple buildings, and a request for a building permit is made to the village, the owner, subdivider or developer shall be responsible for payment of a proportionate share of the total fee under the terms of Section 17.26.030 prior to the issuance of a building permit by the village. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.040 - Impact fee amounts and formulas. 
(a)  Fee Amounts. The following are the fees due to each governmental entity based on the number, size, and type of the units to be constructed:

Note: Library fees not based on land value 
MF - multi-family; ASF - attached single-family; DSF - detached single-family 
(b)  Formulas. The formulas by which the above-listed fees are calculated are described in the following sections: library district fees, Section 17.26.050; school district fees, Section 17.26.060; and park district fees, Section 17.26.070. 
(c)  Population Projections. The table used in calculating the projected population by age for each housing type is the most current table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, children per dwelling unit as published by the Illinois School Consulting Service/Associated Municipal Consultants, Inc., Naperville, Illinois. This table of population density is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the owner, subdivider or developer. The following table is a summary table based on the above listed source: 
Projected Population by Dwelling Unit Size/Type

(d)  Objections to Population Projections. In the event an owner, subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate population listed in this section, the owner, subdivider or developer shall submit his or her own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development; and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board at its sole discretion. 
(e)  Fair Market Value of Land. Several formulas described in this Chapter use the fair market value of land as a factor in determining required impact fees. The fair market value of an acre of land is interpreted to mean land that is improved as described in this chapter that would be suitable to be dedicated as a park/recreation and school sites. The fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is one hundred five thousand dollars per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein. The village board may, at its sole discretion, adopt a revised fair market value. 
(f)  Minimum Threshold for Requiring Fee. The impact fees described within this Chapter shall be applied to any new construction, building modification, subdivision, or planned unit development that causes a net increase of two bedrooms on the subject property. 
(g)  Maximum Fee Per Unit Per Entity. The maximum impact fee due to any single taxing body shall be two thousand dollars per unit. Any per-unit fee that exceeds this amount as the base formulas are periodically updated may be reduced accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.050 - Library district fee. 
(a)  Requirement. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear a direct relationship upon the cash contribution required. 
(b)  Formula. The library district fee shall be determined by multiplying the total number of dwelling units in the proposed development by the product of the population per dwelling unit multiplied by the per capita cost of providing library services as determined by the library district. 
(c)  Per Capita Cost of Services. The current cost of services is two hundred forty-eight dollars per person. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.060 - School district fees. 
(a)  Requirement. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the required impact fee. 
(b)  Formula. The school district fees shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of the estimated children to be served in each such school classification (see Section 17.26.040(c), Population Projections) over the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein (see Table 17.26.060(c) below), and then applying such ratio to the minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein (see Table 17.26.060(c) below). The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each school classification. That acreage shall then be multiplied by the current fair market value of land as described in this Chapter (Section 17.26.040(e), Fair Market Value of Land). 
(c)  School Classifications and Size of School Site. School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following table: 
School Site Size and 
Maximum Number of 
Students by School Type 
School Classification by Grades Maximum Number of Students for Each Such School Classification Minimum Number of Acres Land for Each School Site of Such Classification Elementary Schools, Grades Kindergarten thru 5th (K-5) 600 students 11 acres Junior High Schools, Grades 6th thru 8th (6-8) 900 students 19 acres High Schools, Grades 9th thru 12th (9-12) 2,300 students 40 acres  
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.070 - Park district fee. 
(a)  Requirement. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the required impact fee. 
(b)  Formula. The fee shall be based on a requirement of 7.45 acres of active recreation as described in Table 17.26.070(c), per one thousand of ultimate population (see Section 17.26.040(c), Population Projections). That acreage shall then be multiplied by the current fair market value of land as described in this Chapter (Section 17.26.040(e), Fair Market Value of Land). 
(c)  Recreation Areas by Size and Population Served. The minimum acreage of each park classification shall be determined in accordance with the following table: 
Recreation Areas by 
Size and Population Served 
Type of Recreation Area Size Range Minimum Acres Per 1,000 People Mini Park 2,500 sq. ft. - 1 acre Not applicable Neighborhood Park 1 acre - 10 acres 1.5 Community Park 10 acres - 50 acres 2.5 Regional Park 200- 999 acres Not applicable Greenways/Linear Parks N/A 0.25 Special Use Areas N/A 3.2 Conservation/

(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.080 - Land dedications in lieu of impact fees. 
(a)  Procedure for Requesting a Land Dedication in Lieu of Impact Fees. In order for an owner, subdivider or developer to contribute land in lieu of required impact fees, the entity receiving the land donation must provide written authorization to the village prior to final plat or final planned unit development approval. Any such written authorization provided to the village shall be signed and notarized and include a detailed description of the land to be dedicated (location, dimensions, intended use, etc.) as well as language clearly approving the dedication as well as the portion of the required impact fee that is to be replaced by the land dedication. 
    Upon receipt of the request by the developer and authorization of the entity to receive a land contribution, the village board shall then consider the request and may, at their sole discretion, approve a resolution authorizing a land dedication in lieu of all, or some portion, of the required impact fees. 
(b)  Philosophy of Acceptance. The land or site for school, park, and recreation land dedication must be suitable for the purpose for which it is intended. Land set aside by developers for schools, parks, recreation and conservation purposes shall not include what has been left over after residential, commercial, industrial and other development has been taken for prime land. The following requirements shall apply: 
(1)  Topography and Grading. The slope, topography, geology, grading and ground cover of the dedicated site must be suitable for its intended purposes and conform to design standards established by the village engineer. Grading on sites shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. 
(2)  Improved Sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provision made therefore. The sidewalk and parkway improvements will be installed before final acceptance of public improvements. 
(3)  Land Conveyance by Warranty Deed. The following requirements shall be provided prior to acceptance of any land to be dedicated or donated: 
a.  A current survey; 
b.  A title insurance commitment, acceptable to the village, in an amount no less than the fair market value of the land as determined by the village; 
c.  A warranty deed; 
d.  A written statement from the grantor or developer stating that they shall be responsible for paying the real estate taxes on the land until an exemption is obtained; 
e.  A phase I environmental study indicating that the land is free from environmental contamination. 
(c)  Required Land for School Sites. 
(1)  Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. Variances in land uses could, however, change the locations and/or number of sites. All elementary, junior high and senior high schools shall be located to serve the greatest number of children possible within walking distance. Access shall be available on fully improved streets. Adjacent land use to the school site must be considered. School sites shall not serve as buffers between residential-commercial and residential-industrial use. 
(2)  The amount of land to be dedicated shall be as described in Table 17.26.060(c). The school district may, at its discretion, authorize an alternative amount of land dedication, provided that the dedication meets the requirements of this section. 
(3)  Whenever planning is done jointly with the park district for a school-park site, the school-owned portion shall comply with the specifications contained herein. 
(d)  Required Land for Park, Recreation, and Conservation Sites. 
(1)  Active areas shall be defined as those areas specifically adapted and planned for a wide range of physical activity such as group games, physical education, sports, and athletics. Facilities usually include, but are not limited to, playfields, game courts, rinks, ball diamonds, pools, tennis courts, community centers, and play apparatus. Passive areas shall be defined as settings designed for informal unscheduled activity based on individual, family, or group interests such as picnicking, nature lore, horticultural displays, hiking and biking, historical programs, and camping. Facilities may include, but not be limited to, landscape displays, rest pavilions, preschool tot lots, vest pocket parks for senior citizens, woodland trails, outdoor education centers, botanical gardens, hobby areas for model planes, and kite flying. 
(2)  Location. The comprehensive park and recreation plan and/or the "Standards by Types of Recreation and Park Areas," as adopted by the Wheeling or Prospect Heights park district, shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable and whenever feasible, the site shall be in close proximity to elementary school sites. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
(3)  Credit for Private Open Spaces and Recreation Areas. 
a.  When an owner, subdivider or developer provides their open space for recreation areas and facilities in their development, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the village board, be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the village board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. 
b.  In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village board, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the owner, subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total parkland dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(4)  The amount of land to be dedicated shall be as described in Table 17.26.070(c). The school district may, at its discretion, authorize an alternative amount of land dedication, provided that the dedication meets the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.090 - Reservation of additional land. 
    Where the comprehensive plan for the standards of the village calls for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit development that the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public entity designated by the village; provided, that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.100 - Annexation. 
    The policy of cash contributions or land dedications in lieu thereof as set forth in this chapter shall also apply to annexations of any land to the village and provisions therefore shall be governing all lands within the village and shall be incorporated in any preannexation agreement governing such land. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010) 
17.26.110 - Indemnification. 
    Prior to distribution of any funds by the village under Chapter 17.26, the affected park districts, library districts and school districts shall be required, as a condition of receiving the donations provided for in Chapter 17.26, to give to the village a written hold harmless and indemnification agreement, to the village's satisfaction. The hold harmless and indemnification agreement shall indemnify the village from any loss, claims, costs (including reasonable attorney fees), and causes of actions of every kind incurred by the village as a result, either directly or indirectly, of the enactment of this chapter, or the administration or enforcement thereof, including any loss, claims and causes of actions of every kind so incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought or threatened by any subdivider or developer including, but not limited to, claims or threatened claims related to the distribution or expenditure of such funds by the park districts, library districts and school districts. If the village is sued by any subdivider or developer as a result, directly or indirectly, of the enactment or operation of this chapter, the affected park district, library district or school district may, at its option, undertake the defense thereof, but all costs and expenses of such defense, including attorney fees, shall then be borne by the affected park district, library district or school district. 
(Ord. No. 4526, § A, 5-17-2010)

17.33.020 - Additional regulations. 
    When detention is provided, the following regulations shall apply in addition to the regulations of the village and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago: 
(a)  Bypass Channel. A natural or surface channel system shall be designated with adequate capacity to convey through the development of the stormwater runoff from all tributary upstream areas. Further, it shall meet the requirements of Section 3.09 of the Manual of Practice for the Design of Public and Private Improvements which are made a part of this Chapter. Stormwater management shall be required for all projects. 
(1)  These bypass channels shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a one-hundred-year storm, assuming all storm sewers are blocked and that the upstream areas are fully developed and have been saturated with antecedent rainfall. No habitable structures shall be constructed within this overland flow route; however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements may be considered compatible users. 
(2)  The design of this overland flow route system shall also take into consideration control of stormwater velocity to prevent erosion or other damage to a facility which will restrict its primary use. Depths of flow shall be kept to a minimum and the channel configurations shall be approved by the village engineer. 
(3)  If the development should contain an existing natural waterway or flow way, this area shall be preserved as part of the bypass drainage system. Construction of a low flow system of storm sewers to carry the minor storm runoff with a bottom of sufficient width which is adequate to facilitate maintenance and carry the runoff without eroding velocities shall be included in the plans for development. 
(b)  Dry Basins. All pervious dry bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent inundation. 
(1)  A method of carrying the low flow through these areas shall be provided in addition to a system of drains, and both shall be provided with a positive gravity outlet to a natural channel or storm sewer having adequate capacity. 
(2)  Flow through designs for detention basins are discouraged and generally not permitted. 
(3)  The combination of storage of the water from a one-hundred-year storm and the designed release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of seventy-two hours. Maximum depth of planned stormwater storage facility shall not exceed four feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to greater storage depth, and such as approved by the village engineer. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be two percent and maximum slopes shall be ten percent (ten units horizontally to one unit vertically). Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as practical and a ten percent slope or less shall be used wherever possible. If slopes greater than ten percent are necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions, the approval shall be obtained from the village engineer and suitable erosion control provided, in addition to the protection required to insure public health, safety and welfare. In no case will side slopes greater than 3:1 be permitted. 
(4)  Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall require little or no attention for proper operation. Each stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the one-hundred-year frequency storm occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without attention and shall become part of the natural or surface channel system described in subsection (a) of this section. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features. 
(5)  Both outlet control structures and emergency overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully protect the public health, safety and welfare. Stormwater runoff velocities shall be kept as a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outfall control structure will not be permitted without complete protection for the public safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and used only when no other method is feasible. 
(c)  Wet Basins. Wet bottom stormwater storage areas shall be designed with all of the items required for dry bottom stormwater storage areas except that a low flow conduit and a system of drains with a positive gravity outlet may be eliminated. Each such area shall comply with the following conditions: 
(1)  Water surface area shall not exceed one-tenth of the tributary drainage area unless approved otherwise; 
(2)  Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action; 
(3)  Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet. If fish are to be used to keep the pond clean, a minimum of one-fourth of the pond area shall be a minimum of ten feet deep; 
(4)  Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance; 
(5)  Control structures for stormwater release shall be designed to operate at full capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to substantiate all design features; 
(6)  In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for purposes of storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the evapo-transpiration demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of excess stormwater runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the one-hundred-year storm runoff; 
(7)  Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided. Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities shall be submitted with the engineering plans. 
(d)  Roof and Parking Lot Storage. Paved surfaces that are to serve as stormwater storage areas shall have minimum grades of one percent. Rooftop storage will not be allowed. If a portion of an area within a stormwater storage area is to be paved for parking or recreational purposes, the paved surface shall be placed near the highest elevation within the storage area as possible. Parking lot grades shall not exceed normal design parameters. 
(e)  Flood Damage Prevention. The facilities for stormwater runoff control shall be constructed prior to any earth moving or drainage related construction on the project site. 
(f)  Erosion Control. During the construction phases, means, methods, and facilities shall be provided to prevent the erosion of the earth. Silting of downstream areas are to be prevented through the strategic use of silting basins, sodding of runoff channels or other such methods in accordance with the soil erosion and sedimentation plan for the project as well as limiting the period of time during which the earth is stripped of vegetation.

Chapter 19.05 - MIXED USE AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

19.05.010 - Mixed use districts general requirements. 
(a)  Intent. The MX mixed use districts are intended to facilitate the development and redevelopment of areas suited to a combination of commercial and residential uses. It is recognized that some mature parts of the village are comprised of a variety of compatible uses and the mixed use districts are created for the purpose of maintaining the vitality of such areas and encouraging appropriate redevelopment as necessary. It is also noted that the village's comprehensive plan identifies several areas as appropriate for new mixed use development in the future, and these districts are also created to meet that need. 
(b)  Site Plan Review Required. In the MX mixed use districts, site plan review by the plan commission and approval by the board of trustees is required for all new development projects including single-family and two-family homes and any renovations involving alteration in building size, changes to the exterior of any building, or changes to site elements approved during a prior site plan review. All site plan submittals and reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Chapter 19.12 of this Title. 
(c)  Description of Mixed Use Zoning Districts. Projects proposed in each of the mixed use districts will be reviewed and evaluated according to the objectives of the comprehensive plan and the station area plan. The intent of each of the three mixed use districts will guide future development in these areas. 
(1)  MXT - Transit Oriented Mixed Use District. The MXT is the highest density district of the four mixed use districts. The Comprehensive Plan and Station Area Plan envision a town center surrounding the commuter rail station with a mix of retail, service, and residential uses. 
(2)  MXC - Commercial-Residential Mixed Use Area. The MXC is intended to be less dense than the MXT district. The comprehensive plan envisions a mix of residential and retail uses, either within the same building or in close proximity to each other. 
(3)  MXO - Open Space-Residential Mixed Use District. The MXO is the lowest density district of the four mixed use districts. This district is intended to encourage less intense land use in environmentally sensitive areas. The comprehensive plan envisions lower density residential development (possibly by clustering) mixed with active or passive open space and recreation areas. 
(4)  MXI - Industrial Mixed Use. The MXI is intended to be similar to the MXC and MXT districts with the exception that certain light industrial uses are also permitted. 
(d)  General Use Standards. 
(1)  All business establishments shall be retail or service establishments dealing directly with consumers, except as provided for in the MXI district. 
(2)  All operations, activities and storage shall be conducted or maintained wholly inside enclosed buildings, with the exception of outdoor dining, automobile parking, off-street loading areas, parking during business hours of trucks and service vehicles owned or operated by the business, and storage of landscaping materials for retail sale, where any of these activities are allowed in conjunction with an approved use. 
(3)  Outdoor storage as defined in Chapter 19.01 of this Title shall not be permitted. 
(4)  All new principal buildings, structures and other uses shall be provided with public utilities and served by public streets. 
(e)  Parking and Circulation for all Multiple-Family and Nonresidential Uses. 
(1)  All premises shall be furnished with all-weather service walks, designed for the safety and convenience of pedestrians. Where external sidewalks or bicycle paths exist, connections to these shall be provided. 
(2)  Vehicular access to individual parcels shall be limited and controlled. When appropriate, existing driveways on the subject property or adjoining properties shall be combined and traffic circulation coordinated. Curb cuts shall be kept to the minimum number required to allow safe ingress/egress. 
Figure 21: Example of Limited Access 

(f)  Garages Required.

Detached garages shall be no larger than eight hundred square feet in area, and shall conform to district setback requirements for accessory structures. All garages shall meet the requirements of this Title and the most recently adopted construction codes. 
(g)  Front Yard Setback Exceptions. In the mixed use districts, the front yard setback requirements of this Title shall not apply to any lots where the average existing setback on lots located wholly or in part within one hundred feet on each side of such lot, within the same block and zoning district, and fronting on the same side of the street as such lot, is less than the minimum setback required. In such cases, setback on such lots may be less than the required setback but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the aforementioned lots or within ten feet, whichever is greater. 
(h)  Required Mix of Uses. A mix of uses, either within a single building or on a development site, shall be provided unless it can be demonstrated that adjacent properties provide a complimentary diversity of uses. Residential uses are encouraged, but are not permitted on the ground floor of mixed-use structures. Residential uses in separate buildings may be permitted if approved by the plan commission and village board as part of an overall mixed use area master plan. The uses allowed in any MX mixed use district shall be strictly based upon those uses specified for that area in the village's comprehensive plan in effect at the time of project approval.

19.08.020 - Runway protection zones and transition areas. 
A.  Intent. The purpose of the runway protection zones (RPZs) and transition areas is to preserve the unique assets that the airport offers to the village and to promote a more comprehensive and consistent land use pattern in the areas adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport. With the RPZ and transition area, certain requirements are established which apply over and above those set forth under the established zoning district for any affected building, structure, or use. These requirements are intended to regulate the development, growth, or construction of objects that may become hazards to air traffic utilizing the Chicago Executive Airport and that could endanger the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity. By enacting zoning standards, safety, and airport externalities can be monitored and controlled. 
B.  Runway Protection Zone and Transition Area Defined. The following areas, or so much thereof as are within the corporate boundaries of the village, hereby described with reference to the runways at the Chicago Executive Airport, are designated as the RPZ and transition area: 
1.  Runway Protection Zone. The dimensions of the RPZ depend on the type of runway. The following RPZ areas are depicted on the zoning map: 
a.  RPZ for a Precision Instrument Runway. With respect to runways designated as precision instrument runways, the area five hundred feet on either side of the centerline of the runway in width and extending two hundred feet from the end of the runway in both directions in length; plus that area lying directly under the approach surface, as defined and established in Section 19A.02.034 of Title 19A of the Wheeling Municipal Code, from two hundred feet from the end of the runway to one thousand seven hundred feet out from the end of the runway; and 
b.  RPZ for a Visual Runway Operational. With respect to runways designated as visual runways, the area two hundred fifty feet on either side of the centerline of the runway in width and extending two hundred feet from the end of the runway in length; plus that area lying directly under the approach surface, as defined and established in Section 19A.02.034 of Title 19A of the Wheeling Municipal Code, from two hundred feet outward from the end of the runway to one thousand two hundred twenty feet from the end of the runway. 
2.  Transition Area. The transitional surface, as defined in Section 19A.02.035 of Title 19A of the Wheeling Municipal Code, is a surface extending outward and upward at right or ninety-degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation of the primary surface and the approach surfaces extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right or ninety-degree angles to the runway centerline. 
C.  Construction in a Runway Protection Zone or Transition Area. 
1.  Within an RPZ or transition area, no building or structure shall be constructed, nor any improvement added to an existing building or structure, until such building, structure or improvement is determined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) not to be a hazard to aerial navigation. 
2.  No building permit or other license or permit shall be issued for any construction subject to this section until a determination of hazard to air navigation, or the equivalent of such determination, has been issued by the Federal Aviation Administration covering the proposed construction. Any permits issued for such construction shall be conditioned upon the construction remaining within the height limits of the plans submitted to the FAA, and upon compliance with any lighting or marking requirements specified by the FAA. 
D.  Limitations of Zoning Map Relative to the Airport Imaginary Surfaces. The village planner shall designate the RPZ and transition areas on the zoning map of the village, and shall cause to be prepared a detailed map showing the areas of the village included in such areas. It must be noted that the airport imaginary surfaces defined in Title 19A, Airport Zoning, of the Wheeling Municipal Code, are defined by an extent well beyond the perimeter of the RPZ and transition area at ground level. Due consideration shall be given to the review of all development proposals within the village of Wheeling relative to the airport imaginary surfaces. Areas depicted on the zoning map as outside of the RPZ and transition area may still require review by the FAA with respect to the other airport imaginary surfaces.

Chapter 19.09 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 
Sections: 

19.09.010 - Planned unit developments. 
(a)  Statement of Intent. The intent of the planned unit development ("PUD") approval process is to promote the maximum benefit from coordinated area site planning, by providing opportunities to maximize the economical and efficient use of land in ways that may not be possible under conventional zoning regulations. It is intended that planned unit developments established in the village provide a harmonious variety of uses and building types and a high level of amenities, in a manner that is consistent with plans for the area as set forth in the village of Wheeling's comprehensive plan. The procedure described in this Chapter is designed to give the developer initial plan approval before completing all detailed design work while providing the village with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the time of initial approval. 
(b)  Planned Unit Developments vs. Planned Developments. A planned unit development is a development which has received approval through the PUD approval process described within this Chapter. The village first adopted a PUD approval process on March 20, 1998 (Ordinance 3284). Prior to the adoption of a PUD approval process, many large multifamily residential developments were constructed in the village. These developments will be referred to as planned developments in this Title. 
(c)  General Provisions. 
(1)  Zoning Map Designators. All planned developments and planned unit developments shall be shown on the zoning map with an asterisk (*) and a number that corresponds to the table in Appendix C (Planned Unit Developments and Other Developments with Special Legislation). 
(2)  Application of Title 17: Wheeling Planning, Subdivisions and Developments Ordinance. To the extent applicable, any PUD shall be subject to the procedures and regulations of the Wheeling Subdivision and Development Ordinance. However, these design standards and required improvements may be modified or waived upon recommendation by the plan commission and approval by the board of trustees where strict compliance would result in failing to achieve the design flexibility necessary to achieve the objectives of the PUD. 
(3)  Locations Permitted. A PUD may be requested in the zoning districts listed in Appendix A (Use Table). If "planned unit development" is not specifically listed as a permitted or special use in a particular district, a petitioner must also request a rezoning of the property in conjunction with the request for PUD approval. 
(d)  Types of Applications. 
(1)  Concept Review and Workshop Discussion. This preliminary consultation with village staff and the board of trustees is mandatory prior to application for a planned unit development. See subsection (e)(2) of this section. Submittal requirements are detailed under subsection (e)(3) of this section. There is no formal approval associated with this type of application, though a new application must be submitted and reviewed if the concept is to be altered significantly prior to submittal of a preliminary or final PUD application. 
(2)  Preliminary Planned Unit Development Approval. This step provides the village with an opportunity to review a well-developed initial plan for the entire site before granting final approval for any proposed planned unit development, while at the same time providing the applicant with an opportunity to receive formal preliminary approval before developing detailed plans for the site. Submittal requirements for preliminary approval are detailed under subsection (e)(4) of this section. Requires a public hearing. No significant changes to the PUD plan are expected following preliminary PUD approval. 
(3)  Final Planned Unit Development Approval. Final planned unit development approval is required prior to construction. Submittal requirements are detailed under subsection (e)(5) of this section. Requires a public hearing in the following circumstances: 
a.  If more than six months have elapsed between the preliminary PUD ordinance approval and the submittal of the final PUD application. 
b.  If the final PUD plan is not in substantial conformance with the preliminary PUD plans. 
(4)  Multi-phase Planned Unit Developments. A multi-phase PUD must first receive Preliminary PUD approval. Each phase may be submitted for final PUD approval separately. 
(e)  Application Requirements. 
(1)  Submittal Timeline.

(1)  Use and Design Standards for all Planned Unit Developments. Every PUD shall meet the following standards: 
(A)  Uses. Permitted, special and accessory uses for each PUD shall be specified in the preliminary PUD application. Residential use may be proposed for any planned unit development. Nonresidential uses shall be consistent with the uses permitted in the underlying zoning district (see Appendix A, Use Table). With the exception of planned unit developments in an R-4 district, a mix of different uses within a PUD may be permitted if the plan commission and the board of trustees determine that the mix of uses is compatible and necessary to achieve the objectives of the PUD. Any additions or exceptions to the specified uses in those districts shall be specified at the time of preliminary PUD review and approval. 
(B)  Number of Buildings on a Lot. The PUD may allow more than one building on a lot. 
(C)  Density. The PUD may permit the grouping of dwelling units in one or more locations within the total site, however residential density for the site as a whole shall be consistent with that specified in the village's comprehensive plan. 
(D)  Minimum Area. The minimum lot area for a PUD is one acre, which may consist of one or more contiguous parcels. 
(E)  Space Between Structures. Spaces between structures shall not be less than required by the building code. 
(F)  Setbacks. The dimension of setbacks and limitations on their use in each PUD project shall be based on the regulations for the underlying zoning district. Variations to zoning regulations are often required to facilitate the construction of a planned development and will be established during the development review and approval process. When establishing the appropriate setbacks, explicit consideration will be given to existing conditions and proposed building heights. The plan commission may recommend and the village board may require that setback areas be landscaped and used only for recreation, utility rights-of-way, sidewalks, ponds, water detention basins and drainage channels. It may also be specified that setback areas are not to be used for parking or driveways except as they are used to provide direct access to the development. 
(G)  Circulation, Parking and Loading. Adequate pedestrian and vehicular access shall be provided into and throughout the development. Parking and loading facilities shall be located near the uses they support and shall be adequately screened and landscaped in a manner which meets or exceeds the requirements of this Title. Private streets are not permitted. 
(H)  Landscaping. All required vegetation shall be of a quality consistent with the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen (ANSI 260.1). All required vegetation shall be maintained on an ongoing basis, including seasonal tree and plant replacement. 
(I)  Lighting. See Section 19.11.040 of this Title for lighting regulations. 
(J)  Utilities and Mechanicals. 
(i)  Mechanical, electrical, communications and service equipment, including meters, shall be located inside the building whenever possible. Any roof- or wall-mounted equipment, including piping, shall be screened on all sides from public view by parapets, walls, or other approved means. Utility meters, gas regulator valves and the like shall not be placed on the street side of any building. 
(ii)  All ground level mechanical, electrical and transformers, communications and service equipment shall be screened with either plantings or a durable noncombustible enclosure which are unified and harmonious with the overall architectural theme of the building while meeting utility provider standards for location and maintenance. 
(iii)  All utility lines shall be installed underground. Transformers and substations shall be installed within buildings or otherwise screened from view. 
(K)  Signs. All signs in the PUD shall be included as part of the PUD application and are subject to the provisions of Title 21. 
(L)  Establishment of an Owners' Association. Should a PUD include multi-family residential property where property will be held in common ownership, the petitioner shall indicate the manner in which a single owners' association will be established. This shall include, but is not limited to, the proposed declaration of covenants and restrictions, articles of incorporation, and association by-laws. 
(2)  Use and Design Standards for PUDs and Planned Developments Established Prior to the Effective Date of this Title. All PUDs and other planned developments established prior to the effective date of this Title are subject to the standards established for the project at the time of their adoption. Any redevelopment or expansion of an existing planned unit development will require review as described in subsection (f)(7) of this section. Any redevelopment or expansion of an existing planned development will require review as described in subsection (f)(8) of this section. 
(3)  Conditions and Restrictions. PUDs shall be subject to the following conditions and restrictions: 
(A)  The plan commission may recommend and the board of trustees may adopt, by ordinance, conditions and restrictions for PUDs that specify permitted uses, set bulk regulations and density standards for lot coverage and dwelling unit size and distribution and yard setbacks. 
(B)  Conditions and restrictions adopted to govern any PUD may include nonstandard or nonuniform requirements, regulations, and provisions recommended by the plan commission and approved by the board of trustees. Such nonstandard requirements, regulations and provisions shall be designed to insure proper development and appropriate operation and maintenance of specific sites. 
(C)  The developer(s) shall enter into a written developer's agreement with the village to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including any conditions and restrictions adopted to regulate a specific PUD, and to assure the construction of all facilities and infrastructure associated with the project. 
(4)  Maintenance Standards. All projects are subject to the following maintenance requirements: 
(A)  Failure to Perform Maintenance. Should the owner(s) of a PUD fail to adequately perform maintenance functions such as snow and ice removal, weed cutting, or trash disposal, the village shall have the right, but not the duty, to perform such functions or to contract for their accomplishment at the property owner's expense. 
(B)  Failure to Prevent Nuisance. Should the owner(s) of a PUD fail to properly operate or maintain the business or premises to the extent that a nuisance is caused to occupants or neighbors, or constitutes a nuisance to nearby properties, the board of trustees may refuse to approve subsequent stages of development until such time as they determine that the situation and/or the method of operation has been corrected.

(Ord. No. 4491, § C, 1-4-2010) 
Chapter 19.10 - USE REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

19.10.010 - Reading the use table. 
    The village of Wheeling Use Table (see Appendix A, "Use Table," page 522-8) lists the uses allowed within each of the zoning districts in the village. Each zoning district is listed along the top of the table and each use is listed in the rows. A "P" in the box indicates that a use is permitted by right in the respective zoning district. An "S" in the box indicates that a particular use is classified as a special use and is allowed only under specific conditions outlined in Section 19.10.030 of this Chapter. If the box is blank, it indicates that a specific use is not permitted in that zoning district. 
(Ord. 4018 § A (part), 2005) 
19.10.020 - Similar use interpretations. 
(a)  Need and Authority for Similar Use Interpretations. Where a proposed unclassified or unspecified use is similar in character to a permitted or special use in a given district the village zoning administrator is authorized to make a similar use interpretation. At his discretion the matter may be referred to the plan commission for a final determination. The standards contained in this section shall guide similar use interpretations. 
(b)  Considerations Used in Making Similar Use Interpretations. The following considerations shall be used to determine what category a use is in and whether the activities are to be considered principal or accessory uses: 
(1)  The similarity of the proposed or projected use or activity to already-permitted uses and activities; 
(2)  The relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 
(3)  Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 
(4)  The type of customer for each activity; 
(5)  The relative number of employees in each activity; 
(6)  Hours of operation; 
(7)  Building and site arrangement; 
(8)  Vehicles used in the activity; 
(9)  The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the use or activity; 
(10)  Signage; 
(11)  How the use or activity advertises itself; 
(12)  Whether the use or activity is likely to be found independent of the other uses or activities on the site. 
(c)  Additional Standards for Similar Use Interpretations. 
(1)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be presented demonstrating that it will comply with all applicable use standards and all other applicable requirements and standards of this Title. 
(2)  No similar use interpretation shall permit any use in a zoning district unless the use is similar to other uses allowed in the zoning district and is more similar to such uses than to permitted and special uses allowed in other zoning districts. 
(3)  If the proposed use is more similar to a use allowed only as a special use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located, then any similar use interpretation permitting that use shall require a special use permit. 
(d)  Effect of Similar Use Interpretations. A similar use interpretation finding that a particular use is permitted or conditionally permitted as a special use in a specific district shall not automatically authorize the establishment of such use or the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure. It merely authorizes the preparation, filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the village of Wheeling's codes and ordinances or other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. These permits and approvals include, but are not limited to, special use permits, building permits and certificates of occupancy. 
(Ord. 4018 § A (part), 2005) 
19.10.030 - Special uses. 
(a)  Special Uses Defined. Special uses are those activities which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot ordinarily be allowed in a particular district without a consideration of their impact upon neighboring land uses and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. 
(b)  Prior Special Uses are Conforming. All uses existing as of the effective date of this Title which are classified in this Title as special uses in their respective zoning district are conforming as to their special use status. Any proposed change in their existing operation shall be subject to the procedures and provisions of the special use section of this Title. 
(c)  Approval Required. Any special use listed in this Title shall be permitted only when authorized by the village board in accordance with the procedures established in this Chapter. 
(d)  Application. Applications for a special use shall be made in duplicate to the village zoning administrator. The following information shall be provided at the time of application:

(2)  A written description of the special use, describing its unique characteristics, and a plan of operation describing the character of the operation in terms of its impact upon traffic facilities, storm drainage, sewage disposal, potable water supply, hours of operation and environmental character with particular emphasis on control of any possible noise, dust, odor, or other undesirable operating characteristics. 
(3)  All site plan approval information required under Section 19.12.040 of this Title, unless a written exemption is provided in advance by the village zoning administrator. 
(4)  Additional information as required by the plan commission or the village zoning administrator. 
(e)  Review and Approval Procedure. 
(1)  The plan commission shall hold a public hearing on all applications for special uses after public notice requirements are met. 
(2)  The plan commission shall review the site plan, existing and proposed structures, architectural plans, neighboring uses, parking areas, driveway locations, street access, traffic generation and circulation, drainage, sanitary and storm sewer, water systems, landscaping, park requirements and proposed operation. Conditions such as landscaping, architectural design, type of construction, construction commencement and completion dates, lighting, fencing, planting screens, hours of operation, traffic improvements, deed restrictions, increased yards, or parking requirements may be recommended by the plan commission upon its finding that these are necessary to fulfill the purpose and intent of this Title. 
(3)  Following the public hearing and review, the plan commission shall forward its written findings and recommendations with respect to the proposed special use to the village board. 
(4)  The village board is authorized to take action to approve by ordinance or deny the application for special use approval, following receipt of the plan commission recommendations. Ordinances regarding special use approvals shall make reference to a site plan attached to the ordinance codified in this Title as an exhibit. 
(5)  If an application for a proposed special use is not acted upon finally by the board of trustees within six months of the date upon which the findings and recommendations of the plan commission are filed with the board of trustees, it shall be deemed to have been denied. 
(f)  Compliance Required. Compliance with all other provisions of this Title, such as lot width and area, yards, height, parking, loading, traffic and highway access shall be required of all special uses. 
(g)  Standards. The corporate authorities shall adopt an ordinance allowing the establishment of a special use whenever it shall find that: 
(1)  The special use is necessary for the public convenience at that location; 
(2)  The special use will not alter the essential character of the locality in which it is to be located; 
(3)  The location and size of the special use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, the size of the site in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it, shall be such that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in which it is to be located; 
(4)  The location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences, and the nature and extent of the landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings, or will not impair the value thereof; 
(5)  Parking areas shall be of adequate size and for the particular use, properly located, and suitably screened from adjoining residential uses, and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances; 
(6)  The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulation in that zone. 
(h)  Special Standards for Specified Special Uses. When the zoning district regulations authorize a special use in a particular zoning district and that special use has additional standards set forth under Section 19.10.050 or 19.10.060 of this Title, a special use permit shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish compliance with all such standards. 
(i)  Revision. Any proposed change in the authorizing ordinance, or conditions, and site plan alterations that involve building size or integral changes to the design and location of proposed site elements, shall constitute a request for special use revision. These changes shall be submitted to the plan commission who shall make findings of fact and recommendations which shall be transmitted to the village board for their approval. Minor site plan additions or changes shall be submitted to the plan commission for site plan review approval. The decision to process site plan additions or changes as a special use revision will be the responsibility of the plan commission. 
(j)  Revocation. 
(1)  The village board, after public hearing, may revoke the special use permit at any time if it is not in compliance with the conditions imposed or if there has been substantial change in the development without prior written approval of said changes by the plan commission.

(Ord. No. 4607, § C, 5-16-2011) 
19.10.040 - Nonconforming buildings, structures and uses. 
(a)  Intent. Within the districts established by this Title there exist lots, buildings, uses of lands and structures which were previously lawful but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Title. It is the intent hereof to provide for the amortization of certain nonconformities, to permit some nonconformities to conditionally continue, and to insure that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, increased, expanded or extended, nor to be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(b)  Nonconforming Uses Permitted. Except as herein specified, any building, structure or use lawfully established and existing at the time of the enactment of this Title may be continued as a legal nonconforming building, structure or use although it does not conform to the provisions of this Title. Single-family dwellings and their accessory structures, when involuntarily annexed to the village, shall not be considered nonconforming as to their use or dimension. Properties involuntarily annexed to the village after December 31, 1994, are subject to additional provisions under subsection (l) of this section. 
(c)  Enlargement of Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, but the extension of a use to any portion of a building which portion is at the time of the adoption of this Title primarily arranged or designed for such nonconforming use, shall not be deemed to be an extension of a nonconforming use. 
(d)  Illegal Uses or Terminated Nonconforming Uses. Properties subject to zoning enforcement for an illegal use or termination of a nonconforming use prior to the date of the adoption of the ordinance codified in this Title are not eligible to continue as a nonconforming use and must be ceased. 
(e)  Restoration, Repairs and Alterations. Any remodeling involving structural alterations made in a nonconforming building shall not be rebuilt during its life exceed fifty percent of its assessed valuation at the time the building became nonconforming, nor shall the building be enlarged, unless the use therein is changed to a conforming use; provided, however, that a nonconforming building damaged by fire, explosion, tornado, earthquake, or similar uncontrollable cause to the extent of no more than fifty percent of its assessed value prior to the damage may be repaired or rebuilt within two years of the date of such damage, but not thereafter. Alterations required by law are not to be considered when calculating the fifty percent limit on lifetime improvements. 
(f)  Change of Use. 
(1)  A nonconforming use of a building or structure, or portion thereof, shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use, unless it is determined by the plan commission acting as the board of zoning appeals that the new nonconforming use is less intense than the existing nonconforming use based on factors including, but not limited to: 
(A)  Hours of operation; 
(B)  Number of parking spaces; 
(C)  Number of employees; 
(D)  Physical size of building relative to surrounding buildings; 
(E)  Design characteristics of building relative to design features of surrounding buildings; and 
(F)  Traffic generation. 
(2)  If it is determined by the plan commission acting as the board of zoning appeals that a change in nonconforming use will be entertained for the subject property, special use review and approval will then be required in accordance with provisions set forth under Section 19.10.030 of this Chapter. 
(g)  Discontinuation of Nonconforming Uses. 
(1)  Vacancy. A building or structure, all or substantially all of which is designed or intended for a use which is not permitted in the district in which it is located, which is or hereafter becomes vacant, and remains unoccupied or unused for a period of six months, shall not thereafter be occupied or used except in a manner which conforms to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Conformance Required. If a nonconforming use of land is discontinued for a period of six months, such use shall not thereafter be renewed, and any subsequent use of the land shall conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six months, any future use of the building and premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Title. 
(4)  Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault or action by the property owner or occupant or its agent, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this section. A change or transfer of ownership of a nonconforming structure or use shall not be considered a discontinuance of such nonconforming use. 
(h)  District Changes. The provisions of this section shall also apply to nonconforming uses in districts hereafter changed. 
(i)  Improvements to Nonconforming Buildings. Any building which is nonconforming only because of lot area or yard requirements may be rebuilt, remodeled, expanded upon or enlarged, provided that the improvements do not increase the degree of nonconformity. 
(j)  Use of Nonconforming Lots of Record. Where the owner of a lot of official record at the time of adoption of this Title does not own and cannot reasonably acquire sufficient adjacent land to enable him to conform to the yard and other requirements of this Title, such lot may be used as a building site by the same or subsequent owner provided that the setbacks and other requirements shall conform to the requirements for the zone in which it is located; and also provided that the owner of such lot did not, directly or indirectly, have legal Title to a lot(s) contiguous to such lot on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Title. 
(k)  Adjacent Nonconforming Lots in Common Ownership. When two or more parcels of land, each of which does not meet the minimum standards to qualify for a permitted use under the requirements of the use district in which they are located, are contiguous and are held in one ownership, they shall be maintained and used as one zoning lot for such use. 
(l)  Special Provisions Applying to Properties Involuntarily Annexed to the Village after December 31, 1994. 
(1)  When Applicable. Certain buildings, structures and uses are subject to the regulations of this subsection in addition to those regulations applying to all nonconforming buildings, structures and uses in the village, as set forth in the balance of this section. This subsection applies to all of those properties that were involuntarily annexed to the village after December 31, 1994 on which there is situated a building, structure or use that was lawfully established and existing as of December 31, 1994 where such building, structure or use does not conform to all of the regulations of the district in which it is located, with the exception of single-family residences and their accessory structures. In this subsection these buildings, structures and uses are referred to simply as "Nonconforming properties regulated under this subsection."

(B)  Structural Alterations. Upon submission and approval of a mitigation plan pursuant to subsection (l)(4) of this section, any nonconforming property regulated under this subsection may be structurally altered, including interior and exterior improvements to such structure; provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of other provisions of this section. 
(C)  Damage or Destruction. Upon submission and approval of a mitigation plan pursuant to subsection (l)(4) of this section, any nonconforming property regulated under this subsection that is damaged or destroyed to any extent, by any means not within the control of the owner thereof, may be repaired or restored to its original condition and the use may continue subject to the regulations of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such repairs and restorations shall be in strict conformity with the applicable zoning district regulations unless a building permit is fully applied for within six months after the date of such damage or destruction and restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such damage or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion within a maximum of two years from the time restoration is initiated. 
(D)  Expanding into Another Portion of Building. Upon submission and approval of a mitigation plan pursuant to subsection (l)(4) of this section, any nonconforming property regulated under this subsection may be extended, expanded, or enlarged within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that is vacant, otherwise not occupied by a legal conforming use, or newly created within the existing building or structure. 
(3)  Change to Another Nonconforming Use. Any nonconforming property regulated under this subsection shall have in place an approved mitigation plan pursuant to subsection (l)(4) of this section, before a nonconforming use may be replaced by a less intense nonconforming use under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to authorize any violation of other provisions of this section.

(iii)  In any one case, only three proposed mitigation plans may be submitted. If none of these plans are approved by the plan commission or village board within three years of the original notice to the property or business owner pursuant to Section 19.10.040 of this Title, then the nonconforming structure or use shall be subject to all provisions of this Title that apply to all nonconforming uses or structures existing within the village regardless of whether the property on which the nonconforming use or structure is situated was involuntarily annexed to the village.

(A)  Required Trees for Parking Lot Perimeter and Interior Applications. 
(i)  Shade or ornamental trees are required within the vehicular use area at a ratio of one tree for every fifteen parking spaces or fraction thereof, unless the plan commission grants an exception. The trees must be evenly distributed throughout the vehicular use area. 
(ii)  Where a landscape border or other landscape area abuts the vehicular use area, shade or ornamental trees within those landscaped areas may count toward the vehicular use area requirement, provided: 
A.  The trees are located within ten feet of the vehicular use area; 
B.  The number of trees that are provided within the vehicular use area is not reduced by more than fifty percent of the amount required; and 
C.  There is a minimum of one tree provided within the vehicular use area. 
(iii)  Trees shall be planted in such a way that they are protected from vehicle damage. 
(iv)  Existing trees of desirable species and quality that can be preserved, where grading does not cut them off from a reasonable supply of water and where the area under the canopy remains undisturbed, shall count toward the tree requirements for off-street parking areas on a tree-for-tree basis. 
(B)  Interior Landscaping for Off-Street Parking Areas. The interior parking lot landscaping standards of this section shall apply to all off-street parking lots and their vehicular use areas containing forty or more parking spaces. The intent of this section is to require landscaping within vehicular use areas; therefore, landscaping screens, planting strips and landscaping surrounding buildings shall not be considered as interior landscaping. 
(i)  A minimum of twenty square feet of interior landscaped island or landscaped peninsula shall be provided per parking stall. 
(ii)  The interior landscaping shall be provided within landscaped islands with a minimum area of two hundred square feet and peninsulas with a minimum area of one hundred square feet (measured inside curbs). The landscaped areas must be underlain by soil (not base course material), and shall be protected by curbing. The minimum width of these features shall be five feet (inside curbs). 
(iii)  The interior landscaping shall be placed so as to delineate driving lanes, define rows and generally mitigate the visual impact of the parking lot. 
(iv)  The interior landscaping shall be composed of a combination of hardy trees, shrubs, perennials, and groundcover that are able to tolerate winter salt and soot, and are underlain by a layer of decorative mulch and weed barrier where applicable. Where islands are used as retention/infiltration areas for stormwater management, they should be landscaped appropriately for that purpose. 
(v)  To ensure a diversity of color, texture, and multi-seasonal interest, the total number of proposed plants shall be comprised of a minimum of twenty-five percent evergreens, with a maximum of seventy percent. 
(vi)  The interior landscaping shall not exceed thirty inches in height at maturity when located within an identified vision triangle. 
(vii)  Landscaped islands or landscaped peninsulas that function as stormwater retention/infiltration areas shall be subject to the following: 
A.  Shall be a minimum of fifteen feet in width if used for this purpose; 
B.  Parking areas will sheet drain into the islands through curb cuts or other apertures; 
C.  Proposed plantings shall be tolerant of flood conditions. 
(C)  Screening for Off-Street Parking Areas. The perimeter parking lot screening standards of this section shall apply to all off-street parking areas for six or more vehicles or larger than two thousand square feet in area. 
(i)  On-site perimeter greenbelts at least eight feet in width shall be installed along any street frontage and six feet along all interior lot lines. The street frontage shall contain dense landscape screening which provides plantings at least eighteen inches high at planting and thirty inches high at maturity. This greenbelt may overlap greenbelts and bufferyards required under Section 19.11.020 of this Chapter. 
(ii)  Perimeter landscaping shall provide a semi-opaque screen at a minimum during the winter season. 
(iii)  Perimeter planting areas shall be designed to maintain and protect visibility at driveways and access points. 
(iv)  Berms may be utilized as part of the perimeter landscaping. 
(v)  Off-street parking areas, including aisles and driveways, shall be effectively screened year round, on each side of any off-street parking lot for six or more vehicles that adjoins any property used for residential purposes or situated in a residential district, by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge not less than five feet nor more than six feet in height. 
(d)  Quantity of Parking. 
(1)  Parking Lot Size May Be Limited. It is the village's intent to enhance stormwater management by limiting excessive impervious surface, therefore, parking lots in which the number of spaces significantly exceeds the minimum number required under this zoning ordinance shall be allowed only with specific and reasonable justification. 
(2)  Maximum Amount of Parking Established. 
(A)  Parking shall be limited to the following maximums with the intent of reducing impervious surfaces not needed for parking for uses on the site, to reduce flooding and increase green space for infiltration. 
Minimum Number of Required Parking Spaces Maximum Percentage Increase Allowed Over Required Parking 5 to 99 120% 100 to 249 115% 250 to 499 110% Over 500 105%  
(B)  When a parking structure is provided, the maximum percentage increase allowed may be exceeded if the existence of the parking structure reduces impervious surface by fifty percent over what would be the case without a parking structure. 
(3)  Potential Parking Reductions. 
[(A)  Reserved.] 
(B)  Shared Parking. The plan commission and village board may authorize as much as a forty percent reduction in the area to be paved for nonresidential off-street parking stalls when parking is shared by two or more properties under separate ownership provided that the uses have peak demand at different times and safe pedestrian connections are provided. A written shared parking agreement, signed by all parties, shall be approved by a resolution of the village board, following receipt of plan commission recommendations. The agreement shall state a minimum time frame for the agreement to be in effect; provide for ingress/egress easements; and be recorded with the recorder of deeds for Cook or Lake County as a covenant. 
(C)  Shopping Center Parking Reductions. For single-use shopping centers, please see the parking table [Table 19.11.010(E)1(c)] for required parking. For shopping centers under a single owner or manager that have at least three (3) tenant spaces, the following reduction can be authorized by ordinance of the Village Board during site plan approval or special use approval: 
(i)  For shopping centers with a total leasable area of forty thousand square feet or greater, the parking requirement for each use may be reduced by fifteen percent, provided that the overall ratio for the shopping center is greater than or equal to 3.75 stalls per one thousand square feet of floor area. 
(ii)  For shopping centers with a total leasable area of sixty thousand square feet or greater, the parking requirement for each use may be reduced by twenty-five percent, provided that the overall ratio for the shopping center is greater than or equal to 3.6 stalls per one thousand square feet of floor area. 
(D)  Land-Banking of Reserved Parking Area. When a parking reduction has been authorized, the plan commission and village board may require that sufficient area on the property be held in reserve for the potential future development of paved off-street parking to meet the full requirements. When required, this reserve off-street parking area shall be shown and noted on the site plan, maintained as open space, and developed with paved off-street parking spaces when the village determines that such off-street parking is necessary due to parking demand on the property which exceeds original expectations. The reserve parking area may not be counted as part of any required green space area. The village may require that a letter of credit or other approved financial surety be provided at the time of permit issuance in an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty-five percent of the estimated cost of parking lot completion, to be exercised at village discretion, should the need for parking lot completion be determined. A land-banking agreement shall require approval by resolution of the village board, and shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds for Cook or Lake County as a covenant. 
(e)  Parking Standards. 
(1)  Minimum Required Parking Per Land Use Category. The following Table 19.11.010(e)(1)(C), describes the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for each specified use and any uses deemed to be similar. The table describes the required ratio of parking spaces to building size or tenant space; any fractional parking space is to be rounded up to the nearest whole number. Parking requirements are based on the gross square footage of the building or unit. The requirements apply in all zoning districts and for all uses in the village of Wheeling with the following exceptions: 
(A)  Infill and Redevelopment Projects. For infill and redevelopment projects parking shall be provided to meet these requirements where feasible, however it is recognized that there may be limitations on the availability of parking area due to existing lot sizes and development patterns, and the plan commission is authorized to grant exceptions in such cases when good cause is shown. 
(B)  Unified Shopping Centers. In unified shopping centers over ten thousand square feet in total area, with three or more separate businesses, the plan commission and village board may allow a general parking standard of one space per two hundred fifty square feet, even if any individual use(s) may require a more intensive parking standard.

19.11.030 - Vision clearance at intersections. 
(a)  Purpose and Intent. To provide clear vision for motorists at intersections where the grade is not separated, there shall be a vision clearance triangle at the intersection of any streets with railroads, alleys, or nonresidential driveways. 
(b)  Vision Triangle Requirements. 
(1)  The vision clearance triangle shall be determined by measuring twenty feet along the right-of-way, property lines, or driveway centerlines starting from the point of intersection of such lines, and connecting these two points with a line to define a triangular area. The village zoning administrator may adjust the vision clearance triangle configuration where physical site conditions exist that may adversely affect public safety. 
(2)  In the vision clearance triangle, no structures of any kind or landscaping or parked vehicles shall be permitted between three feet and ten feet above the centerline grade elevations of the intersecting streets, alleys or railroad tracks. 
(3)  Allowable installations in the vision clearance triangle are utility and light poles when no safer alternative location exists; trees or plant species with growth patterns that will not develop significant foliage to obstruct views in the clearance area; official signs and signals; and on-street parking when traffic controls exist which permit decreased sight lines. 
(4)  The configuration of vision clearance triangles shall be depicted on the site plan, or subdivision plat, or certified survey map required for the subject property including a notation referencing these restrictions. 
(5)  Exceptions to these vision clearance requirements include new buildings but only upon the prior approval of the village board following recommendation of the zoning administrator and plan commission; and buildings or structures existing prior to the date of this Title or amendments thereto.

(Ord. 4018 § A (part), 2005) 
19.12.060 - Site plan and appearance review procedure. 
(a)  Site Plan and Appearance Review-General Procedure. This section applies to new requests for site plan and building elevation plan review. Such requests shall be reviewed by the zoning administrator in accordance with Section 19.12.030. The zoning administrator shall determine whether the work is to require major review or minor review, as described below. Site plan and appearance changes that are found, at the determination of the zoning administrator, to have little to no impact may proceed to permit review. At the discretion of the zoning administrator, the request may be forwarded to the plan commission to complete this determination. 
(1)  Major Site Plan and Appearance Review. Major site plan and appearance review requires a concept review by the village board, a recommendation by the plan commission, and a final decision by the village board. The village manager, at his discretion, may waive the requirement for concept review for matters determined to be of a routine nature. Such determinations shall be made following consultation with the director of community development. Major site plan and appearance review shall be required for the following: 
a.  New construction of a principal structure. 
b.  Addition to an existing principal structure that is one thousand square feet or ten percent of the area of the existing structure, whichever is less. 
c.  Replacing the primary exterior building material on visible portions of the facade of an existing principal structure. 
d.  Significant site alterations, including, but not limited to, berms, detention/retention areas, parking lot addition/removal, or significant landscaping features. 
(2)  Minor Site Plan and Appearance Review. Minor site plan and appearance review requires a final decision by the plan commission. Minor site plan and appearance review shall be required for the following: 
a.  New construction of an accessory structure. 
b.  Addition to an existing principal structure that is less than one thousand square feet or less than ten percent of the area of the existing structure. 
c.  Replacing building materials, other than the primary building material, on visible portions of the facade of an existing principal structure. 
d.  Minor site alterations, such as parking lot modifications of a limited scope, fencing, minor grading, or small landscaping areas. 
(b)  Revisions to Approved Plans. This section applies to requests to modify recently approved site plans or building elevations, and is intended for projects that have not received final occupancy permits or final inspections. The village board and plan commission shall be informed of all such decisions. The director of community development shall make the determination as to whether a particular site plan revision constitutes a major, minor, or administrative change. Site plan revision decisions will be made with an understanding of the construction process. The director will consult with the fire department, village engineer, and the village planner to make this determination. The most important factor in the decision will be the intent of the plan commission and village board approval. The director may also determine that additional review by the plan commission or village board is required for any type of site plan revision. Three types of site plan and appearance revisions are possible: 
(1)  Major Change. Requires review and approval by the village board following receipt of a recommendation by the plan commission. Major change includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  The building setback is modified by ten percent or more from the original approval. 
b.  The driveway shifts location more than five feet. 
c.  The detention/retention pond changes from "soft" sides to concrete walls. 
d.  The fire lane/access changes location more than two feet and/or shortens in length. 
e.  Changes in final grade more than eighteen inches. 
f.  Changes to the approved appearance of the building involving significant portions of the facade such as modifications of the materials or colors. 
(2)  Minor Change. At minimum, requires review and approval by the plan commission. Minor change includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  The building shifts location by more than one foot but less than ten percent from the original approval. 
b.  The driveway shifts location by more than one foot but less than five feet. 
c.  The detention/retention pond changes significantly in width, depth, or location. 
d.  The fire lane/access changes location less than two feet. 
e.  Landscaping is modified in such a way that is interpreted to be inconsistent with the spirit of the original approval. 
(3)  Administrative Change. At minimum, requires review and approval by the director of community development. Includes changes to the site plan or building exterior (such as grading, landscaping, accent materials on the elevations) that may be required due to site conditions that arise that have less than a minor impact on the project, but still meet the intent of the approval.

(a)  Plan Commission Acting as the Zoning Board of Appeals. The zoning board of appeals is established for the purpose of hearing appeals and reviewing applications, for variances and exceptions to the provisions of this zoning ordinance.

b.  A public hearing shall be held on the application within ninety days and notice shall be given as follows: Notice of such hearing shall be published at least once, not more than thirty nor less than fifteen days before the hearing, in one or more newspapers published within the village, or if no newspaper is published therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general circulation within the village.

(2)  Standards and Findings. No variation from the provisions of this Title shall be granted by the board of trustees unless it finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all of the following facts and conditions exist and so indicates in the minutes of its proceedings. 
a.  Physical Conditions vs. Convenience. That there are present actual physical conditions applying to the lot, parcel, building, structure, use or intended use on that premises which are creating the practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship in the application of this Title, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to the owner if the strict letter of the regulations are required. 
b.  Unique vs. General Conditions. That the conditions are unique, exceptional, extraordinary or unusual circumstances applying only or primarily to the property under appeal and are not of such a general or recurrent nature elsewhere in the same zoning district as to suggest or establish the basis for future variations, ordinance changes or amendments. 
c.  Conditions Not Created by Appellant. That the alleged conditions creating the difficulty or hardship were not caused by the appellant nor by any person still having an interest in the property. A self-imposed hardship is not a basis for granting a variation, nor are financial concerns. 
d.  Reasonable Return. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulation in that zone. 
e.  Essential Character. The granting of the variation will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
f.  Environmental Quality. The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.

If an application for a proposed variation is not acted upon finally by the board of trustees within six months of the date upon which the findings and recommendations of the plan commission are filed with the board of trustees, it shall be deemed to have been denied.

The new official zoning map may correct drafting errors or other omissions on the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map or any subsequent amendment thereto. The new official zoning map shall be identified by bearing the seal of the village under the following words: "This is to certify that this Official Zoning Map supersedes and replaces the Official Zoning Map adopted as part of Ordinance No. 4018 of the Village of Wheeling, Illinois."

APPENDIX C - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WITH SPECIAL LEGISLATION 
    Planned Developments and PUDs. The following table lists the planned developments and PUDs in the Village of Wheeling. The number for each development corresponds to a number on the zoning map. The Village of Wheeling first adopted a PUD approval process on March 20, 1998 (Ordinance 3284). Prior to the adoption of the PUD approval process, many larger multifamily developments were constructed in the Village of Wheeling. These developments are referred to as "planned developments" in the Zoning Code to distinguish them from PUDs (see Chapter 19-01 Definitions and Chapter 19-09 Planned Unit Developments).

Section I. General Regulations 
_____
A. Intent and Purpose 
For buildings other than single-family residences, the architectural review of all new buildings and building additions shall be subject to the review of the Plan Commission and Village Board as described in Title 19, Zoning, of the Wheeling Municipal Code. 
It is the intent of the Village of Wheeling through these Design Guidelines to establish architectural design standards for buildings throughout the Village's residential areas, commercial corridors, and industrial parks. 
The purpose of these regulations is to: encourage development that is compatible with and complementary to the surrounding area, promote the use of high-quality and durable building materials, provide for an attractive built environment for Wheeling residents and businesses, and strengthen the character of each area by ensuring that development is well-planned and coordinated. 
B. Relationship to site and surroundings 
1. Each building shall be designed to facilitate its intended use. Entrances for the public, employees, and service/delivery shall be appropriately located with respect to streets, drive aisles, and parking areas. 
2. Building materials shall be of comparable aesthetic quality on all sides, though consideration for reduced architectural detail on elevations that are not visible from streets or adjacent properties may be made during the review process. 
C. Building Massing and Form 
The design elements on a building shall be appropriate for the scale of the development. Large featureless walls lacking articulation or variation in texture are not permitted in visible locations. This section describes design guidelines related to massing and form. See sections IV-VII of the Design Guidelines for specific requirements for residential, commercial, industrial, and mixed-use buildings. 

Blank walls facing the public street are discouraged 
1. Articulation. Walls shall be designed with recesses and projections such that large expanses of visible walls are not on the same plane. 
2. Horizontal division. Traditional architecture divides a building into a base, main body, and cap. Larger or more textured materials are frequently used in the base. The cap should distinguish the top of the building from the middle through the use of varied roof lines, accent materials, or overhangs. 
3. Roof lines. Variation in the roof line can be used to break up the façade of a building and create shadows. 
4. Accent lines. Subtle interruptions in the wall, such as vertical or horizontal accent lines, may also be appropriate, especially in industrial or office buildings. 
5. Architectural detail. Bay windows, cornice detail, overhanging eaves, brick patterns giving the appearance of windows or doors, and similar architectural detail is encouraged. 
6. Entry features. Emphasizing entry features through the use of alternate materials, a separate roof area, recesses/projections, or similar techniques is encouraged. 

Traditional base, body, and cap building. Visual interest is produced through articulation. Portions of the exterior wall are recessed 

Multiple roof lines and emphasis on the public entrance 
D. Windows and Doors 
1. Proportion. Windows and doors shall be of an appropriate dimension for the subject wall. 
2. Spacing and alignment. Windows should be spaced at regular intervals and aligned with each other. Windows should also be aligned in relationship to the other design features on the building (base material, horizontal accent lines, etc.). 
3. Materials. Windows and doors shall be constructed using materials that are complementary to the building materials. The color of the windows and doors should be consistent with the trim on the building. The use of tinted or mirrored glass is strongly discouraged and must be clearly presented during the appearance review process. 
4. False windows. Blank walls may be enhanced through the use of features that give the appearance of windows (spandrel glass, rectangular area with an alternate brick pattern, etc.). 
5. Films and decorative covers. Window coverings are subject to appearance approval as described in Title 19 and Title 21 of the Wheeling Municipal Code. 

Proportional windows, spaced on each section of the facade. 

Window frame feature on blank wall. 
E. Screening of Mechanical Equipment, Utilities, and Service Areas 
1. Rooftop units. Rooftop units shall be screened from view from the adjacent public streets and parking areas by the use of parapet walls or pad-mounted screen systems. A sight line diagram illustrating parapet screening may be required if it is not clear that the parapet will provide adequate screening. 
2. Trash enclosures, ground level units, and generators. Ground level mechanical units, such as air conditioning condensers and generators, shall be screened. The screening material shall be compatible with the overall architectural character of the development and shall be of a height to provide adequate screening. Materials such as brick, precast concrete, cedar, and composite wood are permitted. Gates should be durable and should be mounted on posts separate from the walls of the enclosure. When possible, such screened areas should also be incorporated into the site's landscaping scheme. 
3. Utility connections. Utility connections should be screened from view or incorporated into the service area. Exterior gas pipes and utility meters shall not be visible. 
4. Service areas. Service areas, such as delivery docks and compactor rooms, shall be located such that they are not directly visible from public streets or public parking areas. Screen walls matching the architectural design of the building shall be required for all visible service areas. 

Screen system for rooftop mechanical units. 
_____
Section II. Materials 
_____
A. General provisions 
1. Primary material. Each building shall utilize a single primary material within the main body of each elevation. Alternate materials may be used in the base and cap. Buildings which are specifically designed to give the appearance of distinct and separate buildings (such as town homes, row homes, or store fronts) may be interpreted for the purpose of this section as being separate buildings as divided along the unit lines. 
2. Accent materials. Accent materials typically represent 10% to 30% of each building elevation. See Sections IV-VII for specific regulations for Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed-Use, and Special Purpose buildings. 
3. Features such as windows, doors, trim, gutters, and downspouts, should be included in the plans, and should be consistent with the colors and materials on the structure. 
4. Durability and climate-appropriate construction. Materials shall be durable against weathering in the local climate. 
5. Porous materials. Porous materials, which are difficult to clean and prone to staining, are not permitted. 
6. New construction vs. renovations and additions. New buildings must comply with the regulations of the Design Guidelines. Additions and renovations on existing buildings that are eligible for Minor Site Plan and Appearance review as defined in the Zoning Code may be allowed to continue the use of materials that might otherwise be restricted. If a material is no longer available, the Plan Commission may determine that a substitute material provides a comparable appearance. 

Brick rowhomes with metal accents. 
B. Permitted materials 
See Sections IV-VII of the Design Guidelines for specific regulations for Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed-Use, and Special Purpose buildings. The following materials are permitted, and are listed below in order of preference: 
1.  Brick. Full masonry unit bricks are the preferred material for most types of construction. Utility size brick or jumbo bricks may not be used as a primary material on buildings less than 20' in height. 
2.  Stone. Stone is generally utilized as an accent material or in the building base. 
3.  Synthetic stone. Non-porous synthetic stone is permitted and used in place of natural stone. Textured synthetic stone may be used as a base or accent. 
4.  Concrete. Poured-in-place concrete is typically used for industrial buildings, but may also be appropriate for limited use in other buildings if it is modified with textures and stains to provide a visually interesting appearance. 
5.  Pre-cast concrete. Pre-cast concrete may be utilized in similar locations to poured-in-place concrete. Precast with brick inlays in the form may be utilized in place of brick. 
6.  Metal panel systems. Architectural panels may be appropriate for commercial structures, but are limited to use as an accent material in residential buildings. Metal panels must be durable in the given location, and may not be reflective. 
7.  Wood. Wood may be utilized as an accent material. Composite wood may be utilized as a trim material or in fencing/screening applications. 
8.  Cement-fiber board siding and cement-fiber panels. Materials such as Hardie panel may be appropriate for use in a variety of locations (see specific regulations for Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Mixed-Use, and Special Purpose buildings). Such materials may require certification of proper installation techniques, including the selection of the appropriate panel thickness for this climate. 
9.  Masonry panel systems. Panelized brick or cement fiberboard with a masonry unit appearance may be considered as an accent material. 
10.  Stucco. Stucco (cement roughly 1/2? thick on lath) may be appropriate for use as an accent material. 
11.  Vinyl siding. Vinyl siding may be permitted as an accent material in residential construction, or in a commercial development with a traditional character (such as a decorative gable area). Such siding shall be high quality and textured, while smooth surface siding is prohibited. 
12.  EIFS. Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems (EIFS, a coat of cement up to 1/4? thick on a fiberglass mesh and insulation board ) are not permitted in high traffic areas, near the ground level, or as a primary building material. 
13.  Additional materials. Materials not listed in these Design Guidelines may be permitted through the design review process provided that it can be demonstrated that the material is consistent with the intent of the Design Guidelines in terms of durability and compatibility with the character of the area. 
C. Prohibited materials 
1. Aluminum siding. Aluminum siding is easily dented. 
2. Concrete block/CMU. 
3. Split-face CMU and porous synthetic stone. These materials are difficult to clean and are prone to staining. 
4. Panels and boards not listed as permitted (sheet metal, corrugated metal, plastic, plywood, fiberglass, etc.). 
D. Methods of Measuring Building Materials 
For the regulations in the Design Guidelines that specify minimum or maximum percentages of a material, the following methods of measurement shall be utilized: 
1. Percentage of a wall. The wall surface area shall be measured from grade to the top of the wall. Standard windows and doors within the primary material will be included in the measurement for primary building material calculations. Sub-roof areas (such as a roof over a porch) are not included in the overall surface area of the wall. 
2. Garage doors. See specific regulations in sections IV-VII regarding garage doors. 
3. Maximum use of an accent material. If standard windows and doors are placed within an accent material, the window and door area will be added to the accent material surface area. 
4. If a single building is intended to have the appearance of multiple buildings, such as attached row homes or store fronts in a retail building, then multiple primary materials may be used. The building wall as a whole must comply with the minimum standards for the building type as described Sections IV-VII. 

Standard windows and doors are calculated as part of the building wall. Different units may use different primary materials, but the building as a whole must comply with the minimum standards for the building type (see regulations for residential structures). 
_____
Section III. Colors 
_____
A. Exterior building colors 
1. Building colors shall be subdued in tone and of a low reflectance.

Chapter 19A.02 - AIRPORT IMAGINARY SURFACES AND HEIGHT LIMITATIONS 

19A.02.010 - Airport imaginary surfaces- Generally. 
    The airport imaginary surfaces designated in this chapter are established with relation to the airport and to each runway. The size of each imaginary surface is based on the category of each runway according to the type of approach available or planned for that runway. The slope and dimensions of the approach surface applied to each end of a runway are determined by the most precise approach existing or planned for that runway end. 
    Airport imaginary surfaces are designated and established in order to carry out the provision of this title. Such surfaces shall include all of the land lying within the horizontal surface, conical surface, primary surface, or approach surface to include nonprecision instrument approach, precision instrument approach and visual approach, transitional surface and circling approach surface. An area located in more than one of the designated surfaces is considered to be only in the surface with the more restrictive height limitation. 
(Ord. 1621 § A (part), 1979) 
19A.02.020 - Height restrictions-Generally. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this title, no structure or growth shall be erected, created, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any surface designated by this title to a height in excess of the height established for such surface in this title. 
(Ord. 1621 § A (part), 1979) 
19A.02.030 - Airport imaginary surfaces- Designated. 
    The various airport imaginary surfaces are designated, and height limitations are established for each of the surfaces, as specified in Sections 19A.02.031 through 19A.02.036.

The radius of each arc is: 
(1)  Five thousand feet for all runways designated as utility or visual; and 
(2)  Ten thousand feet for all other runways. 
(b)  The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest determined for either end of the runway. When a five thousand foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two adjacent ten thousand foot arcs, the five thousand foot arc shall be disregarded on the designation of the perimeter of the horizontal surface. The horizontal surface does not include the approach and transitional surfaces.

(v)  Four thousand feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway, other than utility, having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute mile; and, 
(vi)  Sixteen thousand feet for precision instrument runways. 
(2)  The approach surface extends for a horizontal distance of: 
(i)  Five thousand feet at a slope of twenty feet horizontally for each foot vertically for all utility and visual runways; 
(ii)  Ten thousand feet at a slope of thirty-four feet horizontally for each foot vertically for all nonprecision instrument runways other than utility; and, 
(iii)  Ten thousand feet at a slope of fifty feet horizontally for each foot vertically with an additional forty thousand feet at a slope of forty feet horizontally for each foot vertically for all precision instrument runways. 
(3)  The outer width of an approach surface to an end of a runway will be that width prescribed in this subsection for the most precise approach existing or planned for that runway end. 
(Ord. 1621 § A (part), 1979) 
19A.02.035 - Transitional surface. 
    The transitional surface is a surface extending outward and upward at right or ninety-degree angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation of the primary surface and the approach surfaces extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation. Transitional surfaces for those portions of the precision approach surface which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach surface and at right or ninety-degree angles to the runway centerline. 
(Ord. 1621 § A (part), 1979) 
19A.02.036 - Circling approach surface. 
    The circling approach surface is a surface two hundred feet above ground level or above the airport elevation, whichever is greater, within three nautical miles of the airport reference point and this surface increases in height in the proportion of one hundred feet for each additional nautical mile of distance from the airport reference point to a maximum of five hundred feet. 
(Ord. 1621 § A (part), 1979) 
19A.02.037 - Excepted height limitations. 
    Nothing in this title shall be construed as prohibiting the growth, construction or maintenance of any growth or structure to a maximum height of fifty feet above the surface of the land in its natural state.

(Ord. 1427 § A (part), 1976) 
20.02.060 - Responsibility. 
    Failure of the village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend denial of the site development permit, or of the zoning board of appeals to deny said permit, shall not relieve the permittee from responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and shall not result in the village, its officers or agents being responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom. 
(Ord. 1427 § A (part), 1976) 
20.02.070 - Retention of plans. 
    Plans, specifications and reports for all site developments shall be retained in original form or on microfilm by the permit officer.

(Ord. 1427 § A (part), 1976) 
20.03.030 - Special precautions. 
A.  If at any stage of the grading the permit officer determines by inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, the permit officer may require, as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and reports of a registered soils engineer and/or of a registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work. The costs of said reports shall be the responsibility of the permittees. 
B.  Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take such other measures or may be required to protect adjoining property or public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the permit officer may specify the time of starting the grading and time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.

(Ord. 4183 § A (part), 2007) 
22.14.080 - Compensatory storage. 
    Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. This compensatory storage requirement shall not be applicable for any existing lot platted and of record prior to the adoption of this Title unless in the determination of the village engineer such exemption will cause increased flood height or damage.

22.14.090 - Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). 
    A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The village engineer shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following: 
(a)  Compensatory storage shall be provided per Section 22.14.080. 
(b)  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the Flood Protection Elevation (FPE). 
(c)  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the village engineer may waive the ten-foot minimum setback if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the village engineer for review. The village engineer may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(d)  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the village engineer may waive the twenty-foot minimum setback distance if an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to the hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
(e)  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
(f)  The fill material must be homogenous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
(g)  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
(h)  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five feet below the BFE. 
(i)  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-fourth horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
(j)  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
(k)  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
(l)  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the village engineer may allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detained engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by an Illinois Registered Professional Engineer. 
(m)  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed eighteen inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

(Ord. 4183 § A (part), 2007) 
22.16.060 - Technical requirements. 
    Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of Chapter 22.20. 
(a)  Preservation of Flood Conveyance, so as not to Increase Flood Stages Upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(1)  Regulatory floodway conveyance. 
K = 1.486 AR 2/3 N  
    where "N" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.) 
(2)  The same Manning's "N" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
(3)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. 
    The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(A)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(B)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(C)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
(D)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(E)  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
(b)  Preservation of Floodway Storage so as not to Increase Downstream Flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed one-hundred-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at an existing structure. 
(c)  Preservation of Floodway Velocities so as not to Increase Stream Erosion or Flood Heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency event. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
(d)  Construction of New Bridges or Culvert Crossings and Roadway Approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 feet, the developer must contact IDNR-OWR, Dam Safety Section for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
(1)  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions or the flood study specified in Chapter 22.12. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly accepted FEMA approved hydraulic. 
(2)  Lost floodway storage must be compensated as per subsection (b) of this section. 
(3)  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (c) of this section. 
(4)  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a Department of Transportation permit must be received. 
(5)  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required per Section 22.16.050. 
(6)  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection (h) of this section. 
(e)  Reconstruction or Modification of Existing Bridges, Culverts, and Approach Roads. 
(1)  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the one-hundred-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
(2)  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages or upstream and downstream properties. 
(3)  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the Department of Transportation Rules 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(f)  On-stream Structure Built for the Purpose of Backing Up Water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or with existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR, Dam Safety Section for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in Section 22.06.130 shall meet the permitting requirements of 17 Ill. Adm. Code 3702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(1)  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
(2)  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
(3)  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
(4)  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
(5)  The project otherwise complies with the requirement of Chapter 22.16. 
(g)  Floodproofing of Existing Habitable, Residential and Commercial Structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
(h)  Excavation in the Floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(1)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length; 
(2)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; 
(3)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used; 
(4)  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
(i)  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(1)  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
(2)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
(3)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(A)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practicable, 
(B)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion, 
(C)  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation, 
(D)  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel, 
(E)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three is to one horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods of bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives, 
(F)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of vegetative cover, 
(G)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate, 
(H)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality, 
(I)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel, 
(J)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project, 
(K)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
(4)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of Chapter 22.16. 
(j)  Seeding and Stabilization Plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
(k)  Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
(1)  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
(2)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within fifteen days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen days to denuded areas which may not be at a final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty days. 
(3)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
(4)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty-five feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels. Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
(5)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
(l)  Public Flood Control Projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the one-hundred-year frequency event. 
(m)  General Criteria for Analysis of Flood Elevations. 
(1)  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in Chapter 22.12, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
(2)  If the one-hundred-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the one-hundred-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
(3)  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(n)  Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. 
    However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
(o)  Professional Engineer's Supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
(p)  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty-five feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
(1)  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty-five feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel. 
(2)  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
(3)  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided, when necessary, for stream maintenance purposes. 
(q)  After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built" plans.

(Ord. 4183 § A (part), 2007) 
22.16.100 - Exemptions from professional engineer's review. 
    The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this Chapter, including the mitigation requirements. 
(a)  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
1.  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
2.  Do not involve the placement of above ground structures in the floodway other than supporting towers or overhead utilities; or 
3.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream bed; or
