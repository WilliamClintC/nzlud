whenever authorized or directed by the city commission. A supplement to the Code shall
include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances adopted during the
period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a
supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where

of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and
titles;

"this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ____________ to
____________" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which
embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of
ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any
change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or
already embodied in the Code.
§ 1-13. Severability of parts of Code.
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city commission that the sections,
paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase,
clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by
the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality
shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of
this Code.
(Code 1962, § 1-5)
§ 1-14. Altering Code.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation in the city to change or amend by

will cause the law of the City of Lake Wales to be misrepresented thereby.

(h) No contracts for the construction, repair, or alteration of any facility or part of the
same, or the purchase of equipment, services, or supplies involving an expenditure of more
than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) shall be awarded by the authority unless the
authority advertises for sealed bids at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks and
such contract is awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. However, the authority may
reject all bids.
(i) The Lake Wales Airport Authority, as hereby created, is authorized and empowered to
enter into contracts with any individual, corporation, political subdivision, or agency of the
state, and the United States of America, and to enter into operating contracts and/or leases
for facilities owned by said airport authority and any and all other contracts for furthering
the business, operation, and maintenance of said facilities as hereinbefore provided,
including the right to lease any or all of such facilities and appurtenances to individuals,
corporations, or government entities. The authority is further authorized to fix and revise
from time to time rate, fees, and other charges for the use of and for the services furnished
or to be furnished by any facilities owned or operated by the authority. Such rates, fees, and
charges shall be fixed and revised so that the revenues of the authority, together with any
other available funds, will be sufficient at all times to pay the cost, including salaries, for
maintaining, operating, and repairing the airport facilities owned or operated by the
authority, including reserves for such purposes, and to pay the principal or interest on all
bonds or revenue certificates issued by the authority under the provisions of this Ordinance
as the same shall become due and payable and to provide reserves therefor.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the authority may enter
into contracts relating to the use of or for the services furnished or to be furnished by any
such facilities which shall not be subject to revision except in accordance with their terms.
(j)

(1)The authority is hereby authorized to issue, at one (1) time or from time to time, bonds or
revenue certificates of the authority for the purpose of paying the cost of acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, improving, extending, enlarging, or equipping any of its
facilities. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not
exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, and shall bear interest at such rate or
rates as may be determined by the authority, not exceeding the maximum rate of interest on
bonds allowed by the state, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the
authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the
authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form and the
manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest to be attached thereto, and shall fix
the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of
principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state.
In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any
bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such
signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the
same as if he or she had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any of the
other provisions of this section or any recitals in any bonds issued under the provisions of
this section, all such bonds shall be deemed to be negotiable instruments under the laws of
the State of Florida. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the
authority may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon
bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the
reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The
authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such
price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the authority, but no such sale shall be
made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at
more than the maximum rate of interest on bonds allowed by the state, computed with relation
to the absolute maturity or maturities of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond
values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on
redemption of any bonds at more than the maximum rate of interest on bonds allowed by the
state, computed with relation to the absolute maturity or maturities of the bonds in accordance
with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount
of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.
(2) The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purpose for
which such bonds shall have been authorized and shall be disbursed in such manner and
under such restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing
the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the
same. Unless otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution or in the trust agreement
securing such bonds, if the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise,
shall be less than such costs, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide
the amount of such deficit and shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be
entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first
issued for the same purpose.
27/246
(3) The resolution providing for the issuance of bonds, and any trust agreement securing
such bonds, may also contain such limitations upon the issuance of additional bonds as
the authority may deem proper, and such additional bonds shall be issued under such
restrictions and limitations as may be prescribed by such resolution or trust agreement.
(4) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions,
issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for
definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery.
The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become
mutilated or be destroyed or lost.
(5) Bonds may not be issued under the provisions of this section without obtaining the
prior consent of the city commission.
(6) Bonds issued by the authority under the provisions of this section shall not be
deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Lake Wales or a pledge of the faith and credit
of the city, but such bonds shall be obligations of the authority payable solely from the
funds herein provided therefor, and a statement to that effect shall be recited on the face
of the bonds.
(7) The maximum rate of interest on bonds allowed by the state is determined pursuant
to the provisions of F.S. § 215.84.
(k)
(1)In the discretion of the authority, each or any issue of bonds may be secured by a trust
agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be made by a
trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The
resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or such trust agreement may pledge the
revenues to be received from any airport facilities of the authority but shall not convey or
mortgage any such facilities, and may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the
rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation
of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the
acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and
insurance of any such facilities, the fixing and revising of rates, fees, and charges, and the
custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and for the employment of consulting
engineers in connection with such acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or operation. It
shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which
may Ordinance as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such
indemnifying bonds, or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such
resolution or trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of
the trustee, if any, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. Such
resolution or trust agreement may contain such other provisions in addition to the foregoing
as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. The
authority may provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the
revenues of any airport facilities to such officer, board, or depositary as it may designate for
the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and
restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such
resolution or trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of operation.
28/246
(2) All pledges of revenues under the provisions of this section shall be valid and binding
from time to time when such pledges are made. All such revenues so pledged and
thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of such
pledges without any physical delivery thereof or further action, and the lien of such
pledges shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort,
contract, or otherwise, against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have
notice thereof.
(l) All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Ordinance shall be deemed to be
trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this section. The resolution
authorizing the issuance of bonds or the trust agreement securing such bonds shall provide
that any officer to whom, or bank, trust company, or fiscal agent to which, such moneys
shall be paid shall Ordinance as trustee of such moneys and shall hold and apply the same
for the purposes hereof, subject to such regulation as the resolution or trust agreement may
provide.
(m) Any holder of bonds issued under the provisions of this section or of any of the
coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust agreement, except to extend
the rights herein given as may be restricted by the resolution authorizing the issuance of
such bonds or such trust agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action,
mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of
the state or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust agreement, and may enforce
and compel the performance of all duties required by this section or by such resolution or
trust agreement to be performed by the authority or by any officer thereof, including the
fixing, charging, and collecting of rates, fees, and charges for the use of or for the services
and facilities furnished by any airport facilities.
(n) The authority is hereby authorized to issue from time to time refunding bonds for the
purpose of refunding any bonds of the authority then outstanding, including the payment of
any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of
redemption of such bonds. The authority is further authorized to issue from time to time
bonds of the authority for the combined purpose of refunding any bonds of the authority
then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any
interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of such bonds, and paying all or any
part of the cost of acquiring or constructing any additional facilities or of any
improvements. The issuance of such bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the
rights and remedies of the holders thereof, and the rights, powers, privileges, duties, and
obligations of the authority with respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing
provisions of this section insofar as the same may be applicable.
(o) The Lake Wales Airport Authority, as hereby created, shall have no power or authority
to bind or commit the City of Lake Wales, a Florida Municipal Corporation, in any manner
directly or indirectly and the City of Lake Wales shall not be liable or responsible in any
manner for any of the debts, liabilities, obligations, Ordinances, or omissions of the Lake
Wales Airport Authority, or any of its officers or employees. All persons dealing with the
said authority are hereby charged with full notice of this limitation of its powers.
29/246
(p) As a dependent special district, the Lake Wales Airport Authority will comply with the
applicable financial reporting requirements of F.S. ch. 189, and shall maintain acceptable
books of account reflecting all income and expenditures and said books shall be open to
reasonable public inspection. In addition, the Lake Wales Airport Authority Board shall
prepare on or before the first of each year a budget and no money shall be spent or
obligations incurred by the board or authority except in accordance with the terms of said
budget. An audit of the affairs of the Lake Wales Airport Authority shall be conducted
annually by a certified public accountant and shall, at the option of the authority or the City
of Lake Wales, be submitted to the finance director for his or her review by March of each
year. Within two (2) weeks after completion of said audit, the authority shall cause to be
published once in a newspaper published and circulated in the City of Lake Wales a notice
that the audit is available for public inspection at the Lake Wales Airport Authority's
office.
(q) The Lake Wales Airport Authority shall, with the consent of the City Commission of
Lake Wales, evidenced by resolution of said commission, exercise any powers relating to
aviation conferred upon municipalities by general law, including the provisions of F.S. ch.
332, or the Federal Aviation Administration.
(r) The Lake Wales Airport Authority shall hold regular meetings at least once every month
and at such other times as the authority shall determine to be reasonably necessary from
time to time.
(s) This section shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the
doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional
to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of or as
repealing any powers now existing under any other law, whether general, special, or local.
The issuance of bonds or refunding bonds under the provisions of this section shall comply
with the requirements of any other law applicable to the issuance of bonds.
(t) The Lake Wales Airport Authority is authorized from time to time to issue revenue
certificates of the authority to fund its operations, acquisitions, construction, or
reconstruction, or the improving, enlarging, or equipping of its functions and facilities,
under this section. Revenue certificates shall pay no more than the maximum interest
payable upon bonds issued by the state. The interest rate paid may vary provided that it does
not exceed the maximum paid by the state. Revenue certificates may pledge only the
revenues generated by one (1) or more of the authority's facilities or improvements and
shall not be an obligation of the state or the City of Lake Wales.
(u)
(1)The Lake Wales Airport Authority is authorized to budget and use the funds accruing to it
from auxiliary enterprises, gifts, and concessions for promotion and public relations,
including expenditures for hospitality of business guests, and industry recruitment (including
funds for travel, meals, and lodging at the actual expense, rather than the otherwise legally
established per diem rates).
(2) The accrual and expenditures of said funds shall be considered part of the authority's
budget and shall be answerable to the provisions as stated in subsection (p) of this
section.

and address of the complainant and the person or persons against whom complaint is made.
It shall also state the alleged facts surrounding the alleged commission of an unfair
housing practice and such other information as the board may require. The board, upon

§ 2-103. Processing complaints. [Repealed]
Effective: Tuesday, February 07, 2017
(a) Upon filing a complaint as set forth in this division, the board shall make such
investigation as seems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues and present them to the full
board. If the board shall determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation
has occurred and is susceptible of conciliation, it shall attempt to conciliate the matter by
methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal.
(b) The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties may be reduced to writing and
incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties, which agreement is for
conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law
has been violated. Consent agreements shall be signed on behalf of the board by the mayor.
(c) If the board determines that the complaint lacks reasonable grounds upon which to base
a violation of this article, the board may in its discretion recommend that the matter be
closed or order such further investigation as may be necessary.
(d) If the board, with respect to a matter which involves a contravention of this Code:
(1) Fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have, in good faith, attempted such
conciliation; or
(2) Fails to effect an informal conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement; or
(3) Determines that a complaint is not susceptible of conciliation;
34/246
the board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine the facts. The board shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The
respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the board prior to the
hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be held not
less than fifteen (15) days after service of the statement of charges and notice to the
respondent signed by two (2) members of the board. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the board in person or by duly authorized representative and may
have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the
right to cross-examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be
given under oath or by affirmation. The board shall not be bound by strict rules of evidence
prevailing in courts of law or equity. The board shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by
any principal party to the proceedings, the board shall furnish such party a copy of the
hearing record, if any, at such cost as the board deems appropriate. The board shall make a
finding of fact.
(e) The purpose and effect of the procedure before the board and of its findings is to
obtain:
(1) The resolution of differences and postures which are not consistent with the law; and
(2) Where conciliation has failed to resolve the discriminatory postures, to clarify the
issues and to assist an aggrieved person to formulate his case, if he elects to seek
remedies afforded by the law, particularly, but not limited to the United States Civil
Rights Act of 1968. However, if in the opinion of the open housing board, such action is
warranted, the matter shall be turned over to the city prosecutor or state attorney for
further investigation with a view towards filing charges against the offending party in the
appropriate court. Nothing herein shall prevent any person from exercising any right or
seeking any remedy to which he might otherwise be entitled or from filing of any
complaint with any other agency or any court having jurisdiction.

§ 2-211.01. Disciplinary actionGeneral statement.
(a) It is the hope of the city that effective supervision and employee relations will avoid
most difficulties which otherwise might necessitate employee discipline. However,
disciplinary action is necessary in some instances as a tool to correct and eliminate
unacceptable conduct or performance and in these situations to end the employment
relationship.
(b) The city recognizes the fact that each situation differs in many respects from others that
may be similar in some ways. Thus, the city retains the right to treat each incident on an
individual basis without creating a precedent for other cases which may arise in the future
as to a particular employee or groups of employees and to determine the appropriate
discipline in every matter on a case-by-case basis.

§ 2-211.04. Basis for disciplinary action.

pleasure of the employee and the city and may be terminated by either without cause.
( b) Employees should also understand they may be disciplined, up to and including
termination, for violation of any of the offenses listed in section 2-211.07 below; for
violating departmental rules; for any action or failure to act which in the opinion of the city
manager, or his designee, adversely affects the ability of the employee and/or fellow
employees to perform their responsibilities and/or adversely affects the efficient operation

78/246
(a) There are two (2) groups of sample offenses for which employees may be disciplined
up to and including termination, and the guidelines for recommended penalties for those
examples of unacceptable conduct are set forth below; however, the principles concerning
application of discipline to these sample offenses as set forth in sections 2-211.01 and 22-
211.04 above shall apply. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the city to have just
cause for any form of disciplinary action, including termination, or to limit disciplinary
action to the sample offenses enumerated below.
(b) This paragraph provides recommended but not mandatory penalties to apply to the
specific example offenses listed here; however, the penalty utilized shall be discretionary
with management in all matters of discipline and nothing herein shall require that a
particular form of discipline be utilized in any case prior to the utilization of another form

encourage employees to discuss with their supervisors matters pertaining to conditions of
employment as they affect individual employees. In addition, free discussion between
employees and supervisors will lead to better understanding of practices, policies, and
procedures, which affect employees. This will serve to identify and eliminate conditions

( 2 ) Upon application to the human resources director, an employee hired prior to
10/1/85 who has entered a deferred retired option plan (DROP) may be paid for up to
five hundred (500) hours of accrued and unused sick leave (up to one thousand (1,000)
hours × one-half (½)) prior to cessation of employment provided said accrued and
unused leave was accrued prior to the employee's entrance into the DROP and provided,
in the sole discretion of the city manager, the city's cash position will not be adversely
affected by such pay out. An employee shall be eligible for pay out of unused accrued
sick leave as specified in this paragraph only once during each year of participation in the
DROP until the payable leave balance is fully paid. The city's record of accrued and
unused leave shall be adjusted to reflect the pay out of accrued leave (i.e., a pay out for
five hundred (500) hours shall result in a reduction of one thousand (1,000) hours from
the employee's accrued sick leave balance).
(3) Upon application to the human resources director, an employee hired after 10/1/85
who has entered a deferred retired option plan (DROP) may be paid for up to two
hundred (200) hours of accrued and unused sick leave (up to four hundred (400) hours ×
one-half (½)) prior to cessation of employment provided said accrued and unused leave
was accrued prior to the employee's entrance into the DROP and provided, in the sole
discretion of the city manager, the city's cash position will not be adversely affected by
such payout. An employee shall be eligible for payout of unused accrued sick leave as
specified in this paragraph once during each year of participation in the DROP until the
maximum payable leave balance is fully paid. The city's record of accrued and unused
leave shall be adjusted to reflect the pay out (i.e., a pay out for two hundred (200) hours
shall result in a reduction of four hundred (400) hours from the employee's accrued sick
leave balance). An employee who has received the maximum allowable pay out while
participating in the DROP shall not be eligible for additional pay out upon cessation of
employment.

the employee may be allowed time off without pay but only if the department head
determines the absence will not affect operations. If approved, the employee may charge it
against accumulated but unused vacation pay in full one (1) hour increments.

leave bank committee may require a second opinion from a physician if necessary to
determine whether or not surgery is elective and such second opinion will be obtained at
the employee's expense.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.01. Family medical leave eligibility.
(a) Employees who have worked for the city for at least twelve (12) months and have

(3) In order to care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent who has a serious
health condition;
( 4 ) A serious health condition which renders the employee unable to perform the
functions of the employee's position.

A "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental
condition that involves either: (1) in-patient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital,
hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity (for
purposes of this policy defined to mean the inability to work, attend school, or perform

subsequent treatment in connection with in-patient care); or (2) continuing treatment by a
health care provider.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.03. Intermittent leave.
In the case of unpaid leave for a serious health condition, the leave may be taken
intermittently or on a reduced hours basis only if such leave is medically necessary. If
intermittent or reduced hours leave is required, the city may in its sole discretion
temporarily transfer the employee to another job with equivalent pay and benefits that
better accommodates that type of leave.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.04. Verification.
(a) The city will require that an employee's leave to care for the employee's seriously ill
spouse, son, daughter, or parent, or due to the employee's own serious health condition
that makes the employee unable to perform one (1) or more of the essential functions of
employee's position, be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of
the employee or the employee's ill family member.
(b) In accordance with the DOL rules, the city may request, at the city's expense, a second
or third health care provider's opinion for leave taken because of a serious health
condition. The city may also require subsequent recertification from the employee's health
care provider on a reasonable basis, in accordance with DOL rules, which normally will
not be more than every thirty (30) days. No second or third opinion will be required upon
recertification.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)

(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.07. Health insurance premiums.
(a) During family leaves of absence, the city will continue to pay its portion of the health
insurance premiums and maintain the employee's coverage under the health plan in the
same manner as if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave
period; provided the employee continues to pay his or her share of the premiums.
(b) Should the employee fail to continue to pay his or her share of the premium, notices of
proposed insurance cancellation and the opportunity to pay the premium as required by the
FMLA will be provided before the cancellation.
(c) Employees will be advised well in advance of any changes in premiums so they will
have ample opportunity to make arrangements to continue to pay their share of the
premiums during the FMLA leave. To avoid required reimbursement, appropriate
certification from a health care provider may be required if the employee does not return to
work because of a serious health condition.
(d) If the employee does not return to work after the expiration of the leave, the employee
will be required to reimburse the city for the city's portion of health insurance premiums
during the family leave, unless the employee does not return because of the presence of a
serious health condition which prevents the employee from performing his or her job for
circumstances beyond the control of the employee.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.08. Accrual.
(a) During leave, the FMLA does not require accrual of employment benefits, such as
vacation pay, sick days, seniority, etc. Accordingly, during FMLA leave, accrual of benefits
and seniority shall be on the same basis as for any other unpaid leave of absence. Pension
benefits will be determined in accordance with DOL rules. Employment benefits to which
an employee may be entitled on the day on which the family and medical leave of absence
begins will not be lost because of such leave, except for those paid leave days substituted
for leave taken under this policy as described above. Upon return from FMLA leave,
employees are entitled to any changes in benefit plans not dependent upon seniority or
accrual during the leave period. (See section 2-221.05.)
(b) Employees will not be disqualified from bonuses based upon attendance or safety for
which they qualified prior to leave because of the taking of FMLA leave.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.09. Relationship to paid leave.
99/246
(a) Employees may elect or may be required to substitute without limitation accrued paid
vacation or personal leave for an equivalent portion of FMLA leave.
(b) Employees may elect or may be required to substitute accrued paid sick/medical leave
for an equivalent portion of FMLA leave for a serious health condition.
(c) To the extent the city does not provide paid sick/medical leave for a condition covered
by the FMLA, neither this policy nor the FMLA entitles the employees to paid leave.
However, under paragraphs (a) and (b) above, paid leave and the FMLA leave will run
concurrently.
(d) Leave covered by workers' compensation and/or long-term disability by the city will
run concurrently with the FMLA leave when the reason for the leave is covered by the
FMLA; however, the city will not require nor will it allow the use of a paid leave under
paragraphs (a) or (b) above at the same time.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.10. Return from FMLA.
With the exception of certain key employees, employees who return to work from family
leave of absence within or on the business day following the expiration of the leave are
entitled to return to their job or an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and
other terms and conditions of employment. Designation of key employee status and
whether such status will affect the employee's right of reinstatement will be made at the
time the employee requests leave, or at the commencement of leave, whichever is earlier,
or as soon as practical thereafter if such determination cannot be made at that time.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.11. Application.
Applications by the employee for family leave must be submitted in writing at least thirty
(30) days before the leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on an
expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment for a
serious health condition of the employee or of a family member. If thirty (30) days notice
is not practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave
will be required to begin, a change in circumstances or a medical emergency, notice must
be given as soon as practical.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.12. Counting FMLA leave.
To the extent allowed by law, in the event an absence is for a reason covered by the FMLA,
the city reserves the right to count it as FMLA whether the employee has applied for it or
not. When this occurs, the employee will be promptly notified as required by law.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.13. Coordination.
100/246
Absences due to sickness or injury, whether paid or unpaid, including absences for workrelated
sickness or injury that are also covered by the FMLA will be considered as FMLA
leave.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.14. Employee obligations.
During FMLA leave, employees must periodically report on their medical status and intent
to return to work. Upon taking such leave, the employee will be advised of the reporting
requirements. When the employee gives unequivocal notice of his intent not to return to
work, the employment relationship will be terminated, and the employee's entitlement to
continue leave, maintenance of health benefits, and reemployment will cease.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-219.15. Medical evidence upon return to work.
All employees of the city whose FMLA leave was taken because of the employee's own
serious health condition must obtain and present certification from his health care provider
that he is able to resume work before being allowed to return to work.

delayed and be subject to discipline up to and including discharge as permitted by law.

§ 2-219.17. Domestic violence related leave.
The city will provide eligible employees with up to three (3) working days of unpaid leave
in a 12-month period for domestic violence-related reasons.
In calculating the 12-month period under this policy, the city uses a "rolling, backwardlooking"
method. Under this method, a rolling 12-month period is measured backward
from the date the employee uses any leave under this policy, such that each time an
employee takes leave under this policy the remaining leave entitlement would be any
balance of the three (3) days' of leave which has not been used during the immediately
preceding twelve (12) months.
(a) Eligibility. To be eligible for leave under this policy, the employee must be employed
by the city for at least three (3) months.
(b) Circumstances where domestic violence-related leave is available. Leave may be
taken under the terms of this policy if the employee or a family or household member of
the employee is a victim of domestic violence and the leave is necessary to:
(1) Seek an injunction for protection against domestic violence or an injunction for
protection in cases of repeat violence, dating violence or sexual violence;
101/246
(2) Obtain medical care or mental health counseling, or both, for the employee or a
family or household member to address physical or psychological injuries resulting
from the act of domestic violence;
(3) Obtain services from a victim-services organization including, but not limited to, a
domestic violence shelter or program or a rape crisis center as a result of the act of
domestic violence;
(4) Make the employee's home secure from the perpetrator of the domestic violence or
to seek new housing to escape the perpetrator; or
(5) Seek legal assistance in addressing issues arising from the act of domestic violence
or to attend and prepare for court related proceedings arising from the act of domestic
violence.
(c) Exhaustion of paid leave required. Prior to receiving leave under this policy, the
employee must exhaust any available paid leave.
(d) Notice and supporting documentation required. Except in cases of imminent danger
to the health or safety of the employee or a family or household member, advance notice
of the need for leave is required. Where advance notice is required, the employee is
required to provide notice to the city as soon as the need for leave becomes known.
Where advance notice is not required due to the imminent danger to the health or safety
of the employee or a family or household member, the employee must inform the city
that the leave was taken pursuant to this policy as soon as he or she returns to work.
Documentation supporting the need for the leave under this policy must be submitted
with the request for leave. In cases of imminent danger to the safety of the employee or
a family or household member, supporting documentation must be submitted as soon
as the employee returns to work.
(e) Confidentiality and prohibition of retaliation.
(1) All information relating to leave under this policy shall be considered confidential
and will not be disclosed to any other individuals unless required for legitimate
business or otherwise compelled by law.
(2) Leave taken or requested under this policy will not result in any adverse action
against the employee. Employees who believe they have been subjected to retaliation as
a result of leave taken or requested under this policy must initiate a complaint in the
same manner as required by the city's harassment and discrimination complaint
procedure.
(Ord. No. 2007-34, § 1, ?-?-07)
§ 2-219.18. Military related leave.

exigencies arising out of a covered family member's active military duty, i.e. spouse, son,
daughter, or parent, and
102/246
( b) New leave entitlement. An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter,
parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is recovering from a serious
illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entitled to up to twenty-six
(26) weeks of leave in a single twelve-month period to care for the servicemember. This
provision became effective immediately upon enactment. This military caregiver leave is
available during" a single twelve-month period" during which an eligible employee, is
entitled to a combined total of twenty-six (26) weeks of all types of FMLA leave.
(c) Exhaustion of paid leave required. Prior to receiving leave under this policy, the
employee must exhaust any available paid leave.

§ 2-229.01. Drug-free workplace and alcohol policy.
The city's drug-free workplace policy is aimed at ensuring "zero" tolerance to illegal drugs
at all times and its alcohol-free policy to "zero" tolerance under circumstances that affect
or might affect the safety and well being of employees, citizens and others, or the effective
operation of city business. This policy is consistent with all Florida State and federal laws
including Florida Drug-Free Workplace Statutes [F.S. §§] 440.101 and 440.102, Drug-
Free Workplace Program Requirements, the Agency for Health Care Administration
(AHCA), Chapter 59A-24, Florida Administrative Code, Drug-Free Workplace Standards,
and the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act. In addition, all employees required to have a
commercial driver's license (CDL) under Chapter 49 CFP, part 383, are subject to
controlled substance and alcohol testing rules established by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of
1991 (revised February 1994), in accordance with 49 CFR, Parts 40, 383, 392, 4, and
392.5. Regulatory penalties for infractions are in addition to disciplinary action including
termination of employment.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-229.02. Policy.
( a ) Illegal controlled substances. The city prohibits the use, distribution, possession,
manufacture, cultivation, sale or attempt to sell or distribute illegal controlled substances
at any time whether on or off duty, whether on or off city property. Illegal controlled
substances are defined by applicable state and federal laws.
(b) Alcohol abuse. Employees of the city are prohibited from using or possessing alcohol
while on duty; while on city premises; while driving a city vehicle, operating a piece of the
city's equipment, or being transported in city vehicles at any time; reporting to work under
the influence of alcohol; or, from otherwise using alcohol in a manner at any time which
adversely affects the business interests of the city.
116/246
Note: A sworn employee of the city police department, or an employee acting under the
direction of such, may have cause in the course of conducting city business, to acquire
and/or manipulate some form of alcohol or drugs for a duty purpose, and not for other
non-job related reasons, and such shall be done in accordance with the officer's
assigned duties and in accordance with police department policies.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-229.03. Use of legal drugs.
The use of legal drugs, that are prescribed by licensed physicians for a specific medical
purpose is not prohibited. However, such drugs can and often do have a direct impact on
the vigilance, judgment and/or coordination of the employee and may adversely affect the
employee's job performance and the employee's ability to work in a safe and efficient
manner. This is particularly true in safety-sensitive assignments involving the operation of
motor vehicles and other moving equipment. Therefore, an employee for whom a licensed
physician or dentist prescribes a controlled substance must advise the supervisor
immediately in order that an evaluation can be made on the impact, if any, on the safe and
efficient operation of the city. Detection of a controlled substance will be presumed to be
in violation of this policy unless the employee advises the supervisor of its medicinal use
in advance. The supervisor must immediately advise the department head of such use by the
employee.
(Ord. No. 2001-08, § 1, 6-19-01)
§ 2-229.04. Substances tested for.

work-related accident, or in any unsafe and/or negligent maintenance or operation of the
city's equipment or vehicles at any time where in the opinion of the city manager the
employee was at fault or the employee's conduct contributed to the accident.
(3) When reasonable suspicion exists to believe the employee is using drugs or alcohol
in violation of this policy. A reasonable suspicion is a belief that an employee is using or
has used drugs or alcohol in violation of this policy drawn from specific objective and
articulatable facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of
experience. Among other things, such facts and inferences may be based upon:

(4) Unless prohibited by law, as a part of any medical examination required by the city
whether or not that medical examination is required by the DOT or any other local, state
or federal law or regulation.
(5) Unless prohibited by applicable law, the city reserves the right to test any employee
for illegal drugs and alcohol to determine compliance with this policy at any time with or
without prior announcement on a random or other basis.
(6) For the purpose of this policy, if a test reveals the presence of alcohol, the employee
shall be deemed to have violated the city policy.
(7) Employees and job applicants have the right to consult with the testing laboratory for
technical information regarding prescription and non-prescription medications. The
name, address and telephone number of the testing laboratory will be provided to the
employee or job applicant upon request.

terminated.
(c) Without regard to prosecution or conviction by appropriate governmental entities, the
city may, at its option, conduct its own independent investigation to determine whether or

the city, it believes a violation has occurred, it will take whatever disciplinary action it
deems appropriate regardless of the ultimate outcome of any criminal case that may be
brought against the employee.

employee in violation of this policy, whether he voluntarily reports his problem or not, to
participate in the EAP or other medical and rehabilitative assistance programs as a
condition for continued employment. For further information regarding the EAP, contact
human resources.
(1) Employees who voluntarily ask for help. Employees with drug or alcohol related
problems who wish assistance through the EAP may contact the EAP. If the employee
has a satisfactory performance record, the city may grant the employee an unpaid leave of
absence for a period determined by the city to participate in a city-approved treatment or
rehabilitative program. This employee will be responsible for all expenses resulting from
the treatment or program to the extent they are not covered by insurance.
(2) Other employees. In the event the city discovers a violation of this drug or alcohol

manager to evaluate the continuation of the city's payment of the thirty-three and onethird
(331/3) percent supplement. This supplement may be continued with the city
manager's approval for thirty (30) day periods and is subject to review by the city
manager at the end of each thirty (30) day period until the employee returns to work or is
qualified for disability retirement. If there is a conflict between the city manager's review
and the recommendation of the treating physician, the city manager reserves the right to
require additional medical evaluation by a city-designated physician. The supplemental
payment will continue during said review. If the city manager decides to discontinue the
city's payment of the thirty-three and one-third (331/3) percent supplement after the
initial thirty (30) days of disability, the employee may elect to receive a thirty-three and
one-third (331/3) percent supplemental payment and have it charged against vacation or
sick leave.

employee is unable to perform full, normal duties but is qualified for "light duty" which
does not hinder treatment or recuperation, the employee may be placed on "light duty" at
the city's option. Work performed on "light duty" will be paid at the employee's normal
hourly rate and payment for such work will be deducted from any supplemental pay
which might have been granted to the employee.

(Ord. No. 2019-06, § 1, 4-3-19)
§ 2-230.14. Policy
Effective: Wednesday, April 03, 2019

(j) The City reserves the right to restrict or remove any content that is deemed in

(Ord. No. 2019-06, § 1, 4-3-19)
§ 2-230.15. Guidelines for Use of Social Media Sites
Effective: Wednesday, April 03, 2019
(a) Electronic Communications and Computer Usage Policy. All employees are responsible for
understanding and following the City's Electronic Communications and Computer Usage Policy,
in addition to this Policy.
132/246
(b) First Amendment Protected Speech. Although the City can moderate the social media sites
that accept comments from the public (such as blogs and wikis) to restrict speech that is
obscene, threatening, discriminatory, harassing, or off topic, employees cannot use the
moderation function to restrict speech with which the City merely disagrees (i.e. subject matter
restrictions). Users have some First Amendment rights in posting content to public social media
sites hosted by municipalities. Moderators must respect those rights by posting all comments
other than those excluded for specific legitimate reasons, as referenced above.
(c) Copyright Law. Employees must abide by laws governing copyright and fair use of
copyrighted material owned by others. Never reprint whole articles or publications without first
receiving written permission from the publication owner. Never quote an excerpt of someone
elses work without acknowledging the source, and, if possible, provide a link to the original.
(d) Conflict of Interest. Employees are prohibited from using social media to engage in any
activity that constitutes a conflict of interest for the City or any of its employees.
(e) Protect Confidential Information. Never post legally protected personal information that you
have obtained from the City (e.g., information that is not public record under the Public Records
Law or whose dissemination is restricted under applicable Federal or State privacy laws or
regulations). Ask permission to publish or report on conversations that occur within the City.
Never post information about policies or plans that have not been finalized by the City, unless you
have received explicit permission from your supervisor to post draft policies or plans on the
departments social media sites for public comment.
(f) Consider Your Content. As informal as social media sites are meant to be, if they are on a
government domain or a government identity, they are official government communications.
Social media sites will be sought out by mainstream media  so a great deal of thought needs to
go into how you will use the social media in a way that benefits both the City and the public.
Employees should not comment about rumors, political disputes, or personnel issues, for
example.
(g) Handling Negative Comments. Because the purpose of many social media sites, particularly
department blogs and wikis, is to get feedback from the public, you should expect that some of
the feedback you receive will be negative. Some effective ways to respond to negative comments
include:
1) Providing accurate information in the spirit of being helpful;
2) Respectfully disagreeing; and
3) Acknowledging that it is possible to hold different points of view.
(h) Respect Your Audience and Your Coworkers. Do not use ethnic slurs, personal insults,
obscenity, or engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in your departments
workplace. Do not be afraid to be yourself, but do so respectfully. This includes not only the
obvious (no ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, threats of violence, etc.) but also proper
consideration of privacy and of topics that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory
such as party politics and religion. Do not use your departments social media presence to
communicate among fellow City employees. Do not air your differences with your fellow City
employees on your departments social medias sites.
(I) Use the Social Media Site or Identity Only to Contribute to your Departments Mission.
When you contribute to your departments social media site or identity, provide worthwhile
information and perspective that contribute to your departments mission of serving the public.
What you publish will reflect on the City. Social media sites and identities should be used in a way
that contributes to the Citys mission by:
133/246
1) Helping you and your co-workers perform their jobs better;
2) Informing citizens about government services and how to access them;
3) Making the operations of your department transparent and accessible to the public;
4) Creating a forum for the receipt of candid comments from residents about how government
can be improved; and
5) Encouraging civic engagement.
(j) Mistakes. The City policy is that once something is posted, it should stay posted. Only
spelling errors or grammar fixes should be made without making the change evident to users. If
you choose to modify an earlier post, make it clear that you have done sodo not remove or
delete the incorrect content; provide the correct information and apologize for the error. Ways to
accomplish this include:
1) Strike through the error and correct; or
2) Create a new post with the correct information, and link to it from the post you need to
correct or clarify.
Either method is acceptable. In order for the social media identity or site to achieve transparency,
the City cannot change content that has already been published without making the changes
clearly evident to users.
(k) Media Inquiries. City or department social media identities or sites may lead to increased
inquiries from the media. If you are contacted directly by a reporter, you should refer media
questions to the Public Information Officer.
(l) Personal Comments. Make it clear when you are speaking for yourself as a resident or
stakeholder, and not on behalf of the City of Lake Wales. If you publish content on any website
of the City and it has something to do with the work you do or subjects associated with the City,
use a disclaimer such as this: The postings on this site are my own and dont necessarily
represent the Citys positions or opinions.
(m) Employee Profile. If you identify yourself as a City employee ensure your profile and related
content is consistent with how you wish to present yourself to colleagues, residents and other
stakeholders.
(n) Defamation. Be aware that employees acting in their individual capacity (not on behalf of the
City) are not immune from defamation claims. Under the law, defamation is established by
showing that the defendant published a false, non-privileged statement about the plaintiff to a third
party that either caused the plaintiff economic loss or was of the type that is actionable without
proof of economic loss. Avoid statements that may be interpreted as defamatory.
(o) Records Retention. Social media sites will contain communications sent to or received by
employees, and are therefore Public Records. Ensure that the City or department retains a copy
of the social media content in accordance with Public Records Retention Schedules. Review the
third party social media service providers terms of service for its record retention practices. Note
that while third party social media providers will most likely save your content for some period of
time, they generally will not save it indefinitely. To the extent their policies are inconsistent with
Public Records Retention Schedules, the City or department should retain copies of social media
posts such as by printing or otherwise storing periodic snapshots of the social media sites.
134/246
(p) Open Meeting Law. Be aware of the Open Meeting Law and possible violations for improper
deliberations outside of a posted meeting. A series of individual postings on a social media site
cumulatively may convey the position of a quorum of a governmental body regarding a subject
within its jurisdiction, and may constitute improper deliberation among the members of a board or
committee.
(Ord. No. 2019-06, § 1, 4-3-19)
§ 2-230.16. Take home vehicles
Effective: Wednesday, April 03, 2019

(1) the shelves, racks, or other permanent interior construction which has been installed to carry and
store such heavy items is such that it is unlikely that the truck will be used more than a very minimal
amount for personal purposes; and,
(2) the employer requires the employee to drive the truck home in order to be able to respond in
emergency situations for purposes of restoring or maintaining water or sewer utility purposes.
(3) Other exceptions as set forth in IRS rules/guideline.
g) Income reported will be directly based on actual round trip mileage from workplace to home at the
standard rate set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). All employees assigned a city vehicle for overnight

§ 2-234. Revision.
(a) The city manager shall make or cause to have made such comparative studies as he
determines necessary the factors affecting the level of salary ranges prior to the preparation
of the annual budget. On the basis of information derived from such studies, the city
manager shall recommend to the city commission such changes in salary ranges and
classifications as he determines necessary to maintain the fairness and adequacy of the pay
plan.
(b) Comparative studies shall evaluate salary ranges with regard to ranges of pay for other
classes, relative difficulty and responsibility of positions in the class, educational and skill
level required for positions in the class, availability of employees in particular
occupational categories, prevailing rates of pay for similar employment in the city, rates of
pay in other governmental jurisdictions, cost of living factors, the financial policies of the
city, and other economic considerations.
(Ord. No. 94-18, § 1, 9-20-94)
§ 2-235. Hourly rates.
(a) The schedule of salary ranges established in this division represent the minimum and
maximum annual salary to be paid an employee who works the standard forty (40) hour

work week for the purpose of computer record keeping and calculation of bi-weekly pay.
(b) Should the city manager determine that it is in the best interests of the city that an
employee or group of employees work less than the standard forty (40) hour week, that
employee or group of employees shall be paid at an hourly rate within the range established

salary range for the class to which his position is allocated.

to which his position is allocated shall be granted increases in the form of a lump sum
payment rather than an adjustment to base pay until such time as the employee's salary is
below the maximum for the salary range. This shall apply to cost of living increases,
longevity pay, education incentive and merit increases. Lump sum payments shall be
subject to deduction of applicable payroll taxes and retirement plan contributions.
(Ord. No. 94-18, § 1, 9-20-94)
§ 2-237. Adjustments within salary ranges.

may be considered at intervals of one (1) year and granted upon the written
recommendation of the department head and the approval of the city manager provided
sufficient funds exist within the department budget.

be granted without regard to limitations of time upon approval of the city manager
provided sufficient funds exist within the department budget.
(d) Salary reductions may be directed by the city manager after evaluation of an employee's
job performance. No salary reduction may be made below the entry level pay for an
employee's classification. A memorandum stating the reason for the reduction shall be
provided to the employee on or before the effective date of the reduction, and a copy of the
memorandum shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. An employee who receives a
salary reduction may request a re-evaluation six (6) months after the reduction. If the
request does not result in restoration of the former salary, the request may be made again
one (1) year after the salary reduction. The request shall be made to the city manager.
(Ord. No. 94-18, § 1, 9-20-94)
§ 2-238. Entry into a salary range.
(a) New employee. The minimum salary for a class shall be paid to any person upon his
original appointment to a position except when, as determined by the city manager, there
has been demonstrated inability to recruit at the minimum salary or the new employee
possesses exceptional qualifications warranting employment at a higher rate in the salary
range.
138/246
(b) Promoted employee. An employee promoted to a position within a class for which the
minimum salary is less than five (5) percent than his present salary may be granted an
increase of five (5) percent. A salary increase greater than five (5) percent may be granted
when, as determined by the city manager, the promoted employee possesses exceptional
qualifications warranting a higher rate in the salary range.
(c) Part-time or temporary employee. A part-time or temporary employee shall be paid at
the minimum rate for the class of position for which he is employed; provided, however,
that where, in the best interests of the city, it is necessary to temporarily employ extra
laborers or craftsmen, the city manager may authorize that such employees be paid at the
prevailing construction or craft rates.
(d) Transfer or job reclassification. When an employee is transferred to a position of a
different classification and the transfer is not in the nature of a promotion, his pay rate
shall be adjusted to the minimum rate established for that classification if it is higher than
his present rate of pay. If an employee's position is reclassified to a higher salary range with
no change in duties or responsibilities, his pay rate shall be adjusted to the minimum rate
established for that salary range if it is higher than his present rate of pay. If an employee's
position is reclassified to a higher salary range with an increase in duties and
responsibilities, his rate shall be adjusted to the minimum for the new salary range or he
shall receive a five (5) percent increase, whichever results in the higher rate of pay.
(Ord. No. 94-18, § 1, 9-20-94)
§ 2-239. Special situations.
(a) End of probation. When an employee completes his first six (6) months in a position
and receives a satisfactory performance evaluation, he is eligible for a salary increase of up
to five (5) percent at the discretion of the department head with the approval of the city
manager.
(b) Demotion. If an employee is demoted to a lower job classification, whether at his own
request or by action of the department head, he shall not be paid less than the minimum rate
nor more than the maximum rate established for the salary range of the lower job
classification.
(c) Leave of absence. When an employee returns to duty in the same position or salary
range following a leave of absence, he shall receive the same pay rate as was received prior
to taking leave. If the salary range for the job classification has been upgraded during the
employee's absence or the position has been reclassified to a higher salary range, the
returning employee's rate of pay will be adjusted accordingly. If the job qualifications of
the employee have increased during the leave of absence, consideration will be given to
reinstating the employee at a higher rate.
(d) Temporary work in higher classification. When an employee is required to work on a
temporary basis in a position with a higher classification than that of his regular position,
he will be paid the appropriate rate of the higher classification. The temporary pay rate will
be calculated as follows:
Calculate percent increase from minimum of regular salary to minimum of temporary
salary range. Multiply employee's normal hourly rate by percent increase to determine his
temporary hourly rate which may not exceed the maximum for the temporary salary
range.
139/246
A temporary assignment will receive the prior approval of the city manager and will not
exceed thirty (30) days; where circumstances required, the city manager may extend the
temporary assignment. At the conclusion of the temporary assignment, the employee's rate
of pay will revert to the authorized rate established for his regular position. Filling in or
doing the work of an employee in the same department who is on vacation or absent for
short periods of time will not be considered as a temporary assignment to a higher
classification. Serving as an "acting" supervisor or "acting" department head in the absence
of the supervisor or department head will not be considered as a temporary assignment to a
higher classification.
(Ord. No. 94-18, § 1, 9-20-94)

(5) percent increase in pay upon the completion of an Associates Degree, Bachelors Degree

§ 2-242. Implementation of pay increases.
(a) All pay increases shall be made effective on the first day of a pay period to eliminate
calculation of wages on multiple hourly rates within a single pay period; provided,

of the pay period following the employee's anniversary date.
(b) Any pay increase involving retroactive calculation will require a memorandum from
the department head and approval by the city manager to document the reason for delay of
the pay increase.

§ 2-244. Overtime.
Effective: Tuesday, May 17, 2016
(a) As a general rule, the requirement of frequent overtime services in a department shall
be considered evidence of under-staffing or improper organization and shall be subject to
review by the city manager; however, employees shall work overtime when requested
unless excused by their supervisor.
(b) Records of all overtime work shall be kept by the department head, and overtime
compensation will not be paid unless overtime work has been documented by the employee
and verified by the supervisor.
(c) Employees in non-exempt classifications required to work in excess of forty (40) hours
in a designated work week shall be paid overtime or granted compensatory time off.
Monetary payment or compensatory time off for overtime shall be calculated at the rate of
one and one-half (1½) times the regular rate for all hours worked in excess of forty (40)
hours in any designated work week.
(d) For purposes of computing overtime, "time worked" shall mean those hours during
which the employee is engaged in performing the duties of his job. With the exceptions
stated in this paragraph, overtime pay will only be paid when an employee has actually
worked more than forty (40) hours per week. Overtime shall not be computed on sick
leave, jury duty/witness duty, funeral leave, or comp time. However, vacation days,
holidays, safety days, and optional holiday shall be counted as days worked when
calculating overtime.
(e) Non-exempt employees who, for their own convenience, arrive early at their work area
or leave late will not perform work during these periods. Work during such periods is
likely to extend the employee's work week beyond forty (40) hours and will require the
prior authorization of the department head.
141/246
(f) At the request of the employee and at the discretion of the department head, non-exempt
employees may be granted compensatory time off (comp time) in lieu of monetary wage.
Comp time will accrue at the premium rate of time and one-half (1½) for each hour of
overtime worked.
(1) An employee who has accumulated comp time may request time off. Such requests
will be granted within a reasonable amount of time so long as time off does not unduly
disrupt the department's operations. Compensatory time off will require the prior
approval of the department head.
(2) No employee will be permitted to accrue more than eighty (80) hours of comp time.
If the employee has accrued the maximum comp time, all subsequent overtime worked
will be paid as monetary wage.
(3) Upon termination, comp time remaining on the books will be paid at the employee's
current rate or his average rate over the last three (3) years, whichever is higher.
(4) An employee may request monetary payment of all or a portion of accrued comp time
at his current hourly rate. Such request shall be made by memorandum to the city
manager and shall receive the approval of the city manager prior to payment. A copy of
the memorandum will be placed in the employee's personnel file.
(5) Any non-exempt employee that is, or has been, promoted or reclassified to an exempt
position shall have any accrued comp time liability immediately paid to the employee in a
single cash disbursement, at his or her final rate of pay prior to promotion from the nonexempt
position.
(g) Overtime resulting from training required by the city shall qualify for overtime
compensation. Training required for state-mandated certification shall not qualify.
Overtime compensation will not be paid when training is voluntary. Travel time to and
from work or place of training will not be considered as time worked and will not be
included in calculating overtime.
(h) An employee who works in two (2) or more different classifications during a single pay
period and performs two (2) or more different types of work for which different straighttime
rates have been established, shall receive overtime pay calculated on the weighted
average of such rates.
(i) Part-time employees shall earn time and one-half (1½) after working forty (40) hours in
a week. All hours worked in excess of a normal schedule up to forty (40) hours will be
paid at the employee's straight hourly rate. At the discretion of the department head, the
part-time employee may accrue comp time for hours worked in excess of his normal
schedule, however comp time shall be earned at the rate of one (1) hour off for each hour
worked until forty (40) hours have been worked. After working forty (40) hours in one (1)
week, the part-time employee will earn overtime pay or accrue comp time at the rate of
time and one-half (1½) for each hour worked.
(j) Employees in exempt classifications are salaried employees and are expected to work as
long as necessary to fulfill their job responsibilities. If, however circumstances arise which
require considerable extra work time, compensatory time off may be granted at the
discretion of the department head; however, such compensatory time shall not accrue as for
nonexempt employees and shall not be paid as a monetary wage.
142/246
(k) Whenever by declaration of the Mayor immediate action is necessary to preserve the public peace, property, health,
or safety within the City or to provide for continued operation of city government and exempt employees are directed by
the City Manager to undertake immediate emergency response measures, such exempt employees shall be paid
overtime wages at a rate of pay commensurate with overtime pay calculated for non-exempt employees during the
period of the emergency. If the following conditions are met, then exempt personnel will be eligible for overtime
compensation.
(1) The Mayor of the City of Lake Wales has signed a declaration declaring that a State of Emergency exists in the

(a) Holiday premium. If an employee is required to work on a designated holiday, the
employee shall be paid holiday premium pay for up to eight (8) hours worked at time and
one-half (1½) in addition to holiday pay. Comp time may be substituted for holiday
premium pay at the rate of time and one-half (1½). If an employee is absent on both the day
before and day after a holiday, he shall be ineligible for holiday premium pay or comp time.
(b) Pager premium. Employees assigned to pager duty will receive one (1) hour pay at
time and one-half (1½) for each twenty-four (24) hour period if that period of pager duty
is on a week day. Employees assigned to pager duty will receive one and one-half (½) hour
of pay at time and one-half (1½) for each twenty-four (24) hour period if that period of
pager duty is on a weekend or holiday.
(c) Call-out premium. Employees not on pager duty will receive a minimum of two (2)
hours overtime pay when called out or called back to work after regular working hours.
Supervisors will ensure that employees are called out on an emergency basis only and that
no more employees are called out than are needed to resolve the emergency.

notice in accordance with section 2-418(a)(2) and after receipt of written quotes.

the need for specialization or standardization shall be furnished to the city commission
and shall be furnished to the finance director with the voucher authorizing payment.

requirements of competitive sealed bidding. The city manager may provide written
authorization to any officer, employee or agency to enter a bid or bids, or make any
payment required in connection with such bidding, in the city's behalf for any surplus
property offered for lease, sale or other disposal by any governmental agency or private
entity if the purchase of such surplus property is deemed by the city manager to be in the
best interest of the public.
(9) Noncompetitive bid or proposal. If fewer than three (3) responsive bids or proposals
for commodity or contractual services purchases are received, the city manager may
negotiate or authorize the negotiation of the best terms and conditions.
(d) Procurement without competition. In any procurement that is accomplished without
competition, the individuals taking part in the development or selection of criteria for
evaluation, the evaluation process, and the award process shall attest in writing that they
are independent of, and have no conflict of interest in, the entities evaluated and selected.

of subsections (a) or (b).

conditions set forth in the initial contract. There shall be only one (1) extension of a

of the contract is due to events beyond the control of the contractor.
159/246
( g ) Renewal of contracts. Except for those contracts initially procured pursuant to

program areas and service requirements for which contractual services are required to aid
in the selection of contractors for contracts of more than the threshold amount provided

qualified firm; failing accord with the second most qualified firm, negotiations with that
firm shall be formally terminated. The city manager or his designee shall then undertake

§ 2-458. Additional requirements for procurement of construction
services for public property and publicly owned buildings.
In addition to all other requirements of this article pertaining to procurement of
commodities and services and in accordance with F.S. ch. 255, the following requirements
shall apply to procurement of construction services for public property and publicly owned
buildings as defined in section 2-455:
(1) Preference to home industries. In accordance with F.S. § 255.041, the city shall give
preference in the purchase of material and in letting contracts for the construction of
public buildings to materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, and laborers who
reside within the state, whenever such material can be purchased or the services of such
materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, and laborers can be employed at no greater
expense than that which would exist if such purchase was made from, or contract let or
employment given to, a person residing beyond the limits of the state. However, this
section in no way prohibits the right of the city to compare the quality of materials
proposed for purchase and to compare the qualifications, character, responsibility, and
fitness of materialmen, contractors, builders, architects, and laborers proposed for
employment in its consideration of the purchase of materials or employment of persons.
172/246
(2 ) Sole source. Notwithstanding the foregoing preference to home industries, when
letting of contracts or purchasing materials for the construction, modification, alteration
or repair of any publicly owned facility, the city may not specify the use of materials or
systems by a sole source unless:
a. The city commission, after consideration of all available alternative materials and
systems, determines that the specification of a sole material or system is justifiable
based upon its cost or interchangeability;
b. The sole source specification has been recommended by the architect or engineer of
record; and
c. The consideration by, and the justifications of, the city commission are documented,
in writing, in the project file.
(3) Separate specifications for building contracts.
a. When preparing specifications, awarding or entering into contract for the erection,
construction, or altering of publicly owned buildings where the entire cost of such
work shall exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), separate specifications may be
prepared for each of the following classes of work to be performed:
1. Heating and ventilating and accessories.
2. Plumbing and gas fitting and accessories.
3. Electrical installations.
4. Air conditioning and accessories.
b . All such specifications may be drawn so as to permit separate and independent
bidding upon each of the classes of work enumerated above. All contracts for the
erection, construction or alteration of buildings, or any part thereof, may be awarded
separately to responsible and reliable persons, firms or corporations regularly engaged
in their respective line of work; provided, however, that all or any part of the work
specified in the above classes may be awarded to the same contractor.
(4) Shelter in public buildings. F.S. § 255.042, requires that consideration be given to
providing floor area capable of sheltering one hundred (100) or more persons from
radiation hazards in the event of nuclear attack when preparing plans and specifications
for new public buildings or substantial renovations to existing buildings. Accordingly,
the architect, architect-engineer firm or other person or persons involved in the design of
such buildings or substantial renovations shall refer to F.S. § 255.042, for guidance in
preparing plans and specifications. It shall be the responsibility of the city commission to
determine whether cost, or other related factors, precludes or makes impracticable the
incorporation of fallout shelter in public buildings.
( 5 ) Specification of Florida produced lumber. In accordance with F.S. § 255.20,
contracts for public works and contracts for the construction of public bridges, buildings
and other structures shall always specify lumber, timber and other forest products
produced and manufactured in Florida whenever such products are availableprice,
fitness and quality being equal. This requirement shall not apply when plywood is
specified for monolithic concrete forms, when the structural or service requirements for
timber in a particular job cannot be supplied by native species, or when construction is
financed in whole or in part from federal funds with the requirements that there be no
restrictions as to species or place of manufacture.
173/246
(6) Special facilities for physically disabled. In accordance with F.S. § 255.21, any
building or facility intended for use by the general public which, in whole or in part, is
constructed or altered by the city shall, with respect to the altered or newly constructed
portion of such building or facility comply with standards and specifications established
by F.S. § 553.48.
(7) Construction management services. The city may enter into a contract with the state
division of building construction, to provide project management, administration
services, or assistance for the construction, renovation, repair, modification, or
demolition of city buildings, utilities, parks, parking lots, or other facilities or
improvements. The contract shall provide for payment of fees to the division.

Division 9. Cdbg Procurement And Acquisition Procedures
§ 2-486. Procurement procedures for community development block
grant program.
Effective: Tuesday, October 17, 2017
(a) CDBG procurement policy. It is the policy of the City to obtain commodities and
services efficiently and effectively in free and open competition for the community
development block grant (CDBG) program through the use of sound procurement
practices. All City staff and other persons with designated responsibility for the
administration of CDBG award contracts are responsible for ensuring compliance with all
applicable federal and state laws and regulations. These include but are not limited to: 24
CFR 85.36, OMB Circular A-102, Attachment 0, Chapter 98-43 Florida Administrative
Code and F.S. ch. 287,255.0525, 2 CFR Part 200.317-.326, Rule 73c- 23 Florida
Administrative Code as applicable.
( b) City procurement policy. The City's policy for procurement of commodities and
services shall govern the procurement of commodities and services for CDBG program
activities, except as provided herein.
180/246
The Citys Purchasing Specialist or his or her designee shall serve as the central purchasing
officer (the Purchasing Officer) of the City of Lake Wales for all contracts or
agreements described herein. The following cost categories for CDBG purchases shall be
used to determine applicable purchasing and contract award procedures:
(c) Small purchases.
(1) All procurement of commodities or services in excess of five hundred dollars
($500.00) shall require a written agreement embodying all provisions and conditions
thereof.
(2) All CDBG related procurement of commodities or services less than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) may be approved by the City Manager or his/her authorized
representative without a competitive bid process.
(3) All procurement of commodities or services in excess of five hundred dollars
($500.00) and less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) may be entered only after
informal competition based on offers or quotes from not less than three (3) vendors.
(4) Procurement shall be made by one (1) of the following methods, as described below:
a. Small purchase procedures.
b. Competitive sealed bids (formal advertising).
c. Competitive negotiation.
d. Noncompetitive negotiation.
(d) Competitive sealed bids.
(1) Purchases greater than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), including purchases up to
$100,000 and greater, shall be by competitive sealed bids, unless the City Manager or
his/her authorized representative certifies in writing that sealed bidding is not practicable
or advantageous, in which case the procurement shall be competitive negotiation in
conformance with F.S. § 287.057(3) and 24 CFR 85.36(d)(3)(i). The competitive sealed
bid procedure described herein shall also be consistent with 2CFR200.320 (b).
(2) In the competitive sealed bid method of procurement (formal advertising), sealed bids
are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded
to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and
conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest reasonable price.
(3) In order for a sealed bid procedure to be feasible, certain conditions must be present,
including, at a minimum, the following:
a. A complete, adequate and realistic specification or purchase description; and
b. Two (2) or more responsible suppliers or contractors are willing and able to
compete effectively for the business.
(4) The inability or failure to obtain more than one (1) bid shall not prohibit the local
government from approving the bid, if it is demonstrated that other prospective vendors
or contractors have been given adequate notice of the procurement and an opportunity to
participate and have declined to submit bids. Also, as part of the City's evaluation as to
whether to award a sole bid, the City shall conduct a cost analysis of the bid to determine
if the cost is reasonable. The cost analysis shall include a review of profit. In addition,
the City shall request permission from the grant agency prior to awarding a sole bid.
(5) The following procedure will be followed under the sealed bid procedure:
181/246
a. At least twelve (12) days prior to the date set for opening of bids, the invitation to
bid shall be publicly noticed in a newspaper of general circulation in the City as defined
in F.S. § 50.011, and at least one (1) newspaper of regional circulation. Special note:
the state program rule allows two (2) advertisement procedures for procurements
which require public notice. Accordingly, the City has the option of advertising for
bids in a nearby OMB designated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Winter Haven). This
advertising procedure allows award of a contract if only one (1) firm submits a bid or
proposal. The second procedure allows advertisement in a local newspaper and/or
mailed solicitations, but requires at least three (3) responsive and responsible bids or
proposals received. In the case of housing programs the City may place a public notice
for a request for qualified contractors to participate in a bid list. Such public notice
requests shall be published every six (6) months during the bid and construction phase
of a housing grant. Notification of invitations to bid each project will be sent to firms
on the approved bid list. Qualified firms may apply to be placed on the bid list at any
time.
Under Section 255.0525(2), F.S. and Rule 73-23.00521(2)(a), F.A.C., an invitation to
bid for construction projects that are projected to cost more than $200,000.00 shall be
published in at least one newspaper of general circulation in POLK County as well as a
nearby federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated metropolitan
statistical area (MSA) at least 21 days prior to the established bid opening and at least 5
days prior to any scheduled prebid conference. An invitation to bid for construction
projects that are projected to cost more than $500,000.00 shall be publicly advertised at
least once in a newspaper of general circulation in POLK County at least 30 days prior
to the established bid opening and at least 5 days prior to any scheduled prebid
conference. Additionally, Notice shall be sent to those vendors and contractors on the
Citys MBE/WBE solicitation list. Alternatively, the City may substitute the above
notice with any solicitation procedure which generates at least three responsible and
responsive bids or proposals which can be considered. However, if three responsible
and responsive bids or proposals are not received, the procurement will be invalid.
An Invitation to Bid shall be issued and shall include specifications, all contractual
terms and conditions, and the place, date, and time for opening or submittal. No later
than five working days prior to the date for receipts of bids, a vendor shall make a
written request to the City for interpretations or corrections of any ambiguity,
inconsistency, or error which the vendor may discover. All interpretations or
corrections will be issued as addenda. The City will not be responsible for oral
clarifications. No negotiations, decisions, or actions shall be initiated or executed by
the proposer as a result of any discussions with any City employee prior to the opening
of proposals. Only those communications which are in writing from the City may be
considered as a duly authorized expression on the behalf of the Commission. Also, only
communications from firms or individuals which are in writing and signed will be
recognized by the Commission as duly authorized expressions on behalf of proposers.
1. Alternate(s). Alternate bids will not be considered unless authorized by and
defined in the Special Conditions of the bid specifications.
2. Approved Equivalents. The City reserves the right to determine acceptance of
item(s) as an approved equivalent. Bids which do not comply with the stated
requirements for equivalents in the bid conditions are subject to rejection. The
procedure for acceptance of equivalents shall be included in the general conditions of
the bid.
182/246
b. The invitation for bids, including specifications and pertinent attachments, shall
clearly define the items or services needed in order for the bidders to properly respond
to the invitation, state the deadline for submission of sealed bids, state the time and
place when and where the sealed bids will be publicly opened and read aloud, and state
bid bond requirements, if any.
c. All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for
bids.
d. The criteria for selection of the vendor or contractor and awarding a firm-fixed-price
or firm-fixed-unit-price contract shall be the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming
to the invitation for bids, is the lowest reasonable price. Where specified in the bid
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation costs and life cycle costs shall be
considered in determining which bid is lowest. The award notice shall be made in
writing to the selected bidder.
e. The City reserves the right to waive any minor irregularity or technicality or to reject
any and all bids.
(e) Competitive negotiation.
(1) Professional services are often procured by competitive negotiation. In competitive
negotiation, proposals are requested from a number of sources and a request for
statements of qualifications and/or proposals is publicized. Qualifications and/or
proposals are ranked and negotiations are conducted with one (1) or more of the sources
submitting offers, and either a fixed-fee or cost reimbursable type contract is awarded, as
appropriate. Competitive negotiation may be used if conditions are not appropriate for
the use of competitive sealed bids. Special note: CDBG rules do not allow cost
reimbursement contracts to be paid for with CDBG funds, though fixed fee is allowable.
(2) The following procedure will be followed under the competitive negotiation
procedure:
a. Proposals shall be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources to permit
reasonable competition consistent with the nature and requirements of the
procurement. The request for statements of qualifications and/or proposals shall be
publicly noticed at least twelve (12) days prior to the date set for receipt of statements
of qualifications and/or proposals in a newspaper of general circulation in the City as
defined in F.S. § 50.011 and at least one (1) newspaper of regional circulation. Special
note: the state program rule allows two (2) advertisement procedures for procurements
which require public notice. Accordingly, the City has the option of advertising for
bids in a nearby OMB designated Metropolitan Statistical Area (Winter Haven). This
advertising procedure allows award of a contract if only one (1) firm submits a bid or
proposal. The second procedure allows advertisement in a local newspaper and/or
mailed solicitations, but requires at least three (3) responsive and responsible bids or
proposals received.
b. The request for statements of qualifications and/or proposals shall identify the
deadline for submission of statements of qualifications and/or proposals, minimum
qualifications. All evaluation factors, including price or cost where required and their
relative importance, and state that the City will conduct a cost or price analysis for the
proposed price, including evaluation of profit.
c. The procedure for review of statements of qualifications and/or proposals shall be as
follows:
183/246
1. Each member of a selection committee receives and reviews all proposals. The
selection committee is composed of no fewer than four (4) and no more than six (6)
members appointed by the City Manager.
2. Each reviewer is provided a ranking sheet and scores each proposal in accordance
with the published evaluation criteria.
3. Completed ranking sheets are submitted to a designated member of the selection
committee to tally prior to the City Commission meeting at which the results of the
committee's review are to be announced. Proposals are ranked by score and the
ranking is read at the City Commission meeting.
4. The City Commission authorizes the City Manager to enter negotiations with the
highest ranked proposer, specifying any conditions to be met, and authorizes the City
Manager to prepare an agreement for the services if the negotiation is mutually
acceptable.
5. If a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be reached the City Manager is to enter
negotiations with the next highest ranked proposer until a mutually acceptable
agreement is reached.
6. An award of a fixed fee or cost reimbursable contract shall be made to the
responsible offerer in writing whose proposal will be most advantageous to the City,
price,and other factors considered. Unsuccessful offerers shall be notified in writing.
7. The City will abide by the Competitive Negotiation Act, F. S. § 287.055, as
amended, when procuring the services of architects or engineers. The provisions of
these procurement procedures shall not be construed to conflict or supersede the
requirements of F.S. § 287.055, as amended, or any other applicable state or federal
law. Procurement consistent F. S. § 287.055, shall include the following procedures:
Public Announcement. It is the policy of the City to publicly announce all
requirements for professional architectural, engineering, landscape architectural, and
land surveying services and to negotiate such contracts on the basis of demonstrated
competence and qualifications at fair and reasonable prices. In the procurement of
such services, the City may require firms to submit a statement of qualifications,
performance data, and other related information for the performance of professional
services. The City shall procure professional architectural, engineering, landscape
architectural, and land surveying services consistent with the provisions of Chapter
287.017 (the Consultants Competitive Negotiation Act, which is also referred to as
CCNA), Chapter 287.055 and [2CFR200.320(d) (5)].
Scope of Project Requirements. Prior to submission of the request for proposals for
professional services as an agenda item for approval by the Commission, the
Purchasing Officer shall consult with the City Manager to review the written project
requirements, which shall include at least the following information:
(a) the general purpose of the services or study;
(b) the objectives of the study or services;
(c) estimated period of time needed for the services or the study;
(d) the estimated cost of the service or study;
(e) whether the proposed study or service would or would not duplicate any prior
or existing study or services;
184/246
(f) list of current contracts or prior services or studies which are related to the
proposed study or service;
(g) the described qualifications, listed in order of importance, of the person or firm
applicable to the scope and nature of the services requested.
8. Distribution of Project Requirements. The Purchasing Officer shall distribute the
written project requirements as approved by the City Commission to all persons on
the mailing list who have indicated an interest in being considered for the
performance of such professional services and to any additional persons as the
Purchasing Officer or using agency deems desirable. The written project
requirements shall be consistent with Chapter 287.017 (the Consultants Competitive
Negotiation Act, which is also referred to as CCNA), Chapter 287.055 and
[2CFR200.320(d) (5)]. Consistent with the CCNA, price information shall not be
requested prior to negotiation with the firm or individual that is selected to provide
the requested service. The written project requirements shall include a statement of
the relative importance of each of the requirements. The project requirements shall
be accompanied by an Invitation to such persons to submit an indication of interest in
performing the required services, and by notification of the date and time when such
indications of interest are due. This date shall not be less than fourteen calendar days
from the date of public notice when the Purchasing Officer shall published in at least
one newspaper of general circulation in the County where the project is located and
in a nearby federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) designated
metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Alternatively, the City may substitute the above
notice with any solicitation procedure which generates at least three responsible and
responsive bids or proposals which can be considered. However, if three responsible
and responsive bids or proposals are not received, the procurement will be invalid.
9. Modification Prohibition. After the publicized submission time and date,
indications of interest shall not be modified or allowed to be modified in any manner
except for correction of clerical errors or other similar minor irregularities as may
be allowed by the Selection Committee (defined in Section 4.051B) prior to making
its selection of those best qualified to be formally interviewed.
10. Reuse of Existing Plans. There shall be no public notice requirements or
utilization of the selection process as provided in this section for projects in which
the City is able to reuse existing plans from a prior project. However, public notice
of any plans which are intended to be reused at some future time shall contain a
statement which provides that the plans are subject to reuse.
11. Selection Committee Membership and Evaluation. Depending on the expected
complexity and expense of the professional services to be contracted, the City may
determine whether a three member or five member selection committee will best
serve the needs of the Commission.
12. Three Member Committee Composition. Membership of a three-member
selection committee shall be appointed by the City Commission.
13. Five Member Committee Composition. Membership of a five-member selection
committee shall be appointed by the City Commission.
185/246
14. Selection Committee Evaluation. Only written responses of statements of
qualifications, performance data, and other data received in the purchasing office by
the publicized submission time and date shall be evaluated. Only those respondents
who are determined to be best qualified based upon the evaluation of written
responses and selected for Formal interview may submit additional data. From
among those persons evidencing, by timely submission of written responses, an
interest in performing the services the Selection Committee shall:
(a) prepare an alphabetical list of those persons determined by the Selection
Committee to be qualified, interested and available; and
(b) designate no less than three persons on the alphabetical list considered by
the Selection Committee to be best qualified to perform the work required.
(c) Shortlisting. The best qualified respondents shall be based upon the Selection
Committees ability to differentiate qualifications applicable to the scope and nature
of the services to be performed. The Selection Committee shall determine
qualifications, interest, and availability by reviewing the written responses that
express an interest in performing the services. The committee may also conduct
formal interviews if desired. The determination of the best qualified respondent may
be based upon, but not limited to, the following considerations:
(1) competence, including technical educational and training, experience in the kind
of project to be undertaken, availability of adequate personnel, equipment and
facilities, the extent of repeat business of the persons, and where applicable, the
relationship of construction costs estimates by the person to actual cost on previous
projects;
(2) current work load;
(3) financial responsibilities;
(4) ability to observe and advise whether plans and specifications are being compiled
with, where applicable;
(5) record of professional accomplishments;
(6) proximity to the project involved, if applicable;
(7) record of performance; and
(8) ability to design an approach and work plan to meet the project
requirements, where applicable
(d) Interview and Commission Approval. If formal interviews are conducted, the
Selection Committee shall list those respondents interviewed in order of preference
based upon the considerations listed in subsection (4) above. The respondents so listed
shall be considered to be the most qualified and shall be listed in order of preference
starting at the top of the list. The list of best qualified persons shall be forwarded to the
Commission for approval prior to beginning contract negotiations. Negotiation
sequence shall be based on the order of preference.
(1) Negotiation Staff. Contract negotiations shall be conducted by the Purchasing
Officer unless the Commission President directs that negotiations be conducted by a
Negotiation Committee.
186/246
(2) Negotiation. The Purchasing Officer or the Negotiation Committee shall
negotiate a contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified to provide the
services at compensation and upon terms which the Purchasing Officer or the
Negotiation Committee determines to be fair and reasonable to the City. In making
this decision, the Purchasing Officer or the Negotiation Committee shall take into
account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity, and the professional nature of
the services to be rendered. As a part of the negotiation, the Purchasing Officer or
the Negotiation Committee shall conduct a cost analysis, including evaluation of
profit, based on a cost breakout by the firm of its proposed price. Should the
Purchasing Officer or the Negotiations Committee be unable to negotiate a
satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be the most qualified, negotiations
with that firm will be formally terminated. The Purchasing Officer or the
Negotiation Committee shall then undertake negotiations with the second most
qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm, the Purchasing
Officer or the Negotiation Committee shall formally terminate negotiations, and then
shall undertake negotiations with the third most qualified firm. Should the
Purchasing Officer or the Negotiation Committee be unable to negotiate a
satisfactory contract with any of the selected firms, the Selection Committee shall
select additional firms in order of their competence and qualifications, and the
Purchasing Officer or Negotiation Committee shall continue negotiations in
accordance with this section until an agreement is reached or until a determination
has been made not to contract for services.
(f) Noncompetitive negotiations.
(1) Nothing herein shall limit the City to except from the requirement of competition
commodities and services available only from a single source or procurement from
another unit of government.
(2) Noncompetitive negotiation may be used when the award of a contract is not feasible
under small purchase, competitive sealed bid, or competitive negotiation procedures.
(3) Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive
negotiation are limited to the following:
a. The item is available only from a single source.
b. Public exigency or emergency when the urgency for the requirement will not permit
a delay incident to competitive solicitation. Special note:Consistent with
2CFR200.320(f),This type of procedure requires prior approval from the state agency
that administers the CDBG grant if the cost will be twenty -five thousand dollars
($25,000) or greater. Approval is very rarely given.
c. After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
d. The contract item is available under a State of Florida negotiated blanket contract.
e. The goods and/or services are procured from another unit of government.
187/246
(4) For procurements exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) the City
shall obtain written permission from the state department of economic opportunity prior
to entering into any contract procured as a result of inadequate competition, a sole
source or a non-competitive procurement negotiation based upon whether the criteria in
24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) have been satisfied. For contracts below twenty -five thousand
dollars ($25,000.00) the City shall document the justification for procurement with
inadequate competition from a sole source or based on noncompetitive negotiation
pursuant to 24 CFR 85.36.
(5) The procurement for all professional services and any contract resulting from a noncompetitive
procurement process must meet the requirements of 2 CFR 200.317-.326
and Section 287.055 of the Florida Statutes. The Citys Purchasing Officer must
conduct a cost or price analysis of all proposed prices on sole source purchases, analysis
shall include a review of profit as a separate element. Sole source purchases must be
approved by DEO in writing
(g) Bid protest.
(1) Any actual or prospective bidder, offerer, or contractor who is aggrieved in
connection with the solicitation or award of contract may protest to the City
Commission. Protestors shall seek resolution of their complaints initially with the City
Manager prior to protesting to the City Commission.
(2) Protests must be in writing and received within ten (10) days of the bid opening by
the City Manager. The written protest shall identify the protestant and the solicitation
involved; include a plain, clear statement of the grounds on which the protest is based;
and refer to the statutes, laws, ordinances, or other legal authorities which the protestant
deems himself entitled by application of such authorities to such grounds.
(3) The City Manager will meet with the protestant to review the matter and shall render
a written settlement decision within twenty-one (21) days of the written protest. If the
settlement decision is unacceptable to the protestant, the protestant may then make the
protest directly to the City Commission.
(4) In no case will the protesting bidder or offerer be entitled to any costs incurred with
the solicitation, including bid preparation costs and attorney's fees.
(5) In the event of a timely protest under this section, the City Manager shall not
proceed further with the solicitation or award of the contract until all administrative
remedies have been exhausted or until the City Manager makes a written determination
that the award of a contract without delay is necessary to protect the substantial interest
of the City.
(6) Awards in Violation of Law
188/246
a. Prior to Bid Opening or Closing Date for Receipt of Proposals. If prior to the bid
opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals, the Purchasing Officer after

federal, state, or local law or ordinance, then the solicitation shall be canceled or
revised to comply with applicable law.
b. Prior to Award. If after bid opening or the closing date for receipt of proposals,
but prior to the award contract, the Purchasing Officer after consultation with the
City Attorney, determines that a solicitation or a proposed award of a contract is in

proposed award shall be canceled.
c. After Award. If, after award, the Purchasing Officer after consultation with the
City Attorney, determine that a solicitation or award of a contract was in violation of
applicable law or ordinance, then;
(1) If the person awarded the contract has not acted fraudulently or in bad faith:
(a) the contract may be terminated and the person awarded the contract shall
be compensated for actual costs reasonably incurred under the contract plus
a reasonable profit, but excluding attorneys fees, prior to termination; or
(b) If the person awarded the contract has acted fraudulently or in bad faith the
contract may be declared null and void or voidable, if such action is in the best
interest of the City.
(h) Documentation.
(1) The City will retain records to demonstrate the rationale for choosing the method of
procurement, contractor qualifications, contract specifications, or scope of work, the
basis for selection or rejection of the contractor and the basis for the contract price.
(2) Purchases other than small purchases must be approved by the governing body and
such authorization must be reflected in the minutes.
(i) Affirmative action. The City is committed to elimination of discrimination based on
race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or physical handicap.
(j) Travel expenses. All travel payments shall conform to the allowances provided in F.S.

will not be held to apply if the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value (less
than twenty-five dollars ($25.00)).
(3) All public employees, officers, or agents of the local government are further bound
by more stringent standards of ethical conduct than those set forth in the provisions of
F.S. §§ 112.311112.326, the statutory code of ethics covering all public employees,
including elected officials.

4. The evaluation of the proposals should be separate for each service.
b. A separate professional services contract shall be procured and executed between the
City and the consultant for each particular community development block grant. Each
advertisement for procurement of community development block grant professional
services, except for grant application preparation, must specify the scope of work,
program category and community development block grant cycle by federal fiscal year
or state department of community affairs award number.
c. Those types of services having a relatively undefined scope, such as program
management or administration, and those services of a more defined scope, such as
engineering or architectural design, must be separated from each other into individual
contracts.
d. Each services contract must identify by award agreement number and individual
project the grant to which it is applicable.
e. 24 CFR 85 establishes that a general conflict may exist where a local government
awards a multi-service contract to a firm to administer its community development
block grant program, while at the same time the same firm is to provide a service, such
as engineering, where the administrator must oversee and approve its own work. In
such cases where the administrator oversees its own engineering services, the services
of an independent third party shall be obtained to provide the necessary oversight and
approvals.
f. If a community development block grant and other sources of funding are being
jointly used to fund activities under a single contract (excluding housing construction
or housing rehabilitation contracts), the activities to be paid for with community
development block grant funds must be shown as a separate line item or alternative
(deducted or added) in the procurement documents.
(m) Authority. Where there is a conflict between the various statutes, regulations or
codes, statutes shall govern over regulations, regulations over codes, and federal laws
over state laws.
( n ) Applicability. The policies and procedures contained in this section shall be
applicable to all procurement of commodities and services involving CDBG funds.
(o) Process for seeking out bids or proposals for minority business enterprises or
women-owned business enterprises. The City shall encourage the utilization of
minority business enterprises or women-owned business enterprises in a manner that is
consistent with 2CFR200.321 and by complying with the provisions of its affirmative
action policy adopted by Resolution 2002-18 on November 5, 2002,as amended,which
is incorporated herein by reference.
(m) Use of Brand Name or Equivalent Specifications
(1) Brand name or equivalent specifications may be used when the City determines that:
a. no other design, performance, or qualified product list is available;
b. time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description,
not including a brand name specification;
191/246
c. the nature of the product or the nature of the City requirements makes use of a
brand name equivalent specifications suitable for the procurement; or
d. use of brand name or equivalent specification is in the Citys best interest.
(2) Designation of Several Brand Names. Brand names or equivalent specifications
shall seek to designate three, or as many different brands as are practicable, as or
equivalent references and shall further state the substantially equivalent products to
those designated may be considered for award.
(3) Required Characteristics. The brand name or equivalent specifications shall include
a description of the particular design, functional, or performance characteristics
required.
(4) Nonrestrictive Use of Brand Name or Equivalent Specifications. Where a brand
name or equivalent specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain
explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the
standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit
or restrict competition.
(5) Determination of Equivalents. Any prospective bidder may apply, in writing, for a
pre-bid determination of equivalence by the Purchasing Officer. If sufficient
information is provided by the prospective bidder, the Purchasing Officer may
determine, in writing and prior to the bid opening time, that the proposed product would
be equivalent to the brand name used in the solicitation.
(6) Specifications of Equivalents Required for Bid Submittal. Vendors proposing
equivalent products must include in their bid submittal the manufacturers
specifications for those products. Brand names and model numbers are used for
identification and reference purposes only.
(7) Use of Brand Name Specifications. Since the use of a brand name specification is
restrictive of product competition, it may be used only when the Purchasing Officer
makes a determination that only the identified brand name item will satisfy the City
needs.
(n) City Procurement Records. All determinations and other written records pertaining to the
solicitation, award, or performance of a contract shall be maintained for the City in a
contract file. All procurement records shall be retained and disposed of by the City in
accordance with records retention guidelines and schedules established by the State of
Florida and Federal Guidelines. For CDBG related activities that retention period is six
years.
(o) Federal Policy Notice:
(1) Patents
If a contract involving research and development, experimental, or demonstration work is
being funded in whole or in part by assistance from a federal agency, then the contract shall
include the following provisions:
a. Notice to Contractor. The contract shall give notice to the contractor of the
applicable grantor agency requirements and regulations concerning reporting of, and
rights to, any discovery or inventions arising out of the contract.

provisions giving the contractor notice of these requirements. Where applicable, the
Purchasing Officer shall include in the contract provisions the requirement that the
contractor give similar notice to all of its subcontractors.
c. Consistent with the Contract Provisions of 2CFR200.326 and Appendix II of Part
200, federally funded contracts initiated by the City shall address the following:
(1) Contracts in excess of $150,000 must address administrative, contractual, or
legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and

1, 12-20-11; Ord. No. 2013-17, § 1, 11-5-13; Ord. No. 2017-18, § 1, 10-17-17)
§ 2-487. Acquisition procedures for community development block grant
program.
(a) Voluntary acquisition.
(1) A voluntary acquisition occurs when real property is acquired from an owner who
has submitted a proposal to the recipient for purchase of their property in response to a
public invitation or solicitation of offers. The local governing body is committed to this
mode of acquisition to the maximum practicable extent.
193/246
(2) Voluntary acquisition shall be permitted only if the property being acquired is not site
specific and at least two (2) properties in the community meet the criteria established by
the local government for usage, location and/or interest to be acquired. All voluntary
acquisitions must be approved in principle by the elected governing body prior to
publication of a public notice or attendance of any local government representative at a
property auction.
(3) A public notice must be published inviting offers from property owners. This notice
must:
a. Accurately describe the type, size and approximate location of the property it wishes
to acquire;
b. Describe the purpose of the purchase;
c. Specify all terms and conditions of sale, including maximum price;
d . Indicate whether or not an owner-occupant must waive relocation benefits as a
condition of sale;
e. Announce a time and place for offers to be accepted; and
f. Announce that local powers of condemnation shall not be invoked to acquire any
property offered for which a mutually agreed to sale price cannot be reached.
(4) Property may also be acquired at auction. The Uniform Relocation Act does not
apply to voluntary acquisitions.
(5) In each voluntary acquisition, a public solicitation shall occur. Offers shall be sealed
and opened at the same time, in the same place, by a responsible official. Records of
offers shall be kept. Appraisals are not required for purchases less than two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) if a mutually agreed to sales price can be reached. Clear title
must be present in every transaction. The local governing body must decide at the time of
approving the acquisition whether or not appraisals and review appraisals will be
necessary and what the maximum permissible sales price will be. The decision to acquire
will rest with the governing body which can reject or accept any and all offers. Written
records shall be maintained documenting decisions and rationale for selected coursed of
action.
(b) Non-voluntary acquisition.
(1) Acquisition of property (including easements and right-of-way) using federal funds
shall occur in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Act of 1970 (as amended) and
with any state and federal regulations which may apply.
( 2 ) Fundamental steps which will occur in each purchase may vary case by case.
However, in general terms, the following should take place: (1) source of funds and
authority to acquire confirmed; (2) property/site identified and suitable; (3) legal
description/survey/preliminary title search performed (services procured as necessary);
(4) notice of intent to acquire sent owner; (5) appraisal and review appraisal services
solicited and appraiser retained; (6) appraisal received and sent for review; (7) title
companies solicited and retained after review received (title insurance amount and
necessity determined in advance); (8) offer to purchase and notice of just compensation
sent owner; (9) owner contacted by attorney or other representative and contract
formalized; (10) settlement costs calculated and closing date set; (11) closing conducted
with funds changing hands; and (12) records of proceedings retained.
194/246
(3) The Uniform Relocation Act requires certain specific procedures such as some letters
sent being sent certified. The CDBG Implementation Manual provides a checklist which
may be utilized in following each transaction to successful conclusion.
(c) Timing and planning.
(1) Properties necessary for easements or acquisition shall be identified as early in the
planning stage as is practicable. Every attempt shall be made to effect a design which is
not wholly site dependent, that is, where two (2) or more sites are suitable for the
project. It is recognized this may not always be possible, however, a policy of minimizing
single site alternatives is emphasized.
(2) The voluntary acquisition process shall be utilized to identify possible sites early in
the project. Sites shall be evaluated for suitability prior to the final design phase to the
maximum practicable extent. As soon as alternative sites are identified and evaluated,
applicable acquisition procedures should commence.
(3) Projects shall not normally be sent out for bids unless properties to be acquired or
utilized for easements have been formally acquired or a commitment exits which is
sufficiently firm and binding to be considered safe for the project to proceed with
startup. The elected body shall make the determination as to whether or not bidding,
award and start up may proceed prior to closing on the property.
(4) In those cases where need for easements and/or acquisition is not identified until after
the project is underway, procedures shall be expedited to the maximum practicable extent
and utilization of funds, the value of which would be unrecoverable if the transaction did
not occur, minimized.
(d) Applicability. The policies and procedures contained in this section shall be applicable
to all acquisitions of property involving CDBG funds.

from safekeeping except by the city manager or his designee.
(b) The strongest assurance and control that the securities have been properly segregated on
behalf of the city is provided by an independent third-party custodian. In addition, it may be
appropriate to accept confirmation from the trust company affiliated with the other party of
the transaction. Assurances shall be obtained that the structure of this affiliation is such
that the two (2) entities are fully independent of each other, that controls are adequate and
that the city's security interest in the assets is not lost.

§ 2-513. Bid requirements.
(a) When purchasing or selling securities, the city shall select the security which provides
the highest rate of return within the parameters of this policy and which meets the current
objectives and needs of the city's portfolio. Selections shall be made utilizing one (1) of
the following methods:
(1) Competitive bids, wherein the city solicits proposals from a minimum of three (3)
firms.
(2) Comparison to the current market price as indicated by one (1) of the market pricing
resources available to the city. These resources include, but are not limited to:
a. Bloomberg Information Delivery System.
b . Wall Street Journal, or a comparable nationally recognized financial publication
providing daily market pricing.
c . Daily market pricing provided by the city's custody agent or their correspondent
institution.
(b) In most situations, the city shall utilize the competitive bid process to select the
securities to be purchased or sold. Selection by comparison to a current market price, as
indicated in paragraph (a)(2), shall be utilized when in the judgment of the city manager,
competitive bidding would inhibit the selection process. Examples of when this might
occur are:
(1) When a dealer brings to the city an unsolicited swap or proposal.
(2) When no active market exists for the issue being traded due to the age or depth of the
issue.
(3) When time constraints due to unusual circumstances preclude use of the bidding
process.
(4) When a security is unique to a single dealer.
(5) When the transaction involves new issues or issues in the "when issued" market.
(c) When using the competitive bid process, all bids shall become part of the record of the
specific security involved. When selection is made based on comparison to current market
price, the following information shall become part of the record of the security involved:
(1) Reason for use of this method.
(2) Source of the current market value used.
(3) Price and/or interest rate quoted by said source.
(Ord. No. 95-44, § 1, 12-19-95)
§ 2-514. Internal controls.
202/246
The finance director will establish a system of internal controls which will be documented
in writing. The internal controls will be reviewed and approved by the investment
committee. The controls will be designed to prevent losses of public funds arising from
fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial
markets, or imprudent action by employees and officers of the city.
(Ord. No. 95-44, § 1, 12-19-95)
§ 2-515. Reporting.
A portfolio report will be provided to the city commission on a quarterly basis. The report
shall include a breakdown of the portfolio as well as its overall performance during that
period. A recapitulation report will be provided to the city commission on an annual basis.
(Ord. No. 95-44, § 1, 12-19-95)
§ 2-516. Resolution of conflicts.
In any instance where the permitted investments authorized in this policy are in conflict
with permitted investments specified in any resolution or agreement approved by the city
commission related to short-term or long-term debt issuances of the City of Lake Wales,
then the provision of the debt-related resolution or agreement will prevail.
(Ord. No. 95-44, § 1, 12-19-95)
Division 2. Agreements
§ 2-517. Hedge agreements.
With the approval of the city commission, the city may enter into one (1) or more hedge
agreements, including interest rate agreements; provided, however, the finance director, or
any other official responsible for making and managing such hedge agreement(s), shall
have developed sufficient understanding of the hedge agreement(s) and have the expertise
to manage the hedge agreement(s).
(Ord. No. 2003-35, § 1, 12-2-03)
Division 3. Establishing Rules For Administration And Use Of Funds In
Emergency Sinking Accounts
§ 2-550. Definitions.
For the purpose of this division the following words, terms or phrases shall have the
meaning ascribed to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
Emergency sinking account. Checking, saving and/or investments accounts.
Non-discretionary spending. Spending that is required by a contract or other commitment.
Operating expenditures. Appropriated financial resources necessary for the operational
costs, excluding:
(a) Capital expenditures;
(b) Debt service;
203/246
(c) Depreciation/amortization; and
(d) Transfers to other funds.
(Ord. No. 2011-11, § 1, 7-19-11)
§ 2-551. Creation of reserve accounts.
There is hereby created, in each of the various governmental fund types (general fund,
special revenue funds, debt service funds, and capital projects funds) and proprietary fund
type (enterprise funds) of the city, reserve accounts equal to the following:
( 1 ) General fundEmergency sinking account. In the general fund, there shall be
created an emergency sinking account with a lower limit of fifteen (15) percent and an
upper limit of twenty (20) percent of general fund operating expenditures calculated
based on the original adopted fiscal year budget. The purposes of the sinking account
shall be:
a. To advance the funds necessary to pay for non-discretionary expenses such as payroll
and insurance premiums that must be paid during the first quarter of the fiscal year and
that will be reimbursed when ad valorem revenues are received; and
b. To advance the funds necessary to pay for construction of grant-funded projects that
will be reimbursed by federal or state agencies; and
c. To advance financial resources necessary for responding to emergencies that will be
reimbursed by insurance proceeds or grants from FEMA or other federal or state
agencies; and
d. To mitigate current and future revenue shortfalls, unanticipated expenditures, and to
ensure stable tax rates.
(2) Special revenue funds. By definition, special revenue funds are created to account
for the proceeds of specific revenue sources (other than expendable trusts or for major
capital projects) that are legally committed to expenditure for specified purposes. As
such, no specific reservation of funds is created by virtue of enactment of this division;
rather the amount of any reservation of funds shall be governed by the legal authority
underlying the commitment.
(3) Debt service fund. Debt service funds are typically subjected to the creation of very
specific committed amounts as a part of the ordinance or resolution which authorizes the
issuance of the debt instrument which is being repaid. Therefore, this policy does not
create any specific reservation of funds within the debt service fund; rather, reserve
requirements for any outstanding city debt instruments will be as derived from the
ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of the debt.
(4) Capital projects fund. The capital projects fund was created to account for financial
resources to be used for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities and
improvements. Occasionally, these projects may extend beyond a single fiscal year. At a
minimum at fiscal year-end committed funds, coupled with estimated revenues for the
ensuing fiscal year, must be sufficient to fund all outstanding fund obligations.
(5) Utility systemEmergency sinking account. In the utility system fund, there shall be
created an emergency sinking account with a lower limit of fifteen (15) percent and an
upper limit of twenty (20) percent of utility system operating expenses based on the
original adopted fiscal year budget. The purposes of the sinking account shall be:
204/246
a. To advance the funds necessary to pay for construction of grant-funded projects that
will be reimbursed by federal or state agencies; and
b. To advance financial resources necessary for responding to emergencies that will be
reimbursed by insurance proceeds or grants from FEMA or other federal or state
agencies; and
c. To mitigate current and future revenue shortfalls, unanticipated expenditures, and to
ensure stable fee structure.
(Ord. No. 2011-11, § 1, 7-19-11)
§ 2-552. Surplus.
In the event the emergency sinking account balance exceeds the amounts set forth within
the upper limit the surplus may be utilized for any lawful purpose. The following priorities
are recommended:
(1 ) Reduction or avoidance of debt. If there is short-term debt within the fund the
surplus may be applied to reduce or eliminate the debt if financial analysis proves this to
be advantageous for the city.
(2) One-time capital needs. Since a surplus does not represent a recurring source of
revenue it should not be used to fund a recurring expense; however, if a one-time capital
expenditure has been identified, but is not already funded through an appropriation, the
surplus may be appropriated for this use.
(3) Tax, fee, or rate stabilization. Surplus funds may be designed for stabilization in
order to avoid raising taxes, fees, or rates related to a fund in subsequent years.
(Ord. No. 2011-11, § 1, 7-19-11)
§ 2-553. Shortfall.
If it is determined there is a shortfall (an amount below the lower limit of the sinking
account range), the sinking account balance is to be rebuilt through the following
mechanism:
An appropriation during the next annual budget process of at least ten (10) percent of the
lower limit of the sinking account range until the lower limit has been reached. If this is
financially infeasible, a written plan shall be forwarded by the city manager to the
commission for approval in order to restore the sinking account balance to an amount
within the range within a reasonable time frame. The plan may require reduction of
services, increases in taxes, fees, or rates, or some combination thereof.
(Ord. No. 2011-11, § 1, 7-19-11)
Division 4. Debt Policy
§ 2-571. Short title.
This division shall be known as and referred to as the "Lake Wales Debt Policy."
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
205/246
§ 2-572. Introduction.
One of the most important responsibilities of a city is to ensure that the needs of its
citizens are met. The city commission's preferred method of funding is "pay-as-you-go"
capital planning. As with all purchases, if the city were able to purchase capital items
without the use of financing options this would result in the lowest overall cost but the
greatest single annual cash flow decrease. The issuance of debt has historically provided
governments with a major source of funding for capital needs. Because of the high cost of
acquiring or replacing capital assets, governments are often not in a position to be able to
accumulate enough cash from current receipts to pay for necessary improvements. Debt
permits governments to acquire assets as needed rather than wait until a sufficient amount
of cash has been accumulated to begin capital projects or improvements.
Debt issuance is subject to close public scrutiny, because it involves raising large amounts
of money, which obligates future generations of taxpayers. The decision to issue debt has
far-reaching consequences by committing the city's revenues for future periods, and hence,
limiting the city's flexibility in responding to changing service priorities, revenue inflows,
or cost structures. The debt issuance process is complex; therefore, it is important that city
officials recognize the need to understand and formalize a process in order to make
informed and objective judgments with respect to the many decisions that are necessary to
successfully complete a debt transaction.
The foundation of any well-managed debt program is a comprehensive debt policy. A debt
policy sets forth the parameters for issuing and managing debt and provides guidance to
decision makers, helping to ensure that debt is issued prudently and is affordable. A debt
policy recognizes a long-term binding commitment to full and timely repayment of all debt
as an intrinsic requirement for entry into the capital markets. Adherence to a debt policy
helps to ensure that the city maintains a sound debt position and that its credit quality is
protected. A debt policy is beneficial because it enhances the quality of decisions,
rationalizes the decision-making process, identifies objectives to be implemented, and
demonstrates a commitment to long-term financial planning objectives. A consistently
applied debt policy provides evidence to the rating agencies of a community's commitment
to sound financial management and controlled borrowing practices. As such, it is regarded
positively in evaluating a city's creditworthiness. It is important that the debt policy be
reviewed and updated on a regular basis to insure the use of the city's resources to meet its
commitment to provide needed services to its citizens and to maintain sound financial
management practices.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-573. Purpose.
The City of Lake Wales Debt Policy ("debt policy") is intended to establish a framework
for debt issuance and to provide general direction in the planning, implementation and
maintenance of the city's debt program. The debt policy is designed to:
(1) Promote attainment of financial, planning and management objectives;
(2) Take a comprehensive approach to affordability;
(3) Reflect the community attitudes and government philosophy; and
(4) Set limits while preserving flexibility.
206/246
The debt policy will provide guidance to city officials on how to integrate the issuance of
debt with other long-term planning, financial and management objectives; evaluate the
impact of each issue on the city's overall financial position; and provide guidance so as not
to exceed acceptable levels of indebtedness.
While the debt policy establishes a framework for debt issuance, it is written to be
sufficiently flexible to permit the city to take advantage of market opportunities and to
respond to changing conditions without jeopardizing essential public services.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-574. Purpose for which debt may be issued.
The city will consider long-term financing for the acquisition, maintenance, replacement,
or expansion of physical assets (including land) with a useful life of at least five (5) years.
The repayment term of any debt should not exceed seventy (70) percent of the asset(s)
estimated useful life. (Example: If the estimated use life of an asset is ten (10) years, the
debt issuance for this item should not exceed seven (7) years.) In the situation of multiple
assets being financed within one (1) debt issuance, an averaging of the multiple estimated
useful lives and variable costs shall be considered by the city commission relating to the
debt financing terms for both reasonableness and cost efficiency. The city normally will
rely on internally generated funds and/or grants and contributions from other governments
to finance its capital needs. Debt will be issued for a capital project only in the case of
emergency or when it is an appropriate means to achieve a fair allocation of costs between
current and future beneficiaries. Debt shall not, in general, be used for projects solely
because insufficient funds are budgeted at the time of acquisition or construction.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-575. Moral obligation pledges.
Recognizing that a city's potential can be measured by the service delivery of its
infrastructure. it is the responsibility of the city's officials to:
(1) Recognize the city's limited inventory of pledgable revenues and the need to manage
the use/commitment of these revenues as the consumption of a scarce resource;
( 2 ) Maintain the current systems, structures and facilities and their service delivery
potential and to add building blocks (additions, modifications and expansion) as needed;
(3 ) Ensure that decision making with regard to city debt will focus on the need to
measure interperiod equity between fiscal years and generations of taxpayers, users and
other beneficiaries. Take actions to ensure the fair distribution of costs between periods
while equally striving to maintain future flexibility to address unanticipated capital
requirements;
(4 ) Employ the use of debt to complement, and not in lieu of significant recurring
commitments of annual appropriations for capital purposes;
(5) Act as fiduciaries, for their time as responsible officials, to ensure that each transfers
to their successors a city in at least as good a shape (financial, physical, service delivery
potential, etc.) as they received from their predecessors; and
207/246
(6) Maintain the city's sound financial position, reasonable reserves and positive debt
posture and thereby enhance the city's flexibility and related ability to meet the challenges
of its future generations.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-576. Categorization of debt.
(a) Self-supporting debt. To be considered self-supporting, a propriety or governmental
debt program will:
(1) Be payable exclusively from non-general fund revenues; and
(2) In the case of governmental debt, be secured by a revenue source which has been in
effect for at least three (3) years, and would have provided coverage of at least one
hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the average annual debt service on such
obligations; or if the revenue source has not been in existence for at least three (3) years,
be secured by a revenue source that would have provided coverage of at least one
hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the average annual debt service on such obligation
for at least the last full fiscal year preceding the issuance of such obligations and is
projected to provide at least one hundred twenty-five (125) percent debt service coverage
for each of the next two years;
(3 ) In the case of proprietary fund debt or special assessment debt, be secured by a
revenue source which would provide a coverage in each fiscal year of at least one
hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the annual debt service in such fiscal year.
(4) It is anticipated through financial forecasts that no inter-fund contributions from the
general fund, without commission approval or consent, to the specific proprietary or
governmental fund will be required to make up an operating short fall.
For purposes of calculating the coverage requirements, historical and projected receipts of
a particular revenue source will be adjusted retroactively to the initial date of the
calculation period to reflect changes in rates or levies enacted.
(b) Non self-supporting. Includes all debt of the city that does not meet the definition of
self supporting debt.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-577. Debt limitations.
( a ) Self-supporting debt. For the city to issue self-supporting governmental debt,
revenues, as defined under the resolution authorizing the revenue bonds in question, shall
be a minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the debt service for the year in
which requirements are scheduled to be the greatest. For proprietary debt, revenues shall be
a minimum of one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the annual debt service in such
fiscal year. Annual adjustments to the city's rate structures will be made as necessary to
maintain the required coverage factors.
( b) Non self-supporting debt. The city shall conduct an objective analysis as to the
community's ability to assume and support additional debt service payments before the
issuance of non-self supported debt. The city shall use an analytical approach for its
determination. This process shall compare generally accepted standards of affordability to
the current values for the city.
208/246
(1) These standards shall include (1) debt per capita, (2) debt as a percent of taxable
value, (3) debt service payments as a percent of current revenues and current
expenditures, and (4) the level of overlapping net debt of all local taxing jurisdictions.
(2) An examination the direct costs and benefits of the proposed expenditures.
(3) Staff shall provide the city commission with a "financial condition assessment" based
on financial indicators and benchmarks provided by the State of Florida Auditor General
Office. Auditor general staff compile the information from audit reports and other
sources.(Data source: http://www.myflorida.com/audgen/pages/fca_procedures.htm).
Staff shall include an analysis of how any new debt would affect the city's financial
condition.
The decision on whether or not to assume new debt shall be based on the identified costs
and benefits, the current conditions of the municipal bond market, and the city's ability to
"afford" new debt as determined by the aforementioned standards. The city shall strive to
achieve and/or maintain these standards at a low to moderate classification.
(c) Debt burden measures. For the purposes of measuring the general government debt
capacity, the city includes all non self-supporting debt under the definition of general
government debt. These are the programs whose expenditures for debt service are in direct
competition with other general fund expenditures. Additionally, the city considers all tax
supported debt to include all non self-supporting debt, as well as the self-supporting
governmental debt. This distinction recognizes that self-supporting proprietary programs
should be measured by comparing the user rates of comparable governmental providers,
and that such programs do not directly or indirectly place a burden on taxpayers in the form
of increased taxes. As long as each system's user rates meet the needs of both operations
and debt service, the debt program is not considered part of either the general government
or tax supported debt of the city.
(d) The city commission commits to:
(1) Act with regard to self-supporting proprietary operations, when necessary, to increase
rates to ensure that each operation maintains rate coverage (revenue to debt service
ratios) as required by the higher of either city policy or related debt covenants.
(2) Limit with regard to self-supporting governmental revenues, the level of annual debt
service as a percentage of available annual revenues to ensure a reasonable ability to
address recurring operations and maintenance and/or capital requirements on a pay-asyou-
go basis.
(3) Establish with regard to all non self-supporting debt, debt limits to ensure current and
future flexibility.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-578. Types of debt permitted and the criteria for issuance.
209/246
(a) Short term debt. Current revenues and/or working capital reserves are expected to
cover the expenses associated with the day-to-day operations of the city. However, shortterm
obligations may be issued to finance projects or portions of projects for which the
city ultimately intends to issue long-term debt. Short term debt shall be defined as any debt
that is fully due within a twelve-month period. It can be used to provide interim financing
which will be refunded with the proceeds of long-term obligations. Interim financing may
be appropriate when long-term interest rates are expected to decline in the future. In
addition, some forms of short-term obligations can be obtained quicker than long term
obligations and thus can be used in emergencies until long-term financing can be obtained.
The city will conduct an analysis of the cost differential of issuing short-term debt to
provide for immediate needs versus long-term debt to cover both immediate and future
needs taking into account the carrying costs of long term financing which does not have an
immediate use.
(b) Long term debt. The city will consider the issuance of long-term debt under the
following conditions:
(1) One (1) time capital projects or capital improvement projects, when the project is
included in the city's capital improvement program and appropriated in the budget.
( 2 ) An unusual equipment purchase for which it is determined to be economically
beneficial for the city to purchase through financing. For unusual equipment purchases,
city staff shall provide the city commission with a comparison of the annual cost of
renting the equipment compared to the annual debt service obligation of purchasing the
equipment. An estimate of the useful life expectancy of the equipment shall also be
provided.
(3) When a project is not included in the city's capital improvement plan, but it is an
emerging critical need whose timing was not anticipated or it is a project mandated
immediately by state or federal requirements. An analysis of the project's impact on the
city's capital improvement plan and future budget forecasts will be presented at the time
of approval.
(4 ) To finance the acquisition or implementation of a self-supporting proprietary or
governmental program/activity.
(c) General obligation bonds. When determined to be the most appropriate method of
debt issuance, the city will seek approval through voter referendum to issue general
obligation bonds. General obligation bonds are either backed by the full faith and credit of
the city, with a pledge to levy the necessary ad valorem tax rate to meet the debt service
requirements; or of a limited nature were the voters approve a specified millage rate to
pledge.
(d) Revenue debt. As part of the city's financing activities, specific general fund revenue
sources may be identified to pledge for repayment of revenue debt. Recognizing the limited
capacity of the city's general fund to support both ongoing operating programs and secure
debt obligations, use of the general fund to secure such obligations must be approved after
careful review of financial forecasts. Key factors that will be considered in determining
whether or not the general fund should be used to secure a particular debt obligation will
include the following:
( 1 ) Demonstration of underlying self-support, thus limiting potential general fund
financial exposure.
210/246
(2) Use of general fund support as a transition to a fully stand alone credit structure,
where interim use of general fund credit support reduces borrowing costs and provides a
credit history for new or hard to establish credits.
(3) General fund support is determined by the city commission to be in the city's overall
best interest.
The city will finance the capital needs of its revenue producing proprietary activities
through the issuance of revenue-secured debt obligations. Prior to approval of such debt,
the city commission will evaluate financial plans and projections showing the feasibility of
the planned financing, required rates and charges needed to support the planned financing,
and the impact of the planned financing on ratepayers, property owners, city revenues, and
other affected parties. The amount of the debt obligations issued by a city will be limited
by the feasibility of the overall financing plan on the proprietary activity.
(e) Variable rate debt. The city commission chooses not to issue securities that pay a rate
of interest that varies according to pre-determined formula or results from a periodic
remarketing of the securities, consistent with state law and covenants of pre-existing
bonds, and depending on market conditions.
(f) Leasing. When found to be advantageous, the city may lease equipment and facilities
rather than purchase them outright. Leasing may be appropriate for assets that will be
needed for only a short period of time, or which are subject to rapid technological
obsolescence. Leasing may also be determined to be appropriate for procuring assets that
are too expensive to fund with current receipts in any one (1) year, but with useful lives
too short to finance with long-term debt. The decision to lease will be supported by an
analysis of lease vs. purchase.
(g) Conduit debt. Conduit debt are securities issued by a government agency to finance a
project of a third party, such as a non-profit organization or other private entity. The city
may sponsor conduit debt for those activities (e.g., economic development, housing) that
have a general public purpose and are consistent with the city's overall service and policy
objectives. Unless a compelling public policy rationale exists, such conduit debt will not in
any way pledge the city's full faith and credit.
(h) Taxable debt. The cost of taxable debt is higher than tax exempt debt. The issuance of
taxable debt is mandated in certain circumstances, and may allow valuable flexibility in
subsequent contracts with users or managers of the improvement constructed with the debt
proceeds. Therefore, the city may issue taxable obligations when determined to be the best
method for the intended purpose.
(i) Bond anticipation notes. Use of short-term borrowing, such as bond anticipation notes
and tax-exempt commercial paper, will be undertaken only if the transaction costs plus
interest of the debt are less than the cost of internal financing, or available cash is
insufficient to meet working capital requirements.
(j) Interfund borrowing. Interfund borrowing will be considered to finance high priority
needs on a case-by-case basis, only when planned expenditures in the fund making the loan
would not be affected. Interfund borrowing may be used when it would reduce costs of
interest, debt issuance, and/or administration.
(k) Other borrowing facilities. The city may maintain or procure a special facility that will
allow for borrowing on short notice, either in the form of short-term or long-term notes,
for small amounts not economical to finance through a regular bond issuance. The facility
can be used as an interim financing mechanism when cost effective.
211/246
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-579. Structural features that may be considered.
Debt will be structured to achieve the lowest possible net cost to the city given market
conditions, the urgency of the capital project, and the nature and type of security provided.
Moreover, to the extent possible, the city will design the repayment of its overall debt so as
to recapture rapidly its credit capacity for future use. In general, there will be no debt
structures that include increasing debt service levels in subsequent years, with the
exception of the first and second year. There shall be no "balloon" bond repayment
schedules that consist of low annual payments and one (1) large payment of the balance
due at the end of the term. There shall always be at least interest paid in the first fiscal year
after the bond issue.
(1) Backloading. The city will seek to structure debt with level principal and interest
costs-over the life of the debt. Backloading of costs will only be considered in rare
circumstances as follows:
a . When natural disasters or extraordinary/unanticipated external factors make the
short-term cost of the debt prohibitive;
b. When the benefits derived from the debt issuance can clearly be demonstrated to be
greater in the future than in the present;
c. When such structuring is beneficial to the city's overall amortization schedule; or
d . When such structuring will allow debt service to more closely match project
revenues during the early years of the project's operation.
(2) Call provisions. The city seeks to minimize the protection from optional redemption
given to bondholders, consistent with its desire to obtain the lowest possible interest rate
on its debt. The city seeks early call options at low or no premiums to allow for
refinancing of debt at greater interest savings, provided there is no interest rate penalty
for early call. The city shall obtain advice from its financial advisor in the evaluation of
optional call provisions for each issue to assure that the city does not pay unacceptably
higher interest rates to obtain more advantageous call provisions.
(3) Maturity of debt. Debt will be structured for the shortest period consistent with a fair
allocation of costs to current and future beneficiaries or users. Generally, debt maturity
should be of a duration that does not exceed the economic life of the asset or
improvement that it finances and where feasible should be shorter than the projected
economic life, as extended by periodic renewal and component replacement.
(4) Credit enhancements. Credit enhancements are mechanisms that guarantee principal
and interest payments. They include bond insurance, a line of credit or letter of credit. A
credit enhancement, while costly, can result in a lower interest rate on debt and a higher
rating from the rating agencies, thus lowering overall costs. During debt issuance
planning, the city's financial advisor will advise whether or not a credit enhancement is
cost effective under the circumstances and what type of credit enhancement if any, should
be purchased. Credit enhancements may be used, but only when net debt service on the
bonds is reduced by more than the costs of the enhancement.
(5) Subordinate lien obligations. Creation of subordinate lien financing structure, if
appropriate, shall be based on the overall financing needs of the city, expected credit
ratings, relative cost, and impact to the city.
212/246
(6) Derivatives. Excluding existing derivative debt obligations currently outstanding, the
city commission chooses not to employ the use of derivative products that are authorized
under applicable laws. Derivatives are contracts and financing agreements involving
interest rate swaps, floating/fixed rate auction or reset securities, or other forms of debt
bearing synthetically determined interest rates. The use of derivatives can minimize risk,
reduce cost and provide flexibility, however they may also add risk, restrict flexibility
and add cost.
Before entering into such contracts or agreements, a review committee consisting of at a
minimum the city manager, finance director and the city's financial advisor shall be formed
to review the risks and benefits of such financing techniques and expected impacts on the
city's long-term financial operations and credit ratings. The committee's findings will be
presented in a written report to the city commission for consideration.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-580. Credit objectives.
The city seeks to hold the highest possible credit ratings that can be achieved without
compromising delivery of basic city services and achievement of city policy objectives. The
city recognizes that external economic, natural, or other events may from time to time
affect the creditworthiness of its debt. Nevertheless, the city is committed to ensuring that
actions within its control are financially prudent.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-581. Methods of sale.
The city will select a method of sale that is the most appropriate in light of financial,
market, transaction-specific and issuer-related conditions. When a sale is not competitively
bid, the city will publicly present the reasons and will participate with the financial advisor
in the selection of the underwriter or direct purchaser.
( 1 ) Competitive sale. The city, as a matter of policy, shall seek to issue its debt
obligations in a competitive sale unless it is determined that this method would not
produce the best results for the city. The city, with assistance by its financial advisor, will
set the terms of the sale as to encourage as many bidders as possible. In such instances
where the city, in a competitive bidding for its debt securities, deems the bids received as
unsatisfactory or does not receive bids, it may, at the election of the city commission,
enter into negotiation for sale of the securities.
(2) Negotiated sale. When certain conditions favorable for a competitive sale do not
exist and/or when a negotiated sale will provide significant benefits to the city that would
not be achieved through a competitive sale, the city may elect to sell its debt obligations
through a negotiated sale. Such determination may be made on an issue by issue basis,
for a series of issues, or for part or all of a specific financing program.
(3) Private placement. When determined to be beneficial and appropriate, the city may
elect to sell its debt obligations through a private placement or limited public offering.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-582. Selection of professionals.
213/246
The city will employ outside specialists to assist in developing a bond issuance strategy,
preparing bond documents, and marketing bonds to investors. When selecting a financing
team the city will focus on professionals that have the necessary expertise to represent its
interests and to successfully market its bonds. The city will retain professionals under
procedures outlined in the city's procurement policies and procedures. The city will hire
professionals with an understanding of the city's needs, experience with similar types of
securities, knowledge of beneficial approaches to debt financing, an understanding of
innovative debt financing methods which can reduce costs or provide greater flexibility,
and an ability to complete the transaction in a timely manner without undue burden to the
city.
(1) Financial advisor. The city will seek the advice of a financial advisor as needed. The
financial advisor will advise on the structuring of obligations to be issued, inform the
city of various options, advise the city as to how choices will impact the marketability of
the city obligations and will provide other services as defined. To ensure independence,
the financial advisor will not bid on nor underwrite any city debt issues.
(2) Bond counsel. The city will retain external bond counsel for all debt issues. All debt
issued by the city will include a written opinion by bond counsel affirming that the city is
authorized to issue the debt, stating that the city has met all state constitutional and
statutory requirements necessary for issuance, and determining the debt's federal income
tax status. The city attorney, as counsel for the issuer, will affirm the city's legal status
and authority for borrowing in the manner contemplated.
(3) Underwriters. Underwriters will be required to demonstrate sufficient capitalization
and experience related to debt issuance.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-583. Refunding of debt.
Periodic reviews of all outstanding debt will be undertaken to determine refunding
opportunities. Refunding will be considered if and when a net economic benefit is
produced or the refunding is required in order to modernize debt covenants essential to
operations and management. Advance refunding for economic savings will be undertaken
when a targeted net present value savings of at least five (5) percent can be achieved or
when a lower percentage is found to be in the best monetary interest of the city. Current
refundings, which produce net present value savings, of less than five (5) percent will be
considered on a case-by-case basis. Refunding with negative savings will not be considered
unless there is a compelling public policy objective. The city may choose to refund
outstanding indebtedness when debt covenants or other financial structures impinge on
prudent and sound financial management. Savings requirements for current or advance
refunding undertaken to restructure debt may be waived by the city commission upon a
finding that such a restructuring is in the city's overall best financial interests.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-584. Debt defeasance.
214/246
The city may defease its debt by irrevocably placing cash or other assets in a trust to be
used solely for satisfying scheduled payments of both the interest and principal of the
defeased debt. In this situation, the trust is restricted to owning only monetary assets that
are essentially risk free as to the amount, timing and collection of interest and principal.
Additionally, the city may choose to defease its outstanding indebtedness through
purchases of its securities on the open market when market conditions make such an
option financially feasible. The city will develop procedures for executing and biding open
market purchases and the savings objectives to be achieved by undertaking such actions.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-585. Disclosure practices.
The city is committed to full and complete financial disclosure, and to cooperating fully
with rating agencies, institutional and individual investors, other levels of government, and
the general public to share clear, comprehensible, and accurate financial information. The
city is committed to meeting all disclosure requirements on a timely and comprehensive
basis and will contract for the provision of such disclosure information when necessary.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-586. Compliance with federal tax law provisions.
Federal arbitrage regulations were put into place for two (2) primary reasons: (1) to ensure
that the proceeds of tax-exempt financing are not solely being used to make investment in
higher-yielding taxable securities, and (2) to ensure that the bond proceeds are spent in an
expeditious manner. In compliance with the spirit of this legislation, the city will not issue
obligations except for identifiable projects with a prospect of timely initiation. The city's
finance director is responsible for ensuring that a system of record keeping and reporting is
maintained to meet the arbitrage rebate requirements of the federal tax code.
The city's finance director will monitor compliance with debt covenants and adherence to
federal regulations. Any instances of noncompliance will be reported by the city manager
to the city commission.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-587. Integration of capital planning and debt financing activities.
(a) Capital planning and financing system. The city shall develop and maintain a capital
planning and financing system for use in preparing a five-year capital improvement plan for
consideration and adoption by the city commission as part of the city's annual budget
process. Individual departments shall prepare multi-year capital plans for coordination and
integration into the preparation of the citywide capital improvement plan.
(b) Funding of the capital improvement program. Whenever possible, the city will first
attempt to fund capital projects with grants or developer contributions. When such funds
are insufficient, the city will use dedicated revenues such as impact fees or other restricted
use revenues. If these are not available, the city will use general revenues, surplus and bond
financing. The city is guided by three (3) principles in selecting a funding source for capital
improvements - equity, effectiveness and efficiency:
215/246
 Equity. When appropriate, the beneficiaries of a project or service will pay for it. For
example, if a project is a general function of government that benefits the entire
community, the project could be funded from general tax revenues directly or through
debt service. If the project benefits specific users the source of funding will be derived
through user fees/charges or targeted assessments.
 Effectiveness. In selection of financing sources for projects, the city will select one (1)
or more that effectively fund the total cost of the project.
 Efficiency. If grants or current revenues are not available to fund a project, the city will
select a financing technique that provides for the lowest total cost consistent with
acceptable risk factors and principles of equity and effectiveness.
( c ) Maintenance, replacement and renewal. Consistent with the city's philosophy of
keeping its capital facilities and infrastructure systems in good repair and to maximize the
useful life of its capital assets, the city intends to set aside current revenues to finance
ongoing maintenance needs and to provide periodic replacement and renewal.
(Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 2-5-13)
§ 2-588. Investment of debt proceeds.
Debt proceeds will be invested primarily to assure the safety and liquidity of such
investments, and secondarily, to maximize investment yield. The primary goal of liquidity
is to ensure that proceeds will be available to fulfill the purposes of the issue on a timely
basis. Debt covenants will specifically address investment guidelines for debt proceeds.

cemeteries, the following shall apply: (note: corner markers are only allowed in the Lake
Wales Cemetery and the Willow Lawn Cemetery; corner markers will not be allowed in the

cost of one (1) foundation inspection. Additional inspections will require payment of a
twenty-five-dollar service fee by the monument company. No additional fee will be
required for the actual placement of the monument or marker onto the foundation.
(2) Monument or upright marker. For monuments having a vertical height of three (3)
feet or less, a foundation shall be installed that is three (3) inches wider than the
monument on all four (4) sides so that a three-inch margin is created around the base of
the monument. For monuments taller than three (3) feet, the width of the foundation

steel bar one-half (½) inch in diameter.
(4) All foundations. In all installations, the foundation shall be constructed upon wellcompacted
soil. The foundation shall be constructed of Portland-based concrete and shall
have a minimum designed strength of two thousand (2,000) pounds per square inch (psi).
Foundations shall be constructed with the use of forming for the upper four (4) inches of
the cast-in-place concrete. Wood forms are permitted, but must be removed after the
concrete has cured in place. The surface of the foundation shall be level and have a
smooth float finish and shall finish at least one and one-half (1½) inches below the
grade. After curing of the concrete foundation, form work shall be removed and the area
back-filled with screened topsoil prior to setting of the monument or marker.
( 5 ) Inspection. All foundations shall be inspected by the cemetery manager. If the
foundation installation is determined to be satisfactory, the cemetery manager shall issue
written authorization to the monument company to proceed with the setting of the
monument or marker. A copy of this written authorization shall be provided to the family
and shall serve as notice to the family that the foundation has been installed
satisfactorily. If the foundation installation is determined to be unsatisfactory, the
cemetery manager shall issue written notice to the monument company requiring that the
problem(s) be corrected. No authorization shall be issued to proceed with the setting of
the monument or marker until the foundation installation is determined to be
satisfactory.
(6) Time of inspection. To facilitate inspection by the cemetery manager, all foundations
shall be set between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. If it is necessary to set a

herein for installation of any foundation, monument or marker, if, in the sole discretion
of the building official, such modification is deemed to be desirable.
(g) Where a monument or marker has been previously set, no monument or marker shall be
engraved unless the burial space has been located by the cemetery manager or his
designated representative. The cemetery manager shall clearly mark the burial space upon
which the monument or marker will be engraved and shall issue written authorization to
the monument company to proceed with the engraving of the monument or marker. A
request for authorization must be made to the cemetery manager by 4:00 p.m. on the
business day preceding the day on which the engraving of the monument or marker will
occur.
(h) Any monument or marker which has been set in violation of the rules and regulations
established by this section shall be removed from the grave site by the monument company.
It shall be the responsibility of the monument company to reset the monument or marker in
accordance with the rules and regulations of this section without charge to the owner or
the city.
(i) Lettering on mausoleum crypts and niches shall comply with all requirements
established by the city for uniformity. Any lettering which has been placed on a crypt or
niche which fails to comply with all such requirements shall be replaced by the monument
company without charge to the owner or city.
232/246
(j) It shall not be the responsibility of the city to replace or repair temporary metal grave
markers, and all temporary grave markers shall be removed when the permanent marker is
set. Any temporary grave marker remaining on the grave six (6) months after the interment
shall be removed by the cemetery manager at no risk to the city. Prior to removal, notice
shall be provided in accordance with section 6-245, and the family of the deceased shall be
given the option of installing a memorial brick in lieu of the monument or marker required
in paragraph (c). The brick shall be purchased from the city, and shall be inscribed with the

memorial brick on a foundation at the head of the grave. The memorial brick may remain
on the grave as a permanent marker or until replacement by a bronze, granite or marble
monument or marker. A family may elect to install a memorial brick immediately
following the burial in lieu of placing a temporary metal grave marker.

ornaments on any monument or memorial, it disclaims responsibility and shall not be
liable for any damage or injury thereto.

(a) Permanent planting, maintenance and removal of grasses, shrubs, trees, flowers, and the
like, shall be done only by the city.
(1) The planting of trees, shrubs and other plants in a memorial section violates the

and plants are properly maintained by the family. The cemetery manager may remove the
trees, shrubs or plants when they become unsightly, dangerous, detrimental or diseased or
when they interfere with the normal maintenance of the cemetery. Notice of such
removal shall not be required.
(3) Any permanent trees, shrubs, flowers, or similar items planted anywhere in a city
cemetery after December 1, 2009 shall be removed by the city following notice as
required in section 2-645. Plantings so removed may be transplanted to a common area

with the normal maintenance of the cemetery. Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this
section, notice of such removal shall not be required.
(c) The city shall not be liable for frozen plants or herbage of any kind or for plantings
damaged by the elements, thieves, vandals or by other causes beyond its control.

(30) days. If not called for and removed by the end of the thirty-day period, such flowers,
baskets, designs or frames shall become the property of the city and may be sold, destroyed
or otherwise disposed of without incurring any liability whatsoever to donors, grave
owners or their legal representatives.
(e) All vases and receptacles must be approved by the city. Approved vases may be of the
invertible type. Fixed vases shall not exceed six (6) inches in diameter and ten (10) inches
in height. No other receptacle may be used as a permanent vase. A frame may be used in
lieu of a vase to support non-live flowers placed on a grave site on special dates or until a
permanent marker can be installed, provided that the combined height of the frame and
non-live flowers does not exceed twenty-four (24) inches. Glass or ceramic containers
shall not be permitted under any circumstances.

Cemetery subject to the following:

(24) inches in height;
(3) A potted plant shall not bear thorns or stickers or otherwise be potentially hazardous

(4) A potted plant shall be maintained by the family, and, if not maintained by the family,
shall be removed by the cemetery manager in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
section.
(g) Potted plants will not be allowed in the Lake Wales Memorial Gardens Cemetery.

or agent of such person or any other activation of the alarm system not caused by forced
entry, attempted forced entry, or robbery; or not caused by fire, heat or smoke, or bona fide
medical emergency; provided, however, false alarm does not include alarms caused by acts
of God or by external power failure or those alarms intentionally activated by an owner,
lessee, occupant, recipient, or manager of premises who visually observed or heard
suspicious circumstances which would cause a careful and prudent person to believe that a
fire, forced entry, robbery, or other felony was in progress at the premises protected by the
alarm system.

the expense of responding to a false alarm.

fire department shall be dispatched to the premises where the alarm has been activated or
learns of the activation of the alarm system, by any means whatsoever, and responds thereto
by traveling to that premises. After responding to a false alarm, the enforcement official
shall notify any person identified in the notice required pursuant to section 4-28 of the
activation of the alarm system. If the alarm is audible and does not deactivate

system. Should the person notified fail to appear at the premises to deactivate the alarm
system within one-half (½) hour after being notified to do so, the city shall charge the
owner a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00); provided, however, if the owner is prevented

alarm, the corrective action taken and the name, address and telephone number of any
maintenance, repair or serviceman who inspected or repaired the alarm system following
the false alarm, as well as such other information as the enforcement official may deem is

CHAPTER 5. ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
§ 5-1. Legislative findings and intent.
Alcohol abuse is a factor in violent crimes such as assault and battery and increases the
frequency and severity of vehicle crashes. A disproportionate number of calls for service
received by the police department originate from establishments that permit the
consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises. An unreasonable amount of law
enforcement resources are allocated to these establishments to preserve the public peace.
Accordingly, the regulation of alcoholic beverages may reduce crime and disorder.
In accordance with authority granted by F.S. § 562.14, this chapter is intended to regulate
the hours during which alcoholic beverages may be sold, consumed, served or permitted to
be served within the city limits at any establishment holding a license from the Division of
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco of the Florida Department of Business and Professional
Regulation.
In accordance with authority granted by F.S. § 562.45, this chapter is intended to regulate
the location within the city limits of any establishment holding a license from the Division
of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco of the Florida Department of Business and
Professional Regulation.
This chapter is further intended to establish prohibited acts relating to the sale, service,
possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages within the city limits.
All police powers granted by F.S. ch. 562 shall be exercised by the city to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the public.
(Ord. No. 2009-25, § 1, 10-20-09)
§ 5-2. Applicability.
In addition to all provisions of chapters 561 and 562, Florida Statutes, hereinafter referred
to as the Florida Beverage Law, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the sale,
service, possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages within the corporate limits of
the city.

that derives at least fifty-one (51) percent of its gross revenue from the sale of food and
nonalcoholic beverages.
Retail sales establishment means a business that is engaged primarily in the retail sale of
consumer goods or services. Convenience stores and retail service stations are included in
the definition of a retail sales establishment.

alcoholic beverage in connection with, or as a part of a transfer of property other than an
alcoholic beverage for a consideration, or the serving of an alcoholic beverage by a club
licensed under the Florida Beverage Law.
Wine means all beverages made from fresh fruits, berries or grapes, either by natural
fermentation or by natural fermentation with brandy added, in the manner required by the
laws and regulations of the United States, and includes all sparkling wines, champagnes,

(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-3. General findings.
It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that:
(1) Pursuant to Article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and
166.041, the city commission has all powers of local self-government to perform
municipal functions and to render municipal services in a manner not inconsistent with
law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of city ordinances.
(2) The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power
for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city
commission may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may
act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3). The
subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) F.S. § 166.021(3) are not relevant to the
imposition of assessments related to fire protection services, facilities or programs of the
city. The purpose of the ordinance establishing chapter 10.5 of the City Code is to
provide procedures and standards for the imposition of city-wide fire protection
assessments under the general home rule powers of a municipality to impose special
assessments; to authorize a procedure for the funding of fire protection services,
facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city; and to
legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from the
provision of combined fire control and first response medical services by the city under
its consolidated fire protection program.
6/18
(3) On December 18, 2007, the city commission, after appropriate advertising and a
public hearing, adopted Resolution 2007-22 and declared its intent to use the uniform
method of collection for non-ad valorem assessments under F.S. § 197.3632. The city
subsequently provided the Polk County Property Appraiser and the Polk County Tax
Collector with the required notices by registered mail as required under F.S. § 197.3632.
(4) The annual fire protection assessments to be imposed using the procedures provided
in this chapter shall constitute non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent
of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.
(5) The fire protection assessments to be imposed using the procedures provided in this
chapter are imposed by the city commission, not the board of county commissioners,
property appraiser or tax collector. The duties of the property appraiser and tax collector
under the provisions of this chapter and the Uniform Assessment Collection Act are
ministerial.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-4. Legislative determination of special benefit to property.
It is hereby ascertained and declared that the fire protection services, facilities, and
programs provide a special benefit to property that is improved by the existence or
construction of a building based upon the following legislative determinations:
(1) Fire protection services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of
improved property by:
a. Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the provision of
available fire protection services;
b . Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of
improvements and structures within improved parcels;
c . Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and
comprehensive fire protection program within the city; and
d . Containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on vacant property with the
potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property.
(2) The combined fire suppression and first response medical services of the city under
its existing consolidated fire protection program enhance and strengthen the relationship
of such services to the use and enjoyment of buildings within improved parcels of
property within the areas served by the city.
(3) The combined fire control and first response medical services of the city under its
existing consolidated fire protection program enhance the value of business and
commercial property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building; this
enhanced value can be anticipated to be reflected in the rental charge or value of such
business or commercial property.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-5. General authority.
7/18
( a ) The city commission is hereby authorized to impose an annual fire protection
assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire protection assessed cost upon benefitted

assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this chapter.
(b) The amount of the fire protection assessment imposed in a fiscal year against a parcel
of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based

special benefit provided by fire protection services, facilities, or programs funded with
assessment proceeds.
(c) Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to require the imposition of fire
protection assessments against government property.

§ 10.5-11. Effect of final assessment resolution.
10/18
The fire protection assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption
of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be
the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the
determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property; the
method of apportionment and assessment; the initial rate of assessment; the maximum
assessment rate, if any; the initial assessment roll; and the levy and lien of the fire

(f) In the event that (1) the proposed fire protection assessment for any fiscal year exceeds
the rates of assessment adopted by the city commission including a maximum assessment
rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously provided to the owners of assessed
property pursuant to sections 10.5-8 and 10.5-9, (2) the purpose for which the fire

this chapter.
( g) As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the

action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or
interpreted to affect the finality of any fire protection assessment not challenged within the

against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an assessment roll
approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution.
(h) The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the

adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
12/18
§ 10.5-13. Lien of fire protection assessments.
Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire protection assessments shall constitute a
lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county,
district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law,
such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims,
until paid. The lien for a fire protection assessment shall be deemed perfected upon
adoption by the city commission of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate
resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire protection assessment collected
under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property included on the
assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under
the tax roll. The lien for a fire protection assessment collected under the alternative method
of collection provided in section 10.5-19 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the
city commission of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever
is applicable, and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-14. Revisions to fire protection assessments.
If any fire protection assessment made under the provisions of this chapter is either in
whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city
commission is satisfied that any such fire protection assessment is so irregular or defective
that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city commission has failed to
include or omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so
included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire protection
assessment against any property benefited by the fire protection assessed costs, following
as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this chapter and in case such second fire
protection assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city commission may obtain
and impose other fire protection assessments until a valid fire protection assessment is
imposed.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-15. Immateriality of procedural irregularities.
Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire
protection assessment under the provisions of this chapter shall not affect the validity of
the same after the approval thereof, and any fire protection assessment as finally approved
shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire protection assessment was duly
levied, that the fire protection assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other
proceedings adequate to such fire protection assessment were duly had, taken, and
performed as required by this chapter; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall
be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured
thereby.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-16. Correction of errors and omissions.
(a) No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city
manager, city commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or
discharge any obligation for payment of a fire protection assessment imposed by the city
commission under the provision of this chapter.
13/18
(b) When it shall appear that any fire protection assessment should have been imposed
under this chapter against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire
protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the
assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll
as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved
by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the city commission may, upon
provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed
parcel in the manner and form provided in section 10.5-9, impose the applicable fire
protection assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in
addition to the applicable fire protection assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years.
Such fire protection assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in
rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special
assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and
claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in this
chapter 10.5, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution
imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments.
(c) Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time,
upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of
any property subject to a fire protection assessment, to reclassify property based upon
presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the
fire protection assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not
otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way
affect the enforcement of the fire protection assessment imposed under the provisions of
this chapter. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes,
modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and
not the property appraiser or tax collector.
(d) After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto
shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and
insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-17. Interim assessments.
14/18
(a) An interim fire protection assessment may be imposed against all property for which a
building permit is issued after the adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of
the interim fire protection assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall
be one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the
annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim fire protection assessment is
being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining
in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire protection assessment
may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire protection assessment.
Issuance of the building permit without the payment in full of the interim fire protection
assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment.
Any interim fire protection assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the building
permit may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in
section 10.5-18, under the alternative collection method provided in section 10.5-19, or by
any other method authorized by law. Any interim fire protection assessment shall be
deemed due and payable on the date the building permit was issued and shall constitute a
lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with
the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and
superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or
against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the
building permit.
(b) In the event a building permit expires prior to completion of a the building for which it
was issued, and the applicant paid the interim fire protection assessment at the time the
building permit was issued, the applicant may within ninety (90) days of the expiration of
the building permit apply for a refund of the interim fire protection assessment. Failure to
timely apply for a refund of the fire protection assessment shall waive any right to a refund.
(c) The application for refund shall be filed with the city and contain the following:
(1) The name and address of the applicant;
(2) The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property
which was the subject of the building permit;
(3) The date the fire protection assessment was paid; and
(4) The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration.
(d) After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the building has not been
completed, the city shall refund the interim fire protection assessment paid for such
building.
(e) A building permit which is subsequently issued for a building on the same property
which was subject of a refund shall pay the interim fire protection assessment as required
by this section 10.5-17
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-18. Method of collection.
(a) Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the fire protection assessments shall
be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all applicable provisions of the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this chapter may be
combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection
Act or other provision of law.
15/18
(b) The amount of a fire protection assessment to be collected using the uniform method
pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted
property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees
and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or
program provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with the prior year's
assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner as required under
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the
prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such fire protection assessment
upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city.
(Ord. No. 2008-26, § 1, 8-4-08)
§ 10.5-19. Alternative method of collection.
In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city commission may elect
to collect the fire protection assessments by any other method which is authorized by law
or under the alternative collection method provided by this section:
(1) The city commission shall provide fire protection assessment bills by first class mail
to the owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government property. The bill
or accompanying explanatory material shall include:
a. A brief explanation of the fire protection assessment;
b. A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire
protection assessment;
c. The number of units contained within the parcel;
d. The total amount of the fire protection assessment imposed against the parcel for the
appropriate period;
e. The location at which payment will be accepted;
f. The date on which the fire protection assessment is due; and
g. A statement that the fire protection assessment constitutes a lien against assessed
property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or
municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments.
(2) The city commission shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire
protection assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages
on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection
proceedings. A fire protection assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within
thirty (30) days from the date payment was due, as identified in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this section. The city commission or its agent shall notify any property
owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her fire protection assessment within sixty
(60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the
city commission or its agent will either:
a . Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such
property subject to a delinquent fire protection assessment in a method now or
hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or
b . Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire protection assessment, not
previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year.
16/18
(3 ) All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search
expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any
judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action,
the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city commission or its
agent may join in one (1) foreclosure action the collection of fire protection assessments
against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All
delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned

commission identifying outstanding special assessments owed to the city for municipal
abatement of nuisances and municipal correction of violations of the minimum property
maintenance standards of the city, including municipal demolition of one (1) or more
structures, and seeking authorization to collect such special assessments as non-ad valorem
property tax pursuant to F.S. ch. 197. The proposed resolution shall designate the name
and address of the owner, a description of the lots or land and the charges to be assessed
against such lots or land for abatement or corrective activity. If prepared, the resolution
shall be presented to the city commission by the code official and, upon approval of the
resolution by the city commission, outstanding charges shall be assessed against the
property and shall be and remain a lien against such property prior to all other liens or
interests, save and except taxes, and shall bear interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per
annum from the date the resolution is approved by the city commission.
(b) Before adoption of the resolution specified in paragraph (a), the city commission shall
cause to be published a notice directed to the owner(s) of the subject property, designating
a time and place where complaints will be heard with reference to the proposed assessment
and when such assessment will be finally approved and confirmed by the city commission.
A copy of such notice shall be served upon the property owner(s) by first class U.S. Mail at
the owner's last known address as same appears on the records of the property appraiser of
the county. The failure to mail such notice or notices shall not invalidate any of the
proceedings under this article.
(c) At the time and place designated in the notice provided in paragraph (b), the city
commission shall meet as an equalizing board to hear and consider any and all complaints
as to such assessment and shall adjust and equalize the assessment, and when so equalized
and approved and the resolution specified in paragraph (a) adopted, such assessment shall
stand confirmed and be and remain a legal, valid and binding lien upon the property against
which such assessment is made until paid.
(d) To the extent not inconsistent with general or special law, special assessment liens
created and perfected pursuant to the provisions set forth herein and unrecorded at the time
of the filing for record of a notice of lis pendens against the subject property shall
nonetheless be enforceable against the subject property and shall have the priority specified
herein if the city's interest or lien did not arise until after the filing for record of such
notice of lis pendens.
(e) Only special assessments which may become a lien against homestead as permitted by
Section 4, Art. X of the State Constitution may be collected using the alternative method
described herein, if the property in question is entitled to homestead protection.

buildings or structures that are designated as historic by the National Park Service and listed on
the National Register of Historic Places when such buildings or structures are judged by the
Code Official to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety, and welfare.
12-227.6 Referenced codes and standards. The codes and standards referenced throughout this
code shall be considered part of this code and are accordingly adopted and incorporated herein

12-227.7 Requirements not covered by code. Requirements necessary for the strength, stability
or proper operation of an existing fixture, structure or equipment, or for the public safety,
health, and general welfare, not specifically covered by this code shall be determined by the
Code Official using the following:

g. Reference to any other suitably acceptable source of custom or practice reasonably
accepted by society and sufficiently reliable in nature such that the requirement would be
generally known and accepted in the community.
h. Any amendment to each of the aforementioned codes or other provisions of law shall include

along with the first notice a written determination including the basis for requirement and the
necessary steps to correct the deficiency observed to meet the requirement.
12-227.8 Code Officials. Each Code Enforcement Officer and Building Official of the City is
deemed a "Code Official" for purposes of this code. A code official may only exercise

required to be delivered to the Code Official under this code shall be delivered to the
responsible Code Official for the case.
12-227.9 Liability. In accordance with § 768.28(9)(a), Florida Statutes, a City official or

27/45
§ 12-229. Duties and powers of the code official
Effective: Tuesday, January 19, 2016
12-229.1 Inspections. The code official shall make all of the required inspections, or shall
accept reports of inspection by approved agencies or individuals. All reports of such
inspections shall be in writing and be certified by a responsible officer of such approved
agency or by the responsible individual. The code official is authorized to engage such expert
opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that arise, subject to the
approval of the appointing authority.
12-229.2 Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions
of this code, or whenever the code official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in a
structure or upon a premises a condition in violation of this code, the code official is
authorized to enter the structure or premises at reasonable times to inspect or perform the duties
imposed by this code, provided that if such structure or premises is occupied the code official
shall present credentials to the occupant and request entry. If such structure or premises is
unoccupied, the code official shall first make reasonable effort to locate the owner or other
person having charge or control of the structure or premises and request entry. If entry is

retained in the official records as long as the building or structure to which such records relate
remains in existence, unless otherwise provided for by other regulations.
12-229.6 Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying out the
provisions of this code, the Building Official shall have the authority to grant modifications to
structures for individual cases as may be deemed necessary in his or her discretion. Should a
modification be denied, the requester may appeal the Building Official's decision to the Board
of Adjustment and Appeals. No modification from the terms of this code shall be issued unless
the Board of Adjustment and Appeals finds, based on competent substantial written evidence
submitted to the Planning & Development Department at least seven (7) business days before
the day of the scheduled meeting of the Board of Adjustment and Appeals, that all of the
following conditions are met:
a. The requested modification is in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code;
b. The requested modification does not lessen health, life, safety and fire requirements;
c. The circumstances giving rise to the requested modification are peculiar to the structure
and do not arise from the actions of a structure owner or occupant;
d. The requested modification, if approved, will not confer any special privilege that is
denied by the provisions of this code to other similarly situated structures;
e. Literal interpretation of the provisions of this code would deprive the structure owner or
occupant of rights commonly enjoyed by other similarly situated structures; and
f. The requested modification, if approved, is the minimum modification that will allow
reasonable use of the structure.
28/45
All requests for modifications must be submitted to the City in writing. It is the requester's
responsibility to include a proper mailing address with the written request for modification.
While it is preferred that the requester provide evidence supporting the modification to the
Board of Adjustment and Appeals at the time of making the written request, to ensure that the
requester is given adequate opportunity to provide the Board of Adjustment and Appeals with
all relevant evidence, the Planning & Development Director shall, upon receipt of a request for
modification, forward a notice, along with a copy of this Section, to the address supplied by the
requester that identifies the Board meeting date and the deadline for document submittal.
Should a modification to this code be approved, the Board of Adjustment and Appeals shall
draft a modification order and shall forward a copy of the modification order to the Code
Official for placement in the Code Official's files and a copy of the modification order to the
Building Official for placement in the Building Official's files.
Modifications to this code granted by the Board of Adjustment and Appeals are not variances
and do not run with the land, and upon the application for a building permit from the City for
the subject building, structure or premises by the owner or occupant thereof, such modifications
shall cease to be in existence and the subject building, structure or premises must be brought
into compliance with this code as a condition of issuance of the permit.
Any aggrieved person adversely affected by a decision of the Board of Adjustment and
Appeals made pursuant to this Section shall, within thirty (30) days of rendition of the decision,
make appeal to an applicable Court of law in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate
Procedure by filing with such Court a petition for writ of certiorari. Such an appeal shall be in
the nature of that from a final administrative decision.

intended to prevent the installation of any material or to prohibit any method of construction not
specifically prescribed by this code, provided that any such alternative has been approved. An
alternative material or method of construction shall be approved where the code official finds
that the proposed design is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of this
code, and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose intended, at least the
equivalent of that prescribed in this code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability and safety.
12-229.8 Required testing. Whenever there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the
provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or method does not conform to the
requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate claims for alternative materials or
methods, the code official shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to require tests to be
made as evidence of compliance at the property owner's expense.
12-229.9 Used material and equipment. The use of used materials which meet the
requirements of this code for new materials is permitted. Materials, equipment and devices
shall not be reused unless such elements are in good repair or have been reconditioned and
tested when necessary, placed in good and proper working condition and approved by the code
official.

§ 12-230. Unsafe structures and equipment
29/45
Effective: Wednesday, September 19, 2018
When a structure or equipment is found by the code official to be unsafe, or when a structure is
found unfit for human occupancy, or is found unlawful, such structure shall be placarded
pursuant to the provisions of this code.
§12-230.1 Unsafe structures. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be dangerous to the
life, health, property or safety of the public or the occupants of the structure by not providing
minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of fire, or because such structure
contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe or of
such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or complete collapse is possible.
§12-230.2 Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating equipment,
elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable liquid containers or other
equipment on the premises or within the structure which is in such disrepair or condition that
such equipment is a hazard to life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the
premises or structure.
§12-230.3 Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for human occupancy
whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful or, because of the
degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is insanitary, vermin or rat
infested, contains filth and contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the location of the
structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the structure or to the public.
§12-230.4 Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in part to be
occupied by more persons than permitted under this code, or was erected, altered or occupied
contrary to law.
§12-230.5 Dangerous structure or premises. For the purpose of this code, any structure or
premises that has any or all of the conditions or defects described below shall be considered
dangerous.
a. Any door, aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress that does not conform
to the requirements for existing buildings identified in Chapter 553, Florida Statutes, the
Florida Building Code, the Florida Fire Prevention Code or the Florida Life Safety Code.
b. The walking surface of any aisle, passageway, stairway, exit or other means of egress is so
warped worn loose, torn or otherwise unsafe as to not provide safe and adequate means of
egress.
c. Any portion of a building, structure or appurtenance that has been damaged by fire,
earthquake, wind, flood, deterioration, neglect, abandonment, vandalism or by any other
cause to such an extent that it is likely to partially or completely collapse, or to become
detached or dislodged.
d. Any portion of a building, or any member, appurtenance or ornamentation on the exterior
thereof that is not of sufficient strength or stability, or is not so anchored, attached or fastened
in place so as to be capable of resisting natural or artificial loads of one and one-half the
original designed value.
e. The building or structure, or part of the building or structure, because of dilapidation,
deterioration, decay, faulty construction, the removal or movement of some portion of the
ground necessary for the support, or for any other reason, is likely to partially or completely
collapse, or some portion of the foundation or underpinning of the building or structure is
likely to fail or give way.
30/45
f. The building or structure, or any portion thereof, is clearly unsafe for its use and
occupancy.
g. The building or structure is neglected, damaged, dilapidated, unsecured or abandoned so
as to become an attractive nuisance to children who might play in the building or structure to
their danger, becomes a harbor for vagrants, criminals or immoral persons, or enables
persons to resort to the building or structure for committing a nuisance or an unlawful act.
h. Any building or structure has been constructed, exists or is maintained in violation of any
specific requirement or prohibition applicable to such building or structure provided by the
approved building or fire code of the jurisdiction, or of any law or ordinance to such an
extent as to present either a substantial risk of fire, building collapse or any other threat to
life and safety.
i. A building or structure, used or intended to be used for dwelling purposes, because of
inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement,
inadequate light, ventilation, mechanical or plumbing system, or otherwise, is determined by
the code official to be unsanitary, unfit for habitation or in such a condition that is likely to
cause sickness or disease.
j. Any building or structure, because of lack of sufficient or proper fire-resistance-related
construction, fire protection systems, electrical system, fuel connections, mechanical system,
plumbing system or other cause, is determined by the code official to be a threat to life or
health.
k. Any portion of a building remains on a site after the demolition or destruction of the
building or structure or whenever any building or structure is abandoned so as to constitute
such building or portion thereof as an attractive nuisance or hazard to the public.
§12-230.6 Closing of structures. If a structure is unfit for human habitation and occupancy,
and is not in danger for structural collapse, but is open such that the interior of the structure is
easily accessible through open or broken windows, open or broken doors, or missing structural
elements, the Code Official is authorized to issue a demand for correction in accordance with
Sec. 12-211 of this code.
Alternatively, should the structure
(1) pose an imminent danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the general public;
(2) be occupied periodically by transients or itinerants; or
(3) be utilized for illegal conduct in violation of any federal, state or local law,
The Code Official is authorized to have the structure immediately closed up so as not to be an
attractive nuisance by posting a notice at each entrance to the building and by sealing each
accessible entrance.
31/45
When the Code Official elects to post a "notice " on a structure at each accessible entrance, in
accordance with subsection (1), (2) or (3) above, the Code Official shall send a bill for the
City's expense in closing the structure to the owner of the property underlying the structure or
the agent of such owner of the property underlying the structure by United States certified mail,
return receipt requested. Should the City's bill be returned unclaimed, the City may then post
the bill on the closed structure and at a conspicuous location at City Hall for ten (10) days,
which, on the tenth day after posting, shall constitute the equivalent of delivery. After billing by
the City, if the full amount due the City is not paid by the owner of the structure or the agent of
the owner of the structure within thirty (30) days after receipt of the bill or after the expiration
of ten (10) days after posting the bill, the Code Official shall cause to be recorded in the public
records of the county, a sworn statement showing the cost and expense incurred for the work
and the date, place and property on which such work was done, and an affidavit of constructive
service by posting, if any, and the recordation of such sworn statement shall constitute a special
assessment lien on the property equivalent to the lien of municipal taxes and taking precedence
over all other recorded liens, and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due on
principal and interest, plus costs of court, if any, for collection, until final payment has been
made. Such special assessment lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided for by general
law.
Any owner aggrieved by the findings and order of the Code Official shall have the right to
appeal said decision prior to the expiration of the time within which to pay the bill for closing
the structure due the City. Any appeal taken must be requested, in writing, and timely received
by the City Clerk at 201 West Central Avenue, Lake Wales, Florida. In the event the time for
owner to pay expires on a weekend, evening or a holiday, the owner shall have until 5:00 p.m.
the next business day to file the request for appeal. Such written notice or request may be in any
form which clearly notifies the City of the owner's request. The Code Official shall place the
appeal on the agenda of the next scheduled Code Enforcement Board Hearing or may request a
special meeting to hear the appeal. Any appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance with
the action appealed from until after the hearing is held. It shall be the responsibility of the
owner of the property in question to show that the City's actions are without reason. The Code
Enforcement Board shall determine whether the appeal is justified. The appeal hearing shall be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 162, Florida Statutes. If it is
determined by the Code Enforcement Board, based on competent substantial evidence in the
record, that the City's actions are without reason, the cost for closing the structure shall be
borne by the City.
No structure closed by the City pursuant to this section may be reopened unless said structure is
wholly compliant with this code or unless it is shown during a timely appeal after hearing that
the City's actions in closing the structure were without reason.
§12-230.6.1 Authority to disconnect service utilities. The code official shall have the
authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system
regulated by this code and the referenced codes and standards set forth in Section 12-227.6 in
case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property or
when such utility connection has been made without approval. The code official shall notify
the serving utility and, whenever possible, the owner and occupant of the building, structure
or service system of the decision to disconnect prior to taking such action. If not notified
prior to the disconnection the owner or occupant of the building, structure, or service system
shall be notified in writing as soon as practical thereafter.
32/45
§12-230.7 Notice. Whenever the Building Official has reason to condemn a structure or
equipment under the provisions of this section, a notice of violation shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on or about the structure affected by such notice and served on the owners of
land, the agent of such owners, or the person or persons responsible for the structure or
equipment by United States certified mail, return receipt requested. If the notice pertains to
equipment, it shall also be placed on the equipment in violation. The notice shall specify a
reasonable time in which the structure or equipment owner or the person or persons
responsible for the structure or equipment shall abate the condition and bring such structure or
equipment into compliance.
§12-230.8 Placarding. Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply with the
notice provisions within the time given, the Code Official shall post on the premises or on
defective equipment a placard which includes a statement of the penalties provided for
occupying the premises, operating the equipment or removing the placard.
§12-230.8.1 Placard removal. The code official shall remove the placard whenever the
defect or defects upon which the placarding action were based have been eliminated. Any
person who defaces or removes a placard without the approval of the code official shall be
subject to the penalties provided by this code.
§12-230.9 Prohibited occupancy. Any structure placarded by a Code Official shall be vacated
as ordered by the Code Official. Any person who shall occupy a placarded premises or shall
operate placarded equipment, and any owner, agent of such owner, or any person responsible
for the premises who shall let anyone occupy a placarded premises or operate placarded
equipment shall be subject to the penalties of this section.
§12-230.10 Abatement methods. The owner, operator or occupant of a building, premises or
equipment deemed unsafe by the code official shall abate or cause to be abated or corrected
such unsafe conditions either by repair, rehabilitation, demolition or other approved corrective
action.
§12-230.11 Record. The code official shall cause a report to be filed on an unsafe condition.
The report shall state the occupancy of the structure and the nature of the unsafe condition.
§12-230.12 Boarded up structures. No structure may be boarded up by its owner for a period
of time exceeding one hundred twenty (120) days unless:
(1) the owner is granted a written waiver signed by the Building Official and the Code
Official; or
(2) the structure has been closed in accordance with Sec. 12-230.6 of this code.
All structures shall be maintained in accordance with Sec. 12.235.6 of this code ("Exterior
walls"), and all materials used to enclose the building must be neatly fitted within window and
door openings and must be painted to blend in with the rest of the building. Closing a structure
in accordance with Sec.12-230.6 of this code does not relieve the owner from complying with

§ 15-10. Drug and prostitution-related nuisance abatement. [Repealed]
Effective: Tuesday, February 07, 2017
This section shall be known as and may be cited as the Lake Wales Drug and Prostitution-
Related Nuisance Abatement Ordinance.
The City Commission of the City of Lake Wales does hereby find that the illegal
cultivation, delivery, manufacture and sale of a controlled substance or the possession of a
controlled substance where the possession constitutes a felony or a violation of F.S. §
796.07, is a threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Lake Wales.
9/15
A pattern of illegal conduct often arises and is associated with certain places or premises
within the city where the illegal cultivation, delivery, manufacture and sale of a controlled
substance or the possession of a controlled substance where the possession constitutes a
felony or a violation of F.S. § 796.07, occurs.
A pattern of drug and prostitution-related activity associated with a place or premises
within the city serves to encourage future illegal drug and prostitution-related activity on
or about these particular places or premises. Such drug and prostitution-related illegal
activity is injurious to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Lake Wales and
corrupts the public morals.
It is necessary in order to provide an expeditious and effective method of removing illegal
drug and prostitution-related activity that a drug and prostitution-related nuisance
abatement board be created pursuant to F.S. § 893.138.
Whenever in this section the following terms are used, they shall have the meanings
ascribed as follows:
(a) Board: The drug and prostitution-related nuisance abatement board as created herein.
(b) City commission or commission: The Lake Wales City Commission.

masturbation; however, the term does not include acts does for bona fide medical
purposes.
There is hereby created a board of this city which shall be known as the Lake Wales Drug
and Prostitution-Related Nuisance Abatement Board. The board shall have the power to:
(a) Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings and establish procedure;

annually and elect a chair, who shall be a voting member, from among the members of the
board. The presence of four (4) or more members shall constitute a quorum.

provided by law.
The city attorney shall serve as legal counsel for the board and shall assist the board in

manufacture or sale of a controlled substance, or the possession of a controlled substance
where the possession constitutes a felony or a violation of F.S. § 796.07, has occurred on
more than two (2) occasions within a six-month period.
The drug and prostitution-related nuisance abatement board shall hear complaints and may
declare any place or premises a public nuisance that tends to annoy the community or is a
threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Lake Wales.
Any code enforcement officer, employee, law enforcement officer or resident of the City of
Lake Wales may bring a complaint before the board. Such complaint shall be in writing and
filed with the secretary to the board. Upon receipt of said complaint, the secretary shall
notify the chair, who shall call a hearing of the board within twenty-one (21) days
following the receipt of the complaint.
Notice of said complaint shall be furnished to the owner of the place or premises at his or
her last known address in writing or by personal service not less than seven (7) days prior

order.
11/15

injunction against any nuisance. The city attorney, or his or her designee, shall prosecute
such action on behalf of the board.

§ 15-11. Sexual offenders.
This section shall be known as and may be cited as the Lake Wales Sexual Offenders
Ordinance.
The City Commission of the City of Lake Wales does hereby find that repeat sexual
offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on
children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual
offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses and
most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims that are never
reported and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. The cost of sexual offender
victimization to society at large is clearly exorbitant.
The City of Lake Wales intends for this section to serve the city's compelling interest to
promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the children and citizens of
the City of Lake Wales by creating areas around locations where children regularly
congregate in concentrated numbers wherein sexual offenders are prohibited from
establishing temporary or permanent residence.
Whenever in this section the following terms are used, they shall have the meanings
ascribed as follows:
(a) Permanent residence: A place where a person abides, lodges, or resides for fourteen
(14) or more consecutive days, or for more than sixty (60) days within any one (1) year
interval, whether or not consecutive.
(b) Sexual offender: Any person who has been convicted of or entered a plea of guilty to
a violation of F.S. § 794.011, § 800.04, § 827.071, or § 847.0145, in which the victim
of the offense was less than sixteen (16) years of age at the time the offense was
committed, whether or not adjudication of guilt was withheld, and shall also include any
person who has been convicted of or entered a plea of guilty to a violation of any statute
in any other state or territory of the United States of America, which proscribes
substantially the same behavior as those Florida Statutes referenced above, whether or
not adjudication of guilt was withheld.
(c) Temporary residence: A place where the person abides, lodges or resides for a period
of fourteen (14) or more days in the aggregate during any calendar year and which is not
the person's permanent residence, or the place where the person routinely abides, lodges,
or resides for a period of four (4) or more consecutive or non-consecutive days in any
month and which is not the person's permanent residence.
12/15
It is unlawful for any sexual offender to establish a permanent residence or a temporary
residence in the City of Lake Wales within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of any
church, daycare center, public library, public park or public playground, public school bus
stop, or school located outside the municipal limits of the City of Lake Wales but within
two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of a residence located within those municipal
limits. It shall also be unlawful for any owner of a residential real property knowingly to
lease or rent to a sexual offender who intends to establish a permanent or temporary
residence within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of church, daycare center, public
library, public park or public playground, public school bus stop, or school, or knowingly
to permit any sexual offender to establish a temporary or permanent residence within two
thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of any church, daycare center, public library, public
park or public playground, public school bus stop, or school, as a member of the
household of the owner's named tenant(s).
For purposes of determining the minimum distance separation, the requirement shall be
measured by following a straight line from the outer property line of the permanent
residence or temporary residence to the nearest outer property line of a church, daycare
center, public library, public park or public playground, public school bus stop, or school.
The city may pursue any civil and criminal enforcement action or legal remedy available
under controlling state law, including but not limited to injunctive relief. If injunctive
relief or other civil judicial relief is sought, the city shall be entitled to recover its
reasonable attorneys' fees from the defendant. A person who violates this section shall be
punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or by imprisonment for a
term not exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both; for a second or subsequent conviction of a
violation of this section, said person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one (1) year, or by both. In
the alternative, the city may seek enforcement by way of its municipal code enforcement
process. This remedy shall be supplemental to and not in derogation of any other remedies.
A person having a permanent residence within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of
church, daycare center, public library, public park or public playground, public school bus
stop, or school does not commit a violation of this section if any of the following apply:

school bus stop or school within two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet of the person's
permanent residence was established after the person established permanent residence;

offense that causes the person to fall within the definition of a sexual offender under this
section, whichever is later;
(c) The person is a minor;
(d) The person was a minor when he or she committed the offense and was not sentenced
as an adult.

ski within two hundred (200) feet of the Lake Wailes Pier.
13/15

(30) days from the date a citation was issued a civil penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) to the
police department in full satisfaction of the violation. If the person chooses to contest the

CHAPTER 16. PENSIONS AND RETIREMENT
Article I. In General
Article II. City Of Lake Wales General Employees' Pension Plan And Trust
Division 1. Generally
Division 2. Ordinance 99-02 General Employees' Pension Plan
§ 16-41. Definitions and rules of construction.
Effective: Tuesday, January 20, 2015
(a) As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following
words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated:
Accrued benefit means the benefit accrued by a member under the terms of the plan.
Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For
those members who purchase credited service with interest and at no cost to the system,
any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the
applicable member contribution rate, interest and any required actuarially calculated
payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated
contributions.
Act means the Employee Retirement income Security Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-406) and any
regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue
Service, as that statute and these regulations shall be amended.
Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the 1983
Group Annuity Mortality Table and an interest rate of eight (8) percent per annum.
Average annual compensation shall mean the average compensation received by a general
employee during the period of five (5) consecutive calendar years which produces the
highest average annual compensation. For an employee who does not receive
compensation during five (5) consecutive calendar years, "average annual compensation"
shall mean the average of the actual annual compensation received by the general
employee.
Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death
of a member as provided in section 16-49 of the plan.
Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein
provided and serve as trustees of the fund.
City means City of Lake Wales, Florida.
Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
5/130
Compensation shall mean the total amount of all payments made by the city to an
employee for services rendered to the city, including overtime pay and an employee's
contributions to this plan. Compensation shall not include employee expense
reimbursements, director's fees, contributions made by the city under the plan, nor
contributions made by the city for group insurance, hospitalization and like benefits nor,
except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence, contributions made by the city
under any other employee benefit plan it maintains. Notwithstanding the preceding, for
computation periods ending prior to the effective date of Ordinance 88-19,
"compensation" shall mean amounts paid to the employee by the city which were
considered to be "earnings" pursuant to the city general employees' pension plan as the plan
existed immediately prior to the effective date of Ordinance 88-19.
Compensation shall exclude the following: (1) overtime in excess of 300 hours and (2)
accrued unused annual or sick leave ("accumulated leave") in excess of the hours accrued
as of June 30, 2011 (hereinafter the "effective date"). The number of hours of accumulated
leave used to calculate pension benefits shall be the lesser of the number of hours of
accumulated leave on the effective date and the member's retirement date. For purposes of
valuing accumulated leave earned prior to July 1, 2011: (i) compensation shall exclude
accumulated leave hours in excess of the balance on June 30, 2011; (ii) accumulated leave
balances shall be calculated using the future value of accumulated leave upon retirement;
and (iii) the member's final accumulated leave balance accrued as of June 30, 2011 upon
retirement shall be pensionable, notwithstanding the fluctuation of intervening
accumulated leave balances after June 30, 2011. The intent of this amendment is to protect
accrued benefits, consistent with Article I, Section 10 of the Florida Constitution.
Amounts which are paid to reimburse an employee for unused vacation and sick time shall
be considered to be compensation which is earned during the calendar year in which such
payment is made. Amounts which are paid to a former member as severance pay shall be
considered to be compensation, but such amounts shall be considered to have been earned
and paid in equal weekly increments over the period of time following the member's
termination of service for which the severance pay was based, and shall be compensation in
a particular calendar year only to the extent that it is considered to have been paid in that
calendar year.
Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in Code section 401(a)(17) shall be
disregarded. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less
than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July
1, 1993.
Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as
a general employee with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years
or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a general
employee. A member may voluntarily leave their contribution in the fund for a period of
five (5) years after leaving the employ of the city pending the possibility of being rehired
without losing credit for the time that he or she was a member of the system. If the member
is not reemployed within five (5) years, then the accumulated contributions will be
returned upon written request of the member. Upon return of a member's accumulated
contributions, all of their rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated.
Returned contributions will be credited with interest as provided in section 16-46.
6/130
In the event that a member of this system has also accumulated credited service in another
pension system maintained by the city, or has a period or periods of previous employment
as a general employee, but is not eligible to receive credited service for this period or
periods of previous employment for benefit calculation purposes, then such other credited
service shall be used in determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such other
credited service will not, however, be considered in determining benefits under this system.
Unless otherwise provided herein only the member's credited service and compensation
under this system on or after the member's latest date of membership in this system will be
considered for benefit calculation. In addition, any benefit calculation for a member of this
system who is or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he or she has
become a member of another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based upon
the member's average final compensation, credited service and benefit accrual rate as of the
date the member ceases to be a general employee.
The years or fractional parts of years that a general employee previously served as a general
employee with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period
accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or for a period of previous
employment for which credited service has not been otherwise received for benefit
calculation purposes, shall be added to the member's years of credited service provided
that:
(1) The general employee contributes to the fund the sum that he or she would have
contributed had he or she been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of
years for which he or she is requesting credit, plus amounts actuarially determined such
that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund, plus payment of costs
for all professional services and administrative costs rendered to the board in connection
with the purchase of years of credited service.
(2) The request shall be made only once and made by the general employee on or before
the later of twelve (12) months from the effective date of this ordinance or six (6)
months from the date of the member's reemployment with the city as a general employee,
whichever is later.
(3) Payment by the general employee of the required amount shall be made within six (6)
months of the member's request for credit and shall be made in one (1) lump sum
payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given.
(4) There shall be no maximum credit under this definition and all years of credited
service added pursuant to this definition shall count for all purposes.
Years and completed months of employment with the city during which time the member is
participating in the deferred retirement option plan (DROP) described in section 16-46(j),
shall not be counted as credited services for benefit purposes unless the member elects to
continue employment with the city following the completion of the two (2) year DROP
period. In the event of continued employment following participation in the DROP
program, the member will receive credit for the DROP period in accordance with the
required repurchase procedure set forth above.
Effective date means October 1, 1999, except as otherwise provided in the plan and except
where an earlier effective date is required by reason of the application of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, in which case the latest effective date required to
comply with such act and subsequent legislation shall be substituted with respect only to
the specific portions of the plan effected by such act and subsequent legislation.
7/130
Eligible employee is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning
after December 31, 1995.
Employee means general employee unless such term is used in a general sense.
Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system.
General employee means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of
the city, including those in their initial probationary employment period, but not including
police officers and firefighters, but shall include civilian, clerical and other employees of
the police and fire departments. A full time employee shall be deemed to be one whose
customary employment is for twenty (20) or more hours per week and five (5) or more
months per year.
General counsel means the attorney retained by the board to represent it with respect to the
plan.
Member means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed
membership requirements and does not elect to opt-out. Benefit improvements which, in
the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance,
and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively
and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the
effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance
specifically provides to the contrary. Member shall also include any opt-out employee
under section 16-42(c)(2) who elects to join the Plan and is determined by the board of
trustees to have fulfilled the requirements set forth in section 16-42(d).
Opt-out employee means an actively employed general employee employed in a position
defined as pay grades 202300, who elects to establish a qualified tax deferred pension
plan in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and rules as promulgated by the
Secretary of the Treasury, and receive benefits in accordance with section 16-42(c).
Plan means the City of Lake Wales General Employees' Pension Plan and Trust.
Plan year means the twelve (12) month period beginning October 1 and ending September
30, of the following year. The plan year shall be the computation period for the purposes
of the plan. The change in plan year shall be effective January 1, 1998.
Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status.
Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for
immediate receipt of retirement benefits under the system.
Spouse means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits
become payable.

(a) Conditions of eligibility. Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, all future new full
time employees shall become members of this system, as a condition of employment, on
the initial date of employment as a probationary employee. Each employee who was a
member in the plan pursuant to the terms of the plan as it existed immediately prior to the
effective date shall continue as a member in this plan as of the effective date. All present
employees as of the effective date that are not enrolled in the plan shall have the continuing
opportunity to become members upon submitting an application for membership.
(b) Application for membership. Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, each new full
time employee shall complete an application form covering the following, as well as such
other items as may be prescribed by the board:
(1) Acceptance of the terms and conditions of the retirement system;

(3) Authorization of payroll deduction payable to the system.
(c) Participation, election to opt out.
(1) All full time employees shall participate in the plan as a condition of their
employment, except for employees who serve in opt-out positions who may make an
irrevocable election to opt-out of the plan. Opt-out positions are defined as pay grades
119(a)300.
(2) Employees eligible to opt-out shall be given notice and an opportunity to elect out of
the plan from October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999. Employees who are hired or
promoted to opt-out positions after the initial opt-out election period expires shall be
given the option to opt-out of the plan at the time they are hired or first promoted to an
opt-out position. All elections are irrevocable, except as provided in subsection 16-
42(d). An employee who elects to opt-out of the plan and establishes a qualified tax
deferred pension plan in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and rules as
promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be entitled to receive, via rollover,
direct plan to plan transfer, or other method, an amount equal to the electing employee's
member contributions, with simple interest thereon computed at the greater of five (5)
percent per annum, or such other rate which may at that time be in effect, plus an amount
equal to such employee's total compensation earned while a plan participant, multiplied
by the average percentage of city contributions to its general employees over the five (5)
year period immediately preceding the year in which the election is made. Participants
who receive a payout of their plan benefits after opting out will not be entitled to any
other benefits under the plan.
(3) An employee who elects to opt-out may choose to leave their funds in the plan in
which case the member shall be entitled to receive benefits under the plan in the same
manner as other members, except that such members shall cease accruing additional
credited service for benefit purposes and all determinations of compensation made under
the plan will be based upon compensation earned during the time the member
participated in the plan.
9/130
(4) An employee who elects to opt-out is eligible to establish a tax deferred pension plan
in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code and rules as promulgated by the Secretary
of the Treasury. In conjunction with the employee's remittance of an amount at least
equal to the contribution requirements as stated in section 16-45(a)(1) but not more than
the maximum deferral allowed by the Internal Revenue Code and treasury regulations, to
the deferral plan of their choosing, the city shall remit an amount equal to their gross biweekly
wages or salary times a percentage determined in the annual actuarial valuation
report prepared by the general employee's pension plan actuary, for city contributions to
the general employee's pension plan for participants. In the absence of adequate
individual remittances, the city is absolved of its responsibility to make contributions.
(d) Participation, written election to opt back into the Plan.
(1) All members who opted-out of the Plan pursuant to subsection 16-42(c)(2) and
remain employees of the city shall be provided an option to submit a one-time written
election to rejoin the Plan. Upon joining the Plan, the member shall be transferred from
the city's defined contribution plan into the General Employees' Pension Plan and Trust.
The board of trustees shall provide all applicable opt-out employees with a copy of the
ordinance permitting the election to opt into the Plan. The board of trustees shall have
the authority to adopt administrative rules and procedures to govern the opt-in procedure
to be uniformly applied to all applicable employees.
(2) Upon entry into the Plan, opt-out members shall have the option to purchase prior
creditable service with the city. The member shall be required to pay the full actuarial
cost of the prior service for any service purchased. The member shall also be required to
reimburse the Plan for the cost of the actuary's individual service buyback calculation.
Payment in full for the cost of the prior service buyback must be submitted within ninety
(90) days from the date the actuarially determined calculation is provided to the
employee. Payment may be made by rollover from another qualified plan. Members
electing to rejoin the Plan but not to purchase prior creditable service will be deemed to
have commenced credited service on the date of entry into the Plan.

services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under Investment Advisors
Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company,
or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such
investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the
board, in the investment of all fund assets.

consultant professionally qualified to evaluate the performance of professional money
managers. The board may engage an independent consultant in concert with the boards of
trustees for the firefighters' and police officers' pension trust funds and share the costs
with these boards. The independent consultant shall make recommendations to the board
of trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term.
These recommendations shall be considered by the board of trustees at its next regularly
scheduled meeting. The date, time, place and subject of this meeting shall be advertised
in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least ten (10) days prior to
the date of the hearings.

provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets
of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under the plan,
except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the
fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be
held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be
required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund.
(2) All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board
and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be limited to:
a . Annuity and life insurance contracts with life insurance companies in amounts
sufficient to provide, in whole or in part, the benefits to which all of the members in
the fund shall be entitled under the provisions of this plan and pay the initial and
subsequent premium thereon.

States, or the District of Columbia, provided that the security of the corporation is
traded an a nationally recognized exchange and holds a rating or ranking in one (1) of
the three (3) highest classifications by a major rating or ranking service, and if such
investments are made in a commingled fund administered by a state or national bank,
then the rating or ranking of each issue in the commingled fund shall hold a rating or

in any one (1) issuing company exceed five (5) percent of the outstanding capital stock of
that company.

fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the plan.
(5) The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or

it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and
records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund.
(6) The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or
securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies
or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers,
reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect
to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any
protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to
amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the
acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an
owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it
may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise.
(7) The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any
court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein.
(8) Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it
is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable
to it as trustee under this ordinance, can reasonably be taken or performed only after
receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information,
certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take
such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification,
direction or instruction has been received by it.
16/130
( 9 ) Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or
beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per
annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit
to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to, shall be paid.

collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in
a prudent manner.
(10) The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to
meet the payments and benefits herein provided for.
(11) In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, any judgment entered in
such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons.
(12) Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed
or carried out by the board through duty authorized agents, provided that the board at all
times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further,
that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.
(g) The board of trustees shall not have any obligation or responsibility with respect to any
action required by the plan to be taken by the city or, any member, nor shall the board of
trustees be required to collect any contribution required under the plan, or determine the
correctness of the amount of any contribution. The board of trustees need not inquire into
or be responsible for any action or failure to act on the part of the others.
(h) The board of trustees and the city in no way guarantee the trust fund from loss or
depreciation. The city does not guarantee the payment of any money which may be or
becomes due to any person from the fund. The liability of the board of trustees to make any
payment from the fund at any time and all times is limited to the then available assets of the
fund.
(i) The board shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any investment manager or
managers the board of trustees may appoint, nor shall the board be under any obligation to

investment manager may execute a letter of agreement as a part of this plan delineating the
duties, responsibilities and liabilities of the investment manager with respect to any part of
the trust fund under the control of the investment manager.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 3, 4-2-12)
§ 16-45. Contributions.
(a) Member contributions.
(1) Amount. Each member of the plan shall be required to make regular contributions to
the fund in the amount of five (5) percent of their compensation. Member contributions
withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board at least
monthly. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as
employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is
contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for
federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the plan, such contributions shall
be considered to be member contributions. Member contributions shall cease if a
member's accrued benefit reaches the seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) cap set
forth in section 16-46
17/130
(2) Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction.
(b) City contributions. So long as this plan is in effect, the city shall make an annual
contribution to the fund in one (1) or more installments in an amount equal to the
difference in each year, between the total aggregate member contributions for the year and
the total cost for the year, in a manner which is authorized under the provision of F.S. part
VII ch. 112, or its successor. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal
cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded accrued past service
liability over a thirty (30) year period, commencing with the fiscal year in which the initial
effective date of this plan occurs. The city, from its records and the reports of the actuary,
shall determine the amount of any contributions to be made by it to fund under the terms of
the plan. In this regard, the city may place full reliance upon all reports, opinions, tables,
valuations, certificates and computations the actuary furnishes the city.
(c) Other contributions. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the
fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated
bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional
benefits for members, as determined by the board of trustees, and may not be used to
reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.
(d) Return of overpayment member or beneficiary. Any overpayments or underpayments
from the fund to a member or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be
adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board. Overpayments shall be
charged against payments next succeeding the correction. Underpayments shall be made up
from the fund.
(e) Rollover contributions. The plan does not permit participant rollover contributions, or
voluntary contributions other than the mandatory contribution required pursuant to the
plan.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2003-39, § 2, 12-2-03; Ord. No. 2013-14, § 1, 9-
17-13)
§ 16-46. Benefit amounts and eligibility.
Effective: Tuesday, November 17, 2015
(a) Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the
month coincident with, or next following the date he or she attains the earlier of:
(1) Age sixty (60) years with ten (10) years of credited service; or
(2) The later of sixty (60) years or ten (10) years of credited service.
A member may retire on their normal retirement date or on the first day of any month
thereafter. Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from employment with the
city on or after the normal retirement date. Each member who retires on or after
normal retirement age shall receive a normal retirement pension.
18/130
(b) Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after their normal
retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit consisting of a single life annuity which
shall commence on the first day of the month next following their retirement and be
continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death. The monthly retirement
benefit shall equal one-twelfth (1/12) of two and one-half (2½) percent of average annual
compensation, for each year of credited service. For members retiring before the effective
date of this plan, the benefit defined by the plan as it was stated at that time shall be
payable. Retirement income will be reduced for moneys received under the disability
provisions of the plan so that the monthly benefit shall not exceed the greater of the
disability or retirement pension. Effective October 1, 2012, annual defined benefits under
this section may not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000.00) per year.
( c ) Delayed retirement. Retirement may be delayed by a member and shall not be
mandatory solely by reason of age prior to the required beginning date specified in section
16-54, hereof. Subject to the provisions of section 16-54, the delayed retirement date shall
be the first day of the month coincident with, or next following, actual retirement.
(d) Early retirement date. A member may retire on their early retirement date which shall
be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fiftyfive
(55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under
the plan is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date
and prior to the normal retirement date.
(e) Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on their early retirement date
may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable for life as
follows:
(1) A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have
been the member's normal retirement date had the member remained an employee and
shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such
deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be a life-annuity determined in the same manner
as for retirement at normal retirement date except that credited service and average
annual compensation shall be determined as of his or the early retirement date; or
(2) An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on the member's
early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The
benefit payable shall be as determined above, reduced by one fifteenth (1/15) for each of
the first two and one-half (21/2;) years, one thirtieth (1/30) for each of the next two and
one-half (2½) years by which the commencement of benefits precedes the member's
normal retirement date.
(f) Immediate and deferred payment of early retirement benefit. The board of trustees
shall commence payment of the immediate early retirement pension on the first day of the
month designated by the member as the annuity starting date, so long as such date follows
the member's termination of service with the city. If a member elects a deferred early
retirement pension, or fails to designate an annuity starting date, the board shall commence
payment following the member's attainment of normal retirement age.
19/130
(g) Termination benefitGenerally. A member whose employment terminates for any
reason prior to becoming eligible for an early or normal retirement pension, shall receive
either a deferred pension, calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph (h) of this section
16-46 herein; or a refund benefit in an amount equal to the total contributions made by the
member to the plan, with simple interest computed thereon at the greater of five (5) percent
per annum, or such other rate as may be designated from time to time by the board. A
member shall only be entitled to a deferred pension if the member has at least ten (10)
years of credited service. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 16-46, a
member, at any time prior to the commencement of his normal retirement pension, his
early retirement pension or his deferred pension, may elect to receive a refund benefit in
lieu thereof.
(h) Amount of deferred pension. The member's deferred pension shall be a single life
annuity computed in the same manner as his early retirement pension if the member elects
to begin receiving his monthly pension before normal retirement or it shall be a single life
annuity computed in the same manner as his normal retirement pension if the member
elects to begin receiving his pension at normal retirement, with such benefits to be
determined as of the date on which his termination of employment occurs.
(i) Payment of deferred pension. A terminated member's deferred pension shall become
payable in the same manner as a normal retirement pension, or if elected by the member in
the manner provided in paragraph (h) hereof, in the same manner as an early retirement
pension.
(j) Deferred retirement option plan (DROP).
(1) Operation. Any member of the system who has satisfied the requirement for normal
or delayed retirement as set forth therein may elect to withdraw from the system while
continuing to be an employee of the city for a period of up to five (5) years. During this
period, the member would cease to make contributions to the fund and benefit accruals
would cease at the date of withdrawal. At the time of the withdrawal, the member may
elect an optional form of retirement income as described in section 16-48. The amount
of the monthly pension which would otherwise be paid shall be maintained in a special
DROP account in the name of the member within the fund and shall be segregated from
other trust assets on a bookkeeping basis. The member shall elect to receive either
interest or earnings on their account to be determined as provided below. The election
may be revised bi-annually on a prospective basis pursuant to such rules as the board of
trustees may adopt. DROP investment elections must be made in writing at least thirty
(30) days prior to the end of the December and June quarters, on such forms as the board
of trustees may require.
a. Interest election. The DROP account shall be credited interest based on the 91 T-Bill
interest rate compounded quarterly; or
b. Earnings election. Quarterly the DROP account shall share in the investment gains
and losses for the quarter at the same rate of the return earned by the total trust fund.
(2) Termination of employment. Upon termination of employment not later than five (5)
years following entry into the DROP program, the member shall commence receiving the
monthly benefit in the same form and amount as selected at the time of entry into the
DROP program. In addition, the member shall receive the value of this DROP Account
as a single lump sum.
20/130
(3) Continued employment. In the event that the member continues employment with the
city following completion of the five (5) year participation in the DROP plan, the
member shall forfeit their entitlement to the accumulated assets in the DROP Account
and shall deposit to the fund an amount equal to the member contribution which would
have been made had the member continued as an active participant in the plan during the
period of continued employment and shall contribute to the system at the rate specified
herein. Upon termination of employment, the retiring member shall receive benefit credit
for years and completed months during which he or she participated in the DROP
program and for which member contributions were subsequently made, as well as
credited service before and after participation in the DROP plan.
(k) Disability benefits:
I. Non-duty disability retirement:
(1) Each member with ten (10) years of credited service who becomes permanently and
totally incapacitated for further performance of duty with the city from a cause other
than the performance of duty shall be eligible for a non-duty disability retirement.
(2) A member shall be deemed disabled for the purposes of this section if permanently
and totally unable to engage in any useful and efficient service within the city
workforce due to a physical or mental impairment.
(3) No member may receive a non-duty disability retirement on the basis of a preexisting
medical condition, unless the disability would have occurred regardless of that
pre-existing condition. The board, as part of the disability review process, shall
determine whether a vacant position exists within the city's workforce, consistent with
the member's training, skill and medical limitations. If the member is capable of
performing any such vacant position and the member refuses the assignment, that
refusal shall be grounds for denial of a non-duty disability retirement. Nothing in this
section shall require the city to create a job where none presently exists or to accept an
employee who lacks the training or skills necessary to perform any such vacant
position.
(4) The procedure for determining disability shall be as set forth in this plan for the
determination of service-incurred disability.
(5) The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to require disabled members to
submit to a medical examination when the board has reason to believe that the disabled
member is committing a fraud on the fund.
(6) Non-duty disability benefits shall be calculated in the same manner as an early
retirement benefit (reduced by one-fifteenth (1/15) for each of the first two and onehalf
(2½) years, one-thirtieth (1/30) for each of the next two and one-half (2½) years
by which the commencement of benefits precedes the member's normal retirement
date). Non-duty disability benefits shall continue for the life of the member, except as
set forth in this section.
(7) Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled as defined in this Plan, non-duty
disability benefits shall cease. In such event, the member shall become eligible for a
regular service retirement, if the member otherwise satisfies the requirements for
service retirement.
21/130
(8) For the purposes of this section, compensation shall be deemed to be the greater of
the member's average compensation based upon the member's pay status at the time the
disabling event occurred or average annual compensation. The monthly benefit to
which a member is entitled shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the
board of trustees determines such entitlement. In lieu of the monthly disability pension,
the member may elect to receive a return of the member's contributions, with simple
interest thereon computed at the rate of five (5) percent per annum or such other rate,
which may be in effect at such time, in which event the member shall not be entitled to
any other benefit under the plan. A member receiving monthly disability benefits shall
not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan. In the event a member who is
receiving monthly disability benefits recovers, the last payment will be the payment due
next preceding the date of such recovery. Disability payments shall cease upon the
member's death.
II. Service-incurred disability retirement:
(1) A member shall be disabled under the terms of this section if the member has
suffered an injury or illness arising out of performance of service for the city and
which renders the member permanently and totally disabled for useful and efficient
service with the city.
(2) A member shall be deemed permanently and totally disabled when he or she is
totally unable to engage in any useful and efficient service within the city due to a
physical or mental impairment which is the natural and proximate result of an accident,
injury or illness which occurred while in the actual performance of duty.
(3) A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability retirement from the date
of entry into the plan. Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form
prescribed by the board of trustees. The member shall execute such medical releases as
are necessary to permit the board to review the medical records needed to determine the
question of disability and to discuss said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of
an application for a disability, the board shall refer the application to its physician for
review. The applicant for a disability shall be required to submit to such medical
examinations as the board appointed physician shall deem necessary. The board
appointed physician, and any referring specialists, shall report their findings to the
board. The report shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably possible, of
the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent and whether the
disability is total. In making those determinations, the physician(s) shall be bound by
the definition of disability set forth in this plan.
22/130
(4) Upon receipt of the report of the board's physician(s), the board of trustees shall
schedule a public hearing at which time the board shall review all medical reports,
together with such documentary evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The
board shall conduct a preliminary determination as to whether the member is
permanently and totally disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If
the board does not grant the application based on the written documentation, it shall
inform the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The
member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary denial,
request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing will be conducted
consistent with the principles of due process and the rules of evidence generally
applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply. The board shall have the power to
issue subpoenas compelling the attendance of witnesses. At said hearing, the applicant
may present such oral and written evidence as the applicant deems necessary to
establish its burden of proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to
cross-examine witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The
attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the board in
the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the right to examine and
cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board shall be based solely upon the
evidence presented and the law applicable to this plan. Following the conclusion of the
hearing, the board shall render an opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the
grant or denial of the benefit.
(5) The board may prescribe rules of procedure to implement the provisions of this
plan relating to the conduct of disability hearings.
(6) A member who is granted a service-incurred disability retirement shall receive a
benefit equal to the greater of: (i) forty-two (42) percent of average final
compensation; or (ii) the member's accrued benefit, subject to reduction for early
retirement (reduced by one-fifteenth (1/15) for each of the first two and one-half (2½)
years, one-thirtieth (1/30) for each of the next two and one-half (2½) years by which
the commencement of benefits precedes the member's normal retirement date). Serviceincurred
disability benefits shall continue for the life of the member, except as set forth
in this section. The benefit shall be paid yearly, in monthly installments, for the life of
the member.
(7) The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to require disabled members to
submit to a medical examination when the board has reason to believe that the disabled
member is no longer entitled to receive benefits from the fund. If the examination
reveals the member is no longer entitled to receive disability benefits, the benefits shall
cease and, if vested, the member will be eligible for a regular service retirement as if
hehad retired on the date his disability retirement benefits commenced. The board has
discretion to exercise this power as the circumstances warrant.
23/130
(8) For the purposes of this paragraph section, compensation shall be deemed to be the
greater of the member's average compensation based upon the member's pay status at
the time the disabling event occurred or average annual compensation. The monthly
benefit to which a member is entitled shall be payable on the first day of the first month
after the board of trustees determines such entitlement. In lieu of the monthly disability
pension, the member may elect to receive a return of the member's contributions, with
simple interest thereon computed at the rate of five (5) percent per annum or such
other rate, which may be in effect at such time, in which event the member shall not be
entitled to any other benefit under the plan. A member receiving monthly disability
benefits shall not be entitled to any other benefits under the plan. In the event a member
who is receiving monthly disability benefits recovers, the last payment will be the
payment due next preceding the date of such recovery.
(l) Effective date of change in benefits. Members separating from service before October
1, 1999, shall only be entitled to the benefits provided by the plan prior to October 1,
1999.
( m ) Member accrued benefit not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
Notwithstanding anything contained in this plan to the contrary, effective March 28,
2005 a member whose employment terminates for any reason other than death, with an
accrued benefit of less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will receive a lump sum
payment equal to the present value of member's accrued benefit, calculated based upon the
form of benefit for which the member qualifies (i.e., a deferred benefit versus a refund
benefit) which is most favorable to the member, without any requirement of member
consent. Such payment shall be in lieu of all other benefits under the plan.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2002-09, § 2, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2002-12, § 2, 7-
2-02; Ord. No. 2003-39, § 2, 12-2-03; Ord. No. 2007-38, § 1, 9-18-07; Ord. No. 2008-
06, § 2, 2-5-08; Ord. No. 2013-14, § 2, 9-17-13; Ord. No. 2015-14, § 1, 11-17-15)
§ 16-47. Pre-retirement death.
The beneficiary of a member who dies before receiving monthly benefits shall receive a
refund of one hundred (100) percent of the total contributions made by the member, with
simple interest thereon computed at the greater of five (5) percent per annum, or such other
rate as may be designated from time to time by the board. No other benefit shall be payable
under the circumstances described above.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99)
§ 16-48. Optional forms of benefits.
(a) In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal,
early, delayed retirement or deferred pension as specified herein, a member, upon written
request to the board, which request shall be retained by the board, may elect to receive a
retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one
(1) of the following options:
(1) A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the member for their
lifetime, with a ten (10) year term certain.
24/130
(2) A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member during
the lifetime of the member, and following the death of the member, one hundred (100)
percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (662/3) percent, or fifty (50)
percent of such monthly amounts payable to a joint pensioner for his or her lifetime.
Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is their spouse, the present value of payments
to the retiree shall not be less than fifty (50) percent of the total present value of
payments to the retiree and his or her joint pensioner.
(3) An actuarially equivalent larger monthly amount, with a reduction in the monthly
amount when the member's social security benefits are estimated to start so that the
member's total monthly benefit, inclusive of social security benefits, will remain
constant upon the starting date of his social security benefits.
(b) A retiree may not change their form of benefit after the date of cashing or depositing
their first retirement check. Notwithstanding the above, in the event a retiree becomes
divorced after receiving their first retirement check, such retiree may change their form of
benefit to a single life annuity as long as a certified copy of retiree's divorce decree does
not purport to provide any benefit to his or her ex-spouse, so long as such order does not
reserve jurisdiction to make such a provision for the surviving spouse and so long as the
retiree is alive at the time of the change and pays all costs associated with such change. All
changes shall be prospective and become effective only after the time of approval by the
board.
(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to
make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the
total computed value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the
power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a
complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with regard to such member and shall
not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
persons.
( d ) Actuarially equivalent pop-up option. Members shall be permitted to select an
actuarially equivalent pop-up option in conjunction with the joint and survivor annuity
contained in paragraph 16-48(a)(2). For members who have selected the pop-up option, if
the member's joint pensioner predeceases the member, the survivorship benefit shall be
deemed canceled and the member's annuity shall revert to the original life annuity monthly
benefit, effective on the first day of the month following the death of the member's joint
pensioner. By electing this option, the member consents to the actuarial adjustment of the
member's retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost of this option. The board, by
uniform rule, may establish a procedure for implementing this option.
25/130
(e) If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or designated beneficiary and
the member's retirement benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his
or her joint pensioner or designated beneficiary up to two (2) times without the approval
of the board or the current joint pensioner or designated beneficiary. The ability to change a
joint pensioner is contingent on the retiree agreeing to an actuarial recalculation of the
benefit to avoid any actuarial impact on the plan. The retiree is not required to provide
proof of the good health of the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner being removed,
who need not be living, but such information may be taken into account by the actuary in
recalculating the value of the benefit. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint
pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for
purposes of calculating the new payment. Any actuarial expenses resulting from the request
shall be charged to the retiree.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2009-05, § 2, 3-3-09; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 4, 4-2-
12)
§ 16-49. Beneficiaries.
(a) Beneficiary designation. Any member may from time to time designate, in writing, or
change such designation of, any person or persons, contingently or successively, to whom
the board of trustees shall pay the remainder of his accrued benefit on event of his death
where the member elected a form of distribution which provides for payments over a
certain period of time other than for life. A married member's beneficiary designation shall
not be valid unless the member's spouse consents to the beneficiary designation. A married
member's beneficiary designation does not require spousal consent if the member's spouse
a the designated beneficiary. The board of trustees shall prescribe the form for the written
designation of beneficiary and, upon the member's filing the form with the board of
trustees, it effectively shall revoke all designations filed prior to that date by the same
member.
(b) No beneficiary designation. If a member fails to name a beneficiary in accordance with
paragraph (a), above, or if the beneficiary named by a member predeceases him or dies
before complete distribution of the member's benefit, then the board of trustees shall pay
the member's remaining benefit, if any, in the following order of priority to:
(1) The member's surviving spouse;
(2) The personal representative of the member's estate.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99)

behalf of any member or beneficiary, results adversely to the member or to the beneficiary,
the board of trustees shall reimburse itself, or any member or members of the board of
trustees all costs and fees expended by it or them by surcharging all costs and fees against
the sums payable under the plan to the member or to the beneficiary, but only to the extent
a court of competent jurisdiction specifically authorizes and directs any such surcharges
and then only to the extent Code section 401(a)(13) does not prohibit any such surcharges.

29/130
The board may employ independent legal counsel at the plan's expense for the purposes

(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99)
§ 16-53. Limitation on benefits.
(a) The benefit of any member may not exceed the annual benefit authorized by section
415(b) IRC. For purposes of determining whether a member's benefit exceeds the
limitations of this section, the following shall apply:
(1) Adjustment if benefit not a straight life annuity.
a . If the form of benefit is other than a straight life annuity, such benefit shall be
adjusted actuarially to the equivalent of a straight life annuity to determine whether the
limitations set forth in this section are met.
b. For the purposes of this section, no adjustment shall be taken into account for any
ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits.
(2) Adjustment if benefit commences before age sixty-two (62).
a . If the benefit distribution commences before age sixty-two (62), the actual
retirement benefit shall not exceed the adjusted dollar limitation. The adjusted dollar
limitation shall be the equivalent, determined in a manner consistent with reduction of
benefits for early retirement under section 415(b)(2)(E) IRC, of one hundred sixty
thousand dollars ($160,000.00), as of January 1, 2002, adjusted annually pursuant to
section 415(d) IRC, commencing at age sixty-two (62). For purposes of this
adjustment, survivor benefits, that portion of a joint and survivor annuity which is the
survivor benefit, and any other ancillary benefits shall not be taken into account.
b. No adjustment shall be required under this subsection if the member is a "qualified
participant," as that term is defined in section 415(b)(2)(H) IRC.
c. No adjustment shall be required under this subsection if the benefit is payable due to
the member's disability or preretirement death.
(3) If the benefit distribution commences after age sixty-five (65), the adjusted dollar
limitation shall be the equivalent, determined in a manner consistent with the
adjustments under section 415(b)(2)(E) IRC, of one hundred sixty thousand dollars
($160,000.00), as of January 1, 2002, adjusted annually pursuant to section 415(d) IRC,
commencing at age sixty-five (65). For purposes of this adjustment, survivor benefits,
that portion of a joint and survivor annuity which is the survivor benefit, and any other
ancillary benefits shall not be taken into account.
(b) The maximum retirement benefit payable under this section to any member who has
completed less than ten (10) years of credited service shall be the number determined under
subsection (a) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
years of service, and the denominator of which shall be ten (10).
30/130
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the benefit payable to a member shall not be deemed to
exceed the limits of this section if the total benefits payable to a member under all defined
benefit plans maintained by the city do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and
the city has never maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member has
participated.
(Ord. No. 2013-08, § 1, 5-21-13)
EDITOR'S NOTE
Ord. No. 2013-08, § 1, adopted May 21, 2013, amended the Code by repealing former § 16-53
which pertained to maximum pension and derived from Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, adopted May 4,
1999.
§ 16-54. Latest date to begin distribution of benefits.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan to the contrary, a member's benefit shall
be distributed as follows:
(1 ) A member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the
member no later than the member's required beginning date, as defined in subsection (4)
of this section.
(2) If the member dies before required distributions have begun, the member's entire
interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
a . If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary,
distributions to the surviving spouse must begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or
before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age
seventy (70).
b. If the member's sole designated beneficiary is not the member's surviving spouse,
distributions to the designated beneficiary must begin by December 31 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.
c. If the member does not have a designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest
must be distributed within five (5) years of the date of the member's death.
(3) If the member dies after required distributions have begun, the remaining portion of
the member's benefit must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of
distributions being used at the time of the member's death.
(4) Required beginning date is the later of: April 1 of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the member attains or will have attained the age of seventy and
one-half (70½) or April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
member retires.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2013-08, § 2, 5-21-13)
§ 16-55. Repeal or termination of plan.
31/130
(a) This ordinance establishing the plan and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to
said plan and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part for any
reason or because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services,
or functions as provided in chapter 121; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance
shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the
amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall
have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall be nonforfeitable.
(b) If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, the
board shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of this
ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving
retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of
the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the
event of repeal, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, there shall be full vesting
(one hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the plan
shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value
required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits to be distributed, after taking into account
the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality if additional
assets are required, in which event the municipality shall continue to financially support
the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded.
(2) The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value,
that is, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or
substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each
member entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3).
(3) The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in
the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide
any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such
retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection
(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given
retirement income shall mean the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial
single-sum value may not be less than the member's accumulated contributions to the
plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously
paid to the employee.
(4) If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3),
and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall
be returned to the city.
(5) The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts
determined apportioned under subsection (3).
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2012-06, § 5, 4-2-12)
§ 16-56. Exemption from execution, non-assignability.
32/130
(a) Subject to Code Section 414(p) relating to qualified domestic relations orders, neither
a member nor a beneficiary shall anticipate, assign or alienate (either at law or in equity)
any benefit provided under the plan, and the board shall not recognizeany such anticipation,
assignment or alienation. Furthermore, a benefit under the plan is not subject to
attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process except the
recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the
monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for (i) accident, health, and long-term care
insurance premiums for the recipient, the recipient's spouse and the recipient's dependents,
(ii) child support, or (iii) alimony. The pension fund shall not incur any liability for making
or failing to make such withholding.
(1) Nothing contained in this plan shall prevent the board of trustees from complying
with the provisions of a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in Code section
414(p)).
(2) The board of trustees shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified
status of a domestic relations order. Upon receiving a domestic relations order, the board
of trustees promptly shall notify the member and any alternate payee named in the order,
in writing, of the receipt of the order and the plan's procedures for determining the
qualified status of the order. Within a reasonable period of time after receiving the
domestic relations order, the board of trustees shall determine the qualified status of the
order and shall notify the member and each alternate payee, in writing, of its
determination. The board of trustees shall provide notice under this paragraph by mailing
to the individual's address specified in the domestic relations order, or in a manner
consistent with Department of Labor regulations.
(3) If any portion of the member's nonforfeitable accrued benefit is payable during the
period the board of trustees is making its determination of the qualified status of the
domestic relations order, the board of trustees shall make a separate accounting of the
amounts payable. If the board of trustees determines the order is a qualified domestic
relations order within eighteen (18) months of the date amounts first are payable
following receipt of the order, the board of trustees shall distribute the payable amounts
in accordance with the order. If the board of trustees does not make its determination of
the qualified status of the order within the eighteen (18) month determination period, the
board of trustees shall distribute the payable amounts in the manner the plan would
distribute if the order did not exist and shall apply the order prospectively if the board of
trustees later determines the order is a qualified domestic relations order.
(4) The board of trustees shall make any payments or distributions required under this
section by separate benefit checks or other separate distribution to the alternate payee(s).

§ 16-57. Pension validity.
33/130
The board of trustees shall have the power to examine the facts upon which any pension
shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be
granted or obtained erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. The board is
empowered to purge the pension rolls or correct the pension amount of any person
heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or any person hereafter granted a
pension under this ordinance if the same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for
any reason; and to reclassify any person who has heretofore under any prior or existing law
been or who shall hereafter under this ordinance be erroneously, improperly or illegally
classified. Any overpayments or under payments shall be corrected and paid or repaid in a
reasonable manner determined by the board.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99)
§ 16-58. Forfeiture of pension.
(a) Any member who violates the provisions of F.S. § 112.3173, or who is convicted of
the following offenses committed prior to retirement, or whose employment is terminated
by reason of the member's admitted commission, aid or abetment of the following
specified offenses, shall forfeit all rights and benefits under this pension fund, except for
the return of the member's accumulated contributions, with simple interest thereon at five
(5) percent per annum. Specified offenses are as follows:
(1) The committing, aiding or abetting of felony embezzlement of public funds;
(2) The committing, aiding or abetting of any felony theft by a public officer or employee
from employer;
(3) The committing of felony bribery in connection with the employment of a public
officer or employee;
(4) Any felony specified in F.S. ch. 838;
(5) The committing of any felony by a public officer or employee who willfully and with
intent to defraud the public or the public agency, for which he or she acts or in which he
or she is employed, realizes or obtains or attempts to obtain a profit, gain, or advantage
for himself or herself or for some other person through the use or attempted use of the
power, rights, privileges, duties or position of the member's public office or employment
position.
( b) Conviction shall be defined as an adjudication of guilt by a court of competent
jurisdiction; or a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere. Conviction shall not include cases
where the adjudication of guilt is withheld and the accused is placed on probation.
(c) Court shall be defined as any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction which is
exercising its jurisdiction to consider a proceeding involving the alleged commission of a
specified offense. Prior to forfeiture, the board shall hold a hearing on which notice shall
be given to the member whose benefits are being considered for forfeiture. Said member
shall be afforded the right to have an attorney present. No formal rules of evidence shall
apply, but the member shall be afforded a full opportunity to present their case against
forfeiture.
34/130
(d) Any member who has received benefits from the plan in excess of their accumulated
contributions after their rights were forfeited shall be required to pay back to the fund the
amount of the benefits received in excess of their accumulated contributions, with simple
interest thereon at five (5) percent. The board may implement all legal action necessary to

(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99)
§ 16-61. Eligible rollover distributions.
Effective: Tuesday, November 17, 2015
(a) General. A distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board,
to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan specified by the distribute in a direct rollover.
(b) Definitions
(1) Eligible Rollover Distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of
all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distribute, except that an eligible
rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of
substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life
(or life expectancy) of the distribute or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the
distribute and the distributees designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten
years or more, any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section
401 (a)(9) of the Code, and the portion of any extent such distribution that is not
includible in gross income. For purposes of this section, any amount that is distributed
on account of hardship shall not be an eligible rollover distribution and the distribute
may not elect to have any portion of such a distribution paid directly to an eligible
retirement plan. For purposes of this section, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to
be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax
employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion
may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in
section 408(a) or (b) of the code, or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in
section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is
includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so
includible.
(2) Eligible retirement Plan: an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement
account described in Section 408(a)) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity
described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of
the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the
distributees eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of the eligible rollover
distribution to the surviving Spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual
retirement account or individual retirement annuity. For purposes of this section, an
eligible retirement plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b)
of the Code and an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by
a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or
political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred into such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall
also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in
section 414(p) of the Code.
(3) Distributee. A Distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the
employees or former employees surviving Spouse is a distributee with regard to the
interest of the Spouse.
(4) Direct Rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement
plan specified by the distribute.
(c) Notice of eligible rollover distributions
(1) The members' retirement plan shall, within a reasonable period of time before making
an eligible rollover distribution, provide a written explanation to the recipient of such
distribution explaining to the following:
36/130
a. The provisions under which the recipient may have the distribution directly
transferred to an eligible retirement plan and that the automatic distribution by direct
transfer applies to certain distributions in accordance with section 401(a)(31)(B) of the
Code.
b. The provision which requires the withholding of tax on the distribution if it is not
directly transferred to an eligible retirement plan.
c. The provisions under which the distribution will not be subject to tax if transferred
to an eligible retirement plan within sixty (60) days after the date on which the
recipient received the distribution.
d. The provisions under which distributions from the eligible retirement plan receiving
the distribution may be subject to restrictions and tax consequences which are different
from those applicable to distributions from the plan making such distribution.
(2) For the purpose of subsection (d)(1), the term "reasonable period of time" shall have
the meaning assigned to it under section 401(a)(31) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder.

one (1) year from the earlier of the date of their military discharge or their release from
service.

absence to perform qualified military service as described in section 414(u) IRC, the
member's beneficiary shall be entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating
to the period of qualified military service) that would have been provided under the plan
had the member resumed and then terminated employment on account of death, in
accordance with section 401(a)(37) IRC.
( 6 ) This section is intended to meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the
Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act ("USERRA"), and the

that this section does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA or the Heart Act, as
it they may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply.
(Ord. No. 99-02, § 2, 5-4-99; Ord. No. 2013-08, § 4, 5-21-13)
§ 16-63. Miscellaneous provisions.
(a) Interest of members in plan. At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any
part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than
for their exclusive benefit.
(b) No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the
city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of
members or a member's beneficiaries.
(c) Qualification of plan. It is intended that the plan will constitute a qualified public
pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code, as now in effect or hereafter
amended. Any modification or amendment of the plan shall apply retroactively, if necessary
or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the plan as meeting the requirements of the
applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other
applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or
adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder.
(d) Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall
serve only to reduce future city contributions.
(e) Discharge of members. Members entitled to a benefit shall not forfeit the same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall retain entitlement as herein described.
(f) Incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the
board, otherwise incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any
payment due him under the plan, the board may, unless and until claims shall have been
made by a duly appointed guardian of such person, make such payment or any part thereof
to such person's spouse, children, or other person deemed by the board to have incurred
expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person. Any payment so made
shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan for such payment.
38/130
(g) Personal data to board. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
must furnish to the board of trustees such evidence, data or information as the board of
trustees considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the plan. The
provisions of this plan are effective for the benefit of each member upon the condition
precedent that each member will furnish promptly full, true and complete evidence, data
and information when requested by the board of trustees, provided the board of trustees
shall advise each member of the effect of his failure to comply with its request.
(h) Address for notification. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
shall file with the board of trustees from time to time, in writing, his post office address
and any change of post office address. Any communication, statement or notice addressed
to a member, or beneficiary, at his last post office address filed with the board of trustees,
or as shown on the records of the city, shall bind the member, or beneficiary, for all
purposes of this plan.
( i ) State law. Florida law shall determine all questions arising with respect to the
provisions of this plan except to the extent federal statute supersedes state law.
(j) Employment not guaranteed. Nothing contained in this plan, or with respect to the
establishment of the trust, or any modification or amendment to the plan or trust, or in the
creation of any account, or the payment of any benefit, shall give any employee, employeeparticipant
or any beneficiary any right to continue employment,any legal or equitable right
against the employer, or employee of the employer, or against the trustee, or its agents or
employees, or against the plan administrator, except as expressly provided by the plan, the
trust, the act or by a separate agreement.
(k) Waiver of notice. Any person entitled to notice under the plan may waive the notice.
(l) Successors. The plan shall be binding upon all persons entitled to benefits under the
plan, their respective heirs and legal representatives, upon the city, its successors and
assigns, and upon the board of trustees, the plan administrator and their successors.
(m) Unclaimed account procedure.
(1) The plan does not require either the board of trustees to search for, or ascertain the
whereabouts of, any member or beneficiary. The board of trustees, by certified or
registered mail addressed to his last known address of record with the board of trustees
or the employer, shall notify any member, or beneficiary, that the member is entitled to a
distribution under this plan, and the notice shall quote the provisions of this section. If
the member, or beneficiary, fails to claim his distributive share or make his whereabouts
known in writing to the board of trustees within six (6) months from the date of mailing
of the notice, or before the termination or discontinuance of this plan, whichever should
first occur, the board of trustees shall treat the member's or beneficiary's unclaimed
payable accrued benefit as forfeited. The city shall use the amounts representing the
forfeited accrued benefit to reduce its contribution for future plan years.
(2) If a member or beneficiary who has incurred a forfeiture of his accrued benefit under
the provisions of paragraph (1) above makes a claim, at any time, for his forfeited
accrued benefit, the board of trustees shall restore the member's or beneficiary's forfeited
accrued benefit. The board of trustees shall direct the distribution of the member's or
beneficiary's accrued benefit as if the member's employment terminated in the plan year
in which the board of trustees restored the forfeited benefit.
39/130
(n) Co-mingling of investments. The board of trustees, for collective investment purposes,
may combine into one (1) trust fund the fund created under this plan with the trust created
under any other qualified retirement plan the city maintains. However, the board of trustees
shall maintain separate records of account for each trust in order to reflect property each
member's accrued benefit under the plan(s) in which the member is a member.
(o) Miscellaneous provisions affecting payment of benefitsGenerally. In general, the
board of trustees shall make payment of any pension directly to the member entitled to the
payment. However, the board of trustees paying the pension which a member is to receive
directly from the fund, may purchase from an insurance company selected by the board of
trustees a nontransferable annuity contract. The nontransferable annuity contract must
provide pension and other benefits in an amount not less than the pension and other
benefits a member would receive under this plan, and must satisfy all consent and
distribution requirements prescribed by the plan. In the event the board of trustees
purchases a nontransferable annuity contract for the benefit of a member, the board of
trustees may either assign the contract to the member or hold the contract for the benefit of
the member pursuant to the instructions of the board of trustees. The board of trustees also
may purchase a nontransferable annuity contract for the benefit of a designated beneficiary,
surviving spouse or alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order (as defined
in Code section 414(p)) entitled to distribution of all or a portion of the member's
nonforfeitable accrued benefit.
(p) No responsibility for city action. The board of trustees shall not have any obligation
nor responsibility with respect to any action required by the plan to be taken by the
employer, any member, nor for the failure of any of the above persons to act or make any
payment or contribution, or to otherwise provide any benefit contemplated under this plan,
nor shall the board of trustees be required to collect any contribution required under the
plan, or determine the correctness of the amount of any city contribution. The board of
trustees need not inquire into or be responsible for any action or failure to act on the part
of the others.
(q) No liability. The city assumes no obligation or responsibility to any of its employees,
members or beneficiaries for any act of, or failure to act, on the part of the board of
trustees.

§ 16-65. Military service prior to employment.

military service of the Armed Forces of the United States or the United States Merchant
Marine, voluntarily or involuntarily, honorably or under honorable conditions, prior to the
first and initial employment with the city shall be added to the member's years of credited
service provided that:
( 1 ) The member contributes to the fund the sum that the member would have
contributed, based on the member's salary and the member contribution rate in effect at
the time that the credited service is requested, had the member been a member of the
system for the years or completed months for which the member is requesting credit, plus
amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any
cost to the fund or the city, plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered
to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service.
40/130
(2) Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months
of the member's request for credit and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon

Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as

firefighter without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system, if after he
is rehired he remains re-employed with the same department not less than three (3) years,
otherwise his contributions shall be returned without interest. If the member who left the
employ of the fire department should not be re-employed as a firefighter within five (5)
years, then accumulated contribution will be returned upon the written request of the
member and all of his rights and benefits under the system shall be forfeited and

time the member is participating in the deferred retirement option plan (DROP) as

pension system maintained by the city, or has a period or periods of previous employment
as a firefighter, but is not eligible to receive credited service for this period or periods of

shall be used in determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such other credited
service will not, however, be considered in determining benefits under this system. Unless
otherwise provided herein only his or her credited service and compensation under this
system on or after his or her latest date of membership in this system will be considered for
benefit calculation. In addition, any benefit calculation for a member of this system who is
or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he or she has become a member of
another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based upon the member's average
final compensation, credited service and benefit accrual rate as of the date the member
ceases to be a firefighter.
Effective date means the date of the enactment of the ordinance, except where an earlier
effective date is required by reason of the application of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and
subsequent legislation, in which case the latest effective date required to comply with such
act and subsequent legislation shall be substituted with respect only to the specific portions
of the plan affected by such act.

thereafter. Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from employment with the city
on or after the normal retirement date. Each member who retires on or after normal
retirement age shall receive a normal retirement pension.

retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit consisting of a single life annuity which
shall commence on the first day of the month next following his or her retirement and be
continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred
twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit
for a firefighter shall equal: (1) two and one-half (2½) percent of average final
compensation, for each year of credited service for members separating from service prior
to October 1, 1998; or (2) three (3) percent of average final compensation, for each year of
credited service for members who separate from service on or after October 1, 1998.
Notwithstanding the preceding, effective October 1, 2012, for all members who have not
vet retired and/or entered the DROP as of the enactment date of September 17, 2013, the
maximum total benefit provided by the fund shall be limited to the lesser of either:
seventy-five thousand ($75,000.00) per year; or three (3) percent of average final
compensation, for each year of credited service. In no event shall the maximum total
benefit provided by the fund be less than two (2) percent of average final compensation, for

disability provisions of this plan so that the monthly benefit shall not exceed the greater of
the disability or retirement pension.

mandatory solely by reason of age prior to the required beginning date specified in section
16-175, hereof. The delayed retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident
with, or next following, actual retirement.

(e) Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his or her early retirement
date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable for
life, with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed, as follows:
(1) A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have
been the member's normal retirement date had he remained a firefighter and shall be
continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred
monthly retirement benefit shall be a life annuity determined in the same manner as for
retirement at normal retirement date except that credited service and average final
compensation shall be determined as of the early retirement date; or
(2) An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on the member's
early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The
benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (1) above, which is actuarially
reduced from the amount to which the member would have been entitled had the member
retired on his normal retirement date and with the same number of years of credited
service as at the time benefits commence and based on the member's average final
compensation at that date. In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed three
(3) percent for each year by which the member's age at retirement precedes the member's
normal retirement age.
( f ) Immediate and deferred payment of early retirement benefit. The board shall
commence payment of the immediate early retirement pension on the first day of the month
designated by the member as the annuity starting date, so long as such date follows the
member's termination of service with the city. If a member elects a deferred early
retirement pension, or fails to designate an annuity starting date, the board shall commence
payment following the member's attainment of normal retirement age.
(g) Termination benefitGenerally. A member whose employment terminates for any
reason prior to becoming eligible for an early or normal retirement pension, shall receive
either a deferred pension, calculated in the manner set forth in subsection (h) of this section
herein; or a refund benefit in an amount equal to the total contributions made by the
member to the plan. A member shall only be entitled to a deferred pension if he has at least
ten (10) years of credited service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a
member, at any time prior to the commencement of his normal retirement pension, his
early retirement pension or his deferred pension, may elect to receive a refund benefit in
lieu thereof.
(h) Amount of deferred pension. The member's deferred pension shall be a single life
annuity, with a one hundred twenty-month guarantee, computed in the same manner as the
early retirement pension if the member elects to begin receiving his monthly pension before
age fifty-five (55) or it shall be a single life annuity, with a one hundred twenty-month
guarantee, computed in the same manner as the normal retirement pension if the member
elects to begin receiving his pension on or after age fifty-five (55), with such benefit to be
determined as of the date on which his termination of employment occurs.
(i) Payment of deferred pension. A terminated member's deferred pension shall become
payable in the same manner as a normal retirement pension, or if elected by the member in
the manner provided in subsection (h) hereof, in the same manner as an early retirement
pension.
(j) Effective date of change in benefits. Members separating from service before October
1, 1998, shall only be entitled to the benefits provided by the plan prior to October 1,
1998.

be an employee of the city for a period of up to five (5) years. During this period, the
member and employer shall cease to make contributions to the fund and benefit accruals
shall cease at the date of withdrawal from the system. At the time of the withdrawal, the
member may elect any optional form of retirement income as allowed by the plan. The
amount of the monthly pension which would otherwise be paid shall be maintained as a
co-mingled DROP account(s) in the name of the member within the fund and shall be
segregated from other trust assets on a bookkeeping basis only.
a . Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive, by
designating full or partial allocation of the monthly benefit amount, either interest
and/or earnings on his or her accounts to be determined as provided below. The
member may elect, in writing, to change his or her election on a quarterly basis during
DROP participation. An election to change must be made at least thirty (30) days prior
to the beginning of a calendar quarter and shall be effective on the first day of the
calendar quarter immediately following such notice of election. There shall be no limit
on the number of such transfers.
1. Earnings election. Quarterly the DROP account shall share in the investment gains
and losses for the quarter at the same rate of the return earned by the total trust fund;
and/or
2. Interest election. The DROP account shall be credited interest based on the trust
fund's money market interest rate compounded quarterly.
3 . Any additional cost arising for the election of partial allocation of the monthly
benefit amount shall be paid by the member.
b. Regardless of the option selected by the participant, the board of trustees has the
right to accelerate payments in order to comply with section 401(a)(9) IRC and the
right to defer payments to comply with section 415 IRC.
(2) Termination of employment. Upon termination of employment, not later than five
(5) years following entry into the DROP program, the member shall commence receiving
the monthly benefit in the same form and amount as selected at the time of entry into the
DROP program. In addition, the member shall receive the value of his DROP account in
a single lump sum payment.
( 3 ) Continued employment. In the event that the member continues employment
following completion of the DROP period, the member shall forfeit his or her
entitlement to the accumulated assets in the DROP account, which account shall no
longer be segregated from the other assets of the plan, and such member shall deposit to
the fund an amount equal to the member contributions which would have been made had
the member continued as an active participant in the plan during the DROP period. Upon
later termination of employment, the retiring member shall receive benefit credit for
years and completed months during which he or she participated in the DROP program
and for which member contributions were subsequently made, as well as credited service
accrued before and after participation in the DROP plan.
55/130
(4) Computation of plan benefits. The benefits of a member who makes an election to
withdraw from the system while continuing to be an employee of the city, shall be
determined based upon including as salary, at the time of withdrawal, the amount of
accrued vacation and sick pay which would have been available had such member
terminated employment at the time of making the election. Notwithstanding the above,
payments made to a withdrawing member's DROP account shall be reduced by the
product obtained by multiplying the then applicable member contribution rate by the
amount of accrued vacation pay and sick pay which is includible in the above calculation.
(Ord. No. 98-18, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2000-12, § 2, 9-5-00; Ord. No. 2002-01, § 2,
5-7-02; Ord. No. 2004-07, § 2, 5-18-04; Ord. No. 2010-17, § 1, 10-19-10; Ord. No.
2013-16, § 2, 9-17-13)
§ 16-167. Disability.
(a) Disability benefits in-duty. Each firefighter who is a member in the system and who
shall have become totally and permanently disabled, while, actively employed as a
firefighter with the city to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically
determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a
firefighter, and which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a
firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a
monthly pension equal to either, (i) two and one-half (2½) percent of his or her
compensation for a member separating from service prior to October 1, 1998, or (ii) three
(3) percent of his or her compensation for a member separating from service on or after
October 1, 1998, multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the
minimum amount paid to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the member's
compensation. For the purposes of this paragraph, compensation shall be deemed to be the
greater of the member's average compensation based upon his or her pay status at the time
the disability occurred or his or her average final compensation.
( 1 ) Any condition or impairment of health of a firefighter caused by tuberculosis,
hypertension or heart disease resulting in total or partial disability or death shall be
presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by
competent evidence; provided, that such firefighter shall have successfully passed a
physical examination upon entering into such service, including a cardiogram, which
examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that
such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life
insurance or disability insurance.
( 2 ) The presumption provided for in this paragraph (2) shall apply only to those
conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1,
1996.
a. Definitions. As used in this paragraph (2), the following definitions apply:
1 . "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other
body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational
transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease
Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis
or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids,
including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which
infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons.
56/130
2 . "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed fulltime
by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law
enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a
high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or
tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the
term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person
employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed
by a subsidiary thereof.
3 . "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B,
hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical
community.
4 . "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a
person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties
associated with his or her employment:
i. Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-healthcare setting where there is
a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons;
ii. At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an
emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of
containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments
exposed to body fluids;
iii. Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected
law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or
i v. Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of
prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while
on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing
such duties, may be exposed to body fluids.
5 . "Occupation exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or
tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties
that may place a worker at risk of infection.
b . Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a
condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal
meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or
partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of
duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be
entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. §
92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief:
1. In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not:
i . Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have
sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his
employment;
i i . Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion
arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present
employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation
disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to
indicate the presence of hepatitis;
57/130
iii. Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by
the Centers for Disease Control or the SurgeonGeneral of the United States or had
sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual
practices or other high-risk behavior; or
iv. Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician.
2 . In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately
preceding diagnosis he or she was not exposed, outside the scope of his or her
employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be
an asymptomatic carrier of the disease.
3. In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative
tuberculosis skin test, he or she has not been exposed, outside the scope of his or her
employment, to any person known by him or her to have tuberculosis.
c. Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form
of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease
for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the
given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency
rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the
immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that
the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's
health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or
public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the
member from the benefits of the presumption.
d. Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonable
suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to
the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such
exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or
accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational
exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis.
e . Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the
presumption provided by this section:
1 . An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have
undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable
disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions
derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This
paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis.
2. On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be
required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for any
evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis.
58/130
(b) Disability benefits off-duty. Every firefighter who is a member in the system with ten
(10) years or more credited service who shall have become totally and permanently
disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or
mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is
not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall be entitled to a
monthly pension equal to either: (i) two and one-half (2½) percent of compensation for a
member separating from service prior to October 1, 1998, or (ii) three (3) percent of
compensation for a member separating from service on or after October 1, 1998,
multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount
paid to the member shall be twenty-five (25) percent of his compensation. This provision
shall not apply to a member who has reached early or normal retirement age. Any disability
occurring after termination shall not constitute a basis for disability payments. For the
purposes of this paragraph, compensation shall be deemed to the greater of the member's
average compensation based upon his or her pay status at the time the disability occurred
or his or her average final compensation.
( c ) Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each firefighter who is claiming
disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability or
death was not occasioned primarily by:
(1) Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics.
(2) Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or
civil insurrections.
(3) Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime.
(4) Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces.
(5) Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall
have terminated.
(6) A condition pre-existing the firefighter's membership in the system. No member shall
be entitled to a disability pension because of or due to the aggravation of a specific
injury, impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of membership in
the system; provided, that such preexisting condition and its relationship to a later injury,
impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence.
Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after
membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition
different from some other injury, impairment or other medical condition existing at or
prior to said membership.
( d ) Physical examination requirement. A firefighter shall not become eligible for
disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified
physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for
that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this
purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable
and prudent to do so.
59/130
Any firefighter receiving disability benefits under provisions of this section shall be
periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons,
who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such a disability has ceased to exist. If
the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent
that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall
recommend to the city that the disability retirement income be discontinued and the retiree
be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy
the same rights that member had at the time he was placed upon pension.
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the firefighter claiming
and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the board of this system. All other
reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as,
but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the
board.
If the firefighter recovers from disability and re-enters the service of the city as a
firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning
with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and
ending with the date he re-entered the service of the city will not be considered as credited
service for the purposes of the plan.
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all
disability claims.
(e) Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of
the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after
the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be
payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a
partial month shall be paid together with the fist payment. The last payment will be:
(1) If the firefighter recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the
payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or
( 2 ) If the firefighter dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal
retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the one
hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later.
(3) Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled firefighter
shall be paid to the firefighter's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as provided in F.S.
§§ 175.181 and 175.201.
(f) A disabled member may select an actuarially equivalent optional form of benefit in the
same manner as a retired member, or in such other actuarially equivalent form as may be
allowed by the board.
(Ord. No. 98-18, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2000-12, § 2, 9-5-00)
§ 16-168. Pre-retirement death.
60/130
(a) Prior to eligibility for deferred benefit or retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased
member who was not receiving monthly benefits, or who was not yet eligible for a deferred
benefit under subsection (g) of section 16-166, early retirement, or normal retirement,
shall receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated
contribution, or in the event an annuity or life insurance contract has been purchased by the
board on such firefighter, then the beneficiary shall receive instead the death benefits
available under such contract, subject to the limitations on such benefits set forth in F.S. §
175.081, whichever amount is greater.
(b) Deceased members eligible for deferred benefit or retirement benefit. The beneficiary
of any member who dies and who, at the date of his or her death was eligible for a deferred
benefit under subsection (g) of section 16-166, or early retirement, or normal retirement,
shall be entitled to a benefit as follows:
(1) If the member was eligible for a deferred benefit, but not eligible for normal or early
retirement, the beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on
the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal
retirement, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal
retirement based on the deceased member's, date of birth, credited service and average
final compensation as of the date of his or her death and reduced as for early retirement,
if applicable. The beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for
ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits
prior to the early retirement date.
(2) If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary
shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month
following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal retirement
date, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal
retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final
compensation as of the date of his or her death and reduced as for early retirement, if
applicable.
(3) A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to
receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions.
(c) Optional death benefit for members killed in line of duty. In lieu of the benefits
described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the surviving spouse of any member
who dies as a direct result of an occurrence arising in the performance of service, or if
there is no surviving spouse, the legal guardian of the youngest living child, may elect a
benefit payable as follows:
(1) To the spouse, a monthly benefit payable until death equal to fifty (50) percent of the
member's average final compensation.
(2) To each minor child, in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to ten (10)
percent of the member's average final compensation, subject to a limitation of a total of
eighty (80) percent of average final compensation for the spouse and children combined.
Each child's pension shall terminate at death or upon attaining eighteen (18) years of age,
unless such child continues to be a full-time student at an accredited institution of higher
learning or at an accredited institution providing vocational or technical training, in
which case such payments may continue until such child attains the age of twenty-one
(21).
61/130
Upon death of the spouse, the allowance for each child shall be paid in trust or as
otherwise determined by the board, to eligible children, not to exceed a combined total
of fifty (50) percent of the member's average final compensation. The manner of
handling and administering the pension to any child or children shall be determined by
the board. No survivor pension shall be paid to any stepchild of a deceased member
who had not been legally adopted by such member.
(3) There shall be in any event a minimum total service-incurred death benefit equal in
amount to four (4) times the member's average final compensation. If such amount has
not yet been paid in total at such time as benefits cease under subsections (c)(1) and (c)
(2) above, then the balance shall be payable in a lump sum to the member's designated
beneficiary, and if there be none, then to such member's estate.
(4) Notwithstanding the above, neither a surviving spouse, nor minor children may elect
the optional death benefit described in this subsection (c) if the member has designated
someone other than his spouse as his beneficiary.
(Ord. No. 98-18, § 2, 10-20-98)
§ 16-169. Optional forms of benefits.
(a) In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal,
early, or delayed retirement, or deferred pension, as specified herein, a member, upon
written request to the board, which request shall be retained by the board, may elect to
receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance
with one (1) of the following options:
(1) A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the member for his or
her lifetime only.
(2) A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member during
the lifetime of the member, and following the death of the member, one hundred (100)
percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3) percent, or fifty (50)
percent of such monthly amounts payable to a joint pensioner for his or her lifetime.
Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his or her spouse, the present value of
payments to the retiree shall not be less than fifty (50) percent of the total present value
of payments to the retiree and his or her joint pensioner.
(3) An actuarially equivalent larger monthly amount, with a reduction in the monthly
amount when the member's social security benefits are estimated to start so that the
member's total monthly benefit, inclusive of social security benefits, will remain
constant upon the starting date of his social security benefits.
62/130
(b) The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner
(subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any,
payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change
such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one
(1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with
a joint pensioner or beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have
commenced, the member may thereafter change his or her designated beneficiary up to two
(2) times and may change his or her joint pensioner up to two (2) times without the
approval of the board or the current designated survivor. The retiree member need not
provide proof of the good health of the designated survivor being removed, and the
designated survivor being removed need not be living. Provided that in the absence of
proof of good health, the actuary will assume that the designated survivor being removed
has deceased for purposes of calculating the new benefit payment.
(c) The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change
shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive
benefits under the system shall thereupon cease.
( d) Upon change of a retiree's beneficiary or joint pensioner in accordance with this
section, the board shall adjust the retiree's monthly benefit by application of actuarial
calculations to insure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the retiree's then
current benefit. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall
make repayment of any overage of previously paid pension benefits as a result of said
recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the
board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated
beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the
retiree subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in section 16-170
(e) Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with
the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations:
(1) If a member dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date,
whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any
person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 16-168
(2 ) If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the
member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically
and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member
upon his or her retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is
made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated
by the member prior to his or her retirement.
(3) If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or
retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for
payment for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the
remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 16-170
63/130
(4) If a member continues beyond his or her normal retirement date pursuant to the
provisions of section 16-166, and dies prior to his or her actual retirement and while an
option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement
income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a
beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts
computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his or her
death occurred.
(f) Except as set forth in subsection (b), hereof, a retiree may not change his or her
retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check.
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to
make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the
total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the
power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a
complete discharge of all obligations under the system with the regard to such member and
shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
persons.
(Ord. No. 98-18, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2010-08, § 3, 5-4-10; Ord. No. 2012-13, § 1,
8-21-12)
§ 16-170. Beneficiaries.
(a) Beneficiary designation. A member may from time to time designate a beneficiary in
writing, or change such designation of, any person or persons, contingently or successively,
to whom the trustee shall pay the remainder of his benefit in the event of his death. The
board shall prescribe the form for the written designation of beneficiary and, upon the
member's filing the form with the board, it effectively shall revoke all designations filed
prior to that date by the same member. This subsection (a) shall not supersede the
provisions of subsection (b) of section 16-169
(b) No beneficiary designation. If a member fails to name a beneficiary in accordance with
the preceding subsection, or if the beneficiary named by a member predeceases him or her,
or dies before complete distribution of the member's benefit, then the board shall pay the
member's remaining benefit, if any, to the member's estate.
(Ord. No. 98-18, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2000-12, § 2, 9-5-00)
§ 16-171. Claims procedures before the board decision.
(a) Claims of affected persons.
(1) The board shall grant an initial hearing upon receipt of a written request ("claim"), on
matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including
members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board.
(2) The board shall review the claim at an initial hearing and enter an order within ninety
(90) days from the date of receipt of the claim. The board may extend the time for
entering the order at an initial hearing for an additional ninety (90) days if it determines
such time is necessary for full discovery and adequate review. The chairman of the board
or general counsel and the claimant may stipulate to further extensions of time.
(3) The claimant shall have the right to be represented by counsel at any or all times
throughout the claims procedure.
64/130
(b) Initial hearing.
(1 ) At the initial hearing, the only evidence to be considered by the board shall be
documentary evidence contained in his employment and pension file, including but not
limited to, correspondence, medical records and reports of treating physicians and/or
examining physicians, and evidence received pursuant to paragraph (2), below.
(2) Other than questions from the trustees, there will be no taking of additional evidence
at the initial hearing, except that the claimant will be afforded five (5) minutes to make a
presentation, which shall be limited to comments and/or arguments as to the evidence or
information already contained in the pension file, including the report of the examining
physician.
(3) Upon completion of the review of the claim at the initial hearing, the board shall
enter an order setting forth its findings and conclusions on the claim. The written order
shall be provided to the claimant. The order shall include:
a. The specific findings and conclusions of the board, including specific references to
pertinent provisions of the plan on which such conclusions are based;
b . A description of any additional material or information that the board may deem
necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her claim, together with the reasons why
such material or information is necessary; and
c. An explanation of the right to a full hearing on the claim and the time limit in which

68/130
§ 16-175. Internal Revenue Code compliance.
(a) Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the
annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar
limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a
limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the
benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation.
(1) Definitions Used in this section.
a . "Annual pension" means the benefits received by a participant under this Plan
expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable
exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a
straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of:
(i) The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant
under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit
payable to the participant; or
(ii) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity
starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable
to the participant, computed using a five-percent interest assumption and the
applicable mortality table described in § 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting
date.
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly
related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, preretirement
incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the
form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit
is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise
satisfy the limitations of this Subsection (a), and the amount payable under the form
of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of this Subsection (a)
applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to §
415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic benefit increase feature is
included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic
increases to the benefits paid in that form.
b . "Dollar limitation" means one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)
(subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said
amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as
follows:
(i) Except with respect to a participant who is a "Qualified Participant" as defined in
Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability
benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age sixtytwo
(62) the Age-Adjusted Dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of:
69/130
1 . The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as
a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62), where annual
payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62) are
equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the
limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
computed using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under §
1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the
participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting
date); and
2. The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d)) multiplied by the
ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual
amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age sixty-two
(62), with both annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section
415.
(ii) For benefits beginning after the age of sixty-five (65), the age-adjusted Dollar
Limitation is equal to the lesser of:
1 . The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as
a straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65), where annual payments
under the straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65) are equal to the
dollar limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d)
for the limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
computed using a five-percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under
§ 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the
participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting
date); and
2 . The section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section
415(d) and §1.415(d)-1 for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the
annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under
the plan to the adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity. The adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the
immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed
disregarding the participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including
actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset
accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing
straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415. The
adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity means the annual amount of the
straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical
participant who is sixty-five (65) years old and has the same accrued benefit (with
no actuarial increases for commencement after age sixty-five (65) as the participant
receiving the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after
age sixty-five (65) and without applying the rules of section 415).
(iii) There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar limitation with respect to benefits
beginning between the ages of sixty-two (62) and sixty-five (65).
(2) The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the Annual Pension
does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the participant has never
participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city.
70/130
(3) Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to
scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under subsection
415(d) of the Code.
(4) In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the
plan, the dollar limitation set forth in paragraph (1)b. of this subsection (a) shall be
multiplied by a fraction - (i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part
thereof) of participation in the Plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.
(5 ) Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee
contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into
account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code.
(6) Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained
by the city, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit
plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at
that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that
the participant's combined benefits will equal the Dollar Limitation.
(7) For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one
(1) annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity
starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date),
actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the
other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new
starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d),
and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations.
(8) The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection (a)
shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of
the Code) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of
distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations.
(9) The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of
the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall
be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and
regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder,
such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of
Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application
of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions.
(b) Required beginning date: Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of
a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the
participant's Required Beginning Date, which is defined as the later of:
( 1 ) April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the
participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (70½) years; or
( 2 ) April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the
participant retires.
(c) Required minimum distributions.
71/130
(1 ) Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or
begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required
beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 16-175
(2) Death of participant before distributions begin.
a. If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will
be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(i) If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by
December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age
seventy and one-half (70½), if later.
(ii) If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated
beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December
31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
participant died.
(iii) If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the
year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's
death.
b. The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows:
(i) Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the
date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the
participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time
described in subparagraph (2)a. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or
over a period certain not exceeding:
1. Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the
life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age
as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year of the participant's death; or
2. If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life
expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as
of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting
date.
(ii) No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions
begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following
the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will
be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of
the participant's death.
c. Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case
in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins,
(ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin,
subparagraphs (2)a. and 2b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were the
participant.
72/130
( 3 ) Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's
lifetime.
a . Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the
participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for
the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be
made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary
after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the
annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using
the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If
the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement
in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated
beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
b . Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated
beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the
period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime
may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform
Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes
the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution
period for the participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the
Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations
plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's
birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is
the participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period
certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the
participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph
(3)b., or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the
participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's
attained ages as of the participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that
contains the annuity starting date.
(4) Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an
annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the
required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be
made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)a., (4)b. and (4)c. below. If the participant's
interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section
401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest
which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code
will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the
Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts.
a . General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of
annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the
following requirements:
(i) The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not
longer than one year;
73/130
(ii) The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not
longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above,
whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c);
(iii) Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be
changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted;
(iv) Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:
1 . By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage
increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
2 . To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to
provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life
was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the
participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the
meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code;
3. To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death;
or
4. To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment.
b. Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must
be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the
participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin
under subparagraph (2)a.(i) or (2)a.(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is
required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the
end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar
year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bimonthly,
monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals
as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the
calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or
after the participant's required beginning date.
c . Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits
accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year
will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
(5 ) For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the
participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the
participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required
beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions
are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)a. above), the date distributions
are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(6) Definitions.
a. Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under
the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and
Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.
74/130
b. Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is
required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first
distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year
which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning
after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in
which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection
(c).
c . Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.
(d)
(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a
direct rollover.
(2) Definitions: The following definitions apply to this section:
a. Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of
all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible
rollover distribution does not include:
(i) Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments
(not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the
distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or
more;
(ii) Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)
(9) of the Code;
(iii) The portion of any distribution that is a hardship distribution described in
Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code; and
(iv) The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an
eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax
employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such
portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution
plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion
of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.

(3 ) Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement
account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity
described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of
the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust
described in Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the
Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan, or, with respect
to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of
Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
(4) Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the
employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former
Employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1,
2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code
who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual
retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement
annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee.
(5) Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement
plan specified by the distributee.
( e ) Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any
mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the
plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1000.00).
( f ) Compensation Limitations Under 401(a)(17): In addition to other applicable
limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the
contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan
shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning
after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is two hundred
thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost
of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding twelve (12)
months, over which Compensation is determined (determination period) beginning in such
calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the
EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of months in the determination period, and the denominator of which
is twelve (12).
Any reference in the plan to the limitation under Section 401 (a)(17) of the Code shall
mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this provision.

§ 16-176. Repeal or termination of plan and distribution of fund.
76/130
(a) The article establishing the plan and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said
plan and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part for any reason
or because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or
functions as provided in chapter 121; provided that if this or any subsequent article shall be
amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of
benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued
to the member or beneficiary shall be nonforfeitable.
(b) If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, the
board shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of this
article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement
allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options
provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of
repeal, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, there shall be full vesting (one
hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the plan shall
be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value
required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits to be distributed, after taking into account
the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality if additional
assets are required, in which event the municipality shall continue to financially support
the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded.
(2) The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value,
that is, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or
substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each
member entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3).
(3) The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in
the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide
any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such
retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection
(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given
retirement income is shall mean the single premium payable for such annuity. The
actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the member's accumulated contributions
to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits
previously paid to the employee.
(4) If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3),
and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall
be returned to the municipality less return to the state of the state's contributions,
provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality
and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided
proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality and the state.
(5) The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts
determined apportioned under subsection (3).
If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written
notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the
municipality or special fire control district or the board of trustees of the firefighters'
pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the
Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance
with this section.

shall not recognize any such anticipation, assignment or alienation. Furthermore, a benefit
under the plan is not subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or
equitable process; except the recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of
trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits
being received from the city and/or for benefits being received by the retiree from the
certified bargaining unit, and to make any payments for child support, alimony, and to pay
for accident, health, and long-term care insurance premiums for the recipient, the
recipient's spouse and the recipient's dependents. The pension fund shall not incur any
liability for making or failing to make such withholdings.

settle the claim at any time, and to appeal or to not appeal from any adverse judgment or
ruling, and in either event will indemnify, defend and hold harmless any members of the
board from the judgment, execution, or levy thereon.

entity liable to defend the claim or liable for payment of the judgment or claim, from any
liability, nor does this section waive any provision of law affording the city immunity from
any suit in whole or part, or waive any other substantive or procedural rights the city may

pay for claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of the board which constitute
felonies or gross malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office.

part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than
for their exclusive benefit.
81/130
(b) No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the
city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of
members or a member's beneficiaries.
(c) Qualification of plan. It is intended that the plan will constitute a qualified public
pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code, as now in effect or hereafter
amended. Any modification or amendment of the plan shall apply retroactively, if necessary
or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the plan in meeting the requirements of the
applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other
applicable provisions of the United States federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter
amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder.
(d) Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall
serve only to reduce future city contributions.
(e) Discharge of members. Members entitled to a benefit shall not forfeit the same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall retain entitlement as herein described.
(f) Incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the
board, otherwise incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any
payment due him under the plan, the board may, unless and until claims shall have been
made by a duly appointed guardian of such person, make such payment or any part thereof
to such person's spouse, children, or other person deemed by the board to have incurred
expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person. Any payment so made
shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan for such payment.
(g) Personal data to board. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
must furnish to the board such evidence, data or information as the board considers
necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the plan. The provisions of this plan
are effective for the benefit of each member upon the condition precedent that each
member will furnish promptly full, true and complete evidence, data and information when
requested by the board, provided the board shall advise each member of the effect of his
failure to comply with its request.
(h) Address for notification. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
shall file with the board from time to time, in writing, his post office address and any
change of post office address. Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a
member, or beneficiary, at his last post office address filed with the board, or as shown on
the records of the city, shall bind the member, or beneficiary, for all purposes of this plan.
(i) Word usage. Words used in the masculine shall apply to the feminine where applicable,
and wherever the context of the plan dictates, the plural shall be read as the singular and the
singular as the plural.
( j ) State law. Florida law shall determine all questions arising with respect to the
provisions of this plan except to the extent federal statute supersedes state law.
(k) Employment not guaranteed. Nothing contained in this plan, or with respect to the
establishment of the trust, or any modification or amendment to the plan or trust, or in the
creation of any account, or the payment of any benefit, shall give any employee, employee
member or any beneficiary any right to continue employment, any legal or equitable right
against the city, or employee of the city, or against the trustee, or its agents or employees,
or against the plan administrator, except as expressly provided by the plan, the trust, the act
or by a separate agreement.
(l) Waiver of notice. Any person entitled to notice under the plan may waive the notice.
82/130
(m) Successors. The plan shall be binding upon all persons entitled to benefits under the
plan, their respective heirs and legal representatives, upon the city, its successors and
assigns, and upon the trustee, the board, the plan administrator and their successors.
(n) Unclaimed account procedure.
(1) The plan does not require either the board to search for, or ascertain the whereabouts
of, any member or beneficiary. The board, by certified or registered mail addressed to his
last known address of record with the board or the city, shall notify any member, or
beneficiary, that he is entitled to a distribution under this plan, and the notice shall quote
the provisions of this section. If the member, or beneficiary, fails to claim his distributive
share or make his whereabouts known in writing to the board within six (6) months from
the date of mailing of the notice, or before the termination or discontinuance of this plan,
whichever should first occur, the board shall treat the member's or beneficiary's
unclaimed payable accrued benefit as forfeited. The city shall use the amounts
representing the forfeited accrued benefit to reduce its contribution for future plan years.
(2) If a member or beneficiary who has incurred a forfeiture of his accrued benefit under
the provisions of paragraph (1) above makes a claim, at any time, for his forfeited
accrued benefit, the board shall restore the member's or beneficiary's forfeited accrued
benefit. The board shall direct the distribution of the member's or beneficiary's accrued
benefit. The board shall direct the distribution of the member's or beneficiary's accrued
benefit as if the member's employment terminated in the plan year in which the board
restored the forfeited benefit.
( o ) Co-mingling of investments. The board for collective investment purposes, may
combine into one (1) trust fund the trust created under this plan with the trust created
under any other qualified retirement plan the city maintains. However, the board shall
maintain separate records of account for each trust in order to reflect properly each
member's accrued benefit under the plan(s) in which he is a member.
(p) Miscellaneous provisions affecting payment of benefits generally. In general, the
board shall make payment of any pension directly to the member entitled to the payment.
However, the board, in lieu of paying the pension which a member is to receive directly
from the fund, may purchase from an insurance company selected by the board a
nontransferable annuity contract. The nontransferable annuity contract must provide
pension and other benefits in an amount not less than the pension and other benefits a
member would receive under this plan, and must satisfy all consent and distribution
requirements prescribed by the plan. In the event the board purchase a nontransferable
annuity contract for the benefit of a member, the board may either assign the contract to the
member or hold the contract for the benefit of the member pursuant to the instructions of
the board. The board also may purchase a nontransferable annuity contract for the benefit
of a designated beneficiary or surviving spouse entitled to distribution of all or a portion
of the member's nonforfeitable accrued benefit.
( q ) No responsibility for city action. The board shall not have any obligation nor
responsibility with respect to any action required by the plan to be taken by the city, any
member, nor for the failure of any of the above persons to act or make any payment or
contribution, or to otherwise provide any benefit contemplated under this plan, nor shall
the board be required to collect any contribution required under the plan, or determine the
correctness of the amount of any city contribution. The board need not inquire into or be
responsible for any action or failure to act on the part of the others.
83/130
(r) No liability. The city assumes no obligation or responsibility to any of its employees,
members or beneficiaries for any act of, or failure to act, on the part of the board.
(s) Statutory preemption. In the event of any conflict with the provisions of this plan, the
provisions of F.S. Ch. 175 shall control to the extent of any such conflict.
(t) Statutory amendment. Any and all amendments to F.S. ch. 175, the compliance of
which are necessary for the continued participation of the plan under F.S. ch. 175, are
hereby adopted by reference as if made by the city.

Benefit.
Effective: Tuesday, December 06, 2016
(a) There is hereby provided, in addition to all other benefits provided in this Article, a defined contribution component supplemental
retirement benefit. The defined contribution component supplemental retirement benefit shall consist of an individual share account for
each Member of the Plan, including DROP participants. The supplemental retirement benefit shall be funded solely by premium tax
revenues in excess of the 2013 frozen amount received by the city pursuant to F.S. Ch. 175, as provided for by the City of Lake Wales Code
of Ordinances. Effective October 1, 2016, fifty percent (50%) of the premium tax revenues received by the City in excess of the 2013 frozen
amount shall be allocated to Members share accounts as provided for herein with the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the premium tax
revenue received by the City to be used at the discretion of the City toward current year benefits (either defined benefit or defined
contribution), as an immediate reduction of unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) balance, or reserved as a prepaid sponsor contribution
toward future required funding. Member share accounts shall be credited with premium tax revenues and investment earnings and losses
and account distributions as outlined herein.
(b) Annual crediting. Effective January 1, 2017, and each January 1 thereafter, the share account of each Member and DROP participant on
the Citys payroll as of the preceding September 30 shall be credited as follows. Each Member and DROP participant who was employed
on the preceding September 30 shall receive one share for each complete year and fractional part of years of Credited Service, as defined
in section 16-161, determined as of the end of the Plan year ending on the same September 30. The total number of shares thus
determined shall be divided into the total premium tax revenues received during that plan year to determine the amount to be credited to
the share account of each eligible share plan participant.

Service. The share account balances of such non-vested terminated Members shall be redistributed among all eligible participants share
accounts in the same manner as premium tax revenues in the following calendar year. The designated beneficiary of a Member who dies

There shall be no forfeiture of a Members share account based on the Members death, disability, or termination of employment with ten

fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police
officer. A member may voluntarily leave his contributions in the fund for a period of five
(5) years after leaving the employ of the city pending the possibility of being re-employed
as a police officer without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If
the member who left the employ of the police department should not be re-employed as a
police officer within five (5) years, then his accumulated contribution will be returned
upon the written request of the member. Upon return of a member's accumulated
contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated.
However, no member will receive credit for service for which he has withdrawn his
contributions unless he pays into the fund the contribution he has withdrawn with interest,
at the actuarially assumed rate, within ninety (90) days of his re-employment. In the event
that a member of this system has also accumulated credited service in another pension
system maintained by the city, or has a period or periods of previous employment as a
police officer, but is not eligible to receive credited service for this period or periods of
previous employment for benefit calculation purposes, then such other credited service
shall be used in determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such other credited
service will not, however, be considered in determining benefits under this system. Unless
otherwise provided herein only his or her credited service and compensation under this
system on or after his or her latest date of membership in this system will be considered for
benefit calculation. In addition, any benefit calculation for a member of this system who is
or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he or she has become a member of
another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based upon the member's average
final compensation, credited service and benefit accrual rate as of the date the member
ceases to be a police officer. Years and completed months of employment with the city
during which time the member is participating in the deferred retirement option plan
(DROP) as described in this plan, shall not be counted as credited service for benefit
purposes unless the member elects to continue employment with the city following the
completion of the DROP period and makes payment of the omitted member contributions.
In the event of continued employment following participation in the DROP program, the
member will receive credit for the DROP period in accordance with the required
procedure. In the event that a member of this system has also accumulated credited service
in another pension system maintained by the city, or has a period or periods of previous
employment as a police officer, but is not eligible to receive credited service for this period
or periods of previous employment for benefit calculation purposes, then such other
credited service shall be used in determining eligibility for early or normal retirement. Such
other credited service will not, however, be considered in determining benefits under this
system. Unless otherwise provided herein only his or her credited service and
compensation under this system on or after his or her latest date of membership in this
system will be considered for benefit calculation. In addition, any benefit calculation for a
member of this system who is or becomes eligible for a benefit from this system after he or
she has become a member of another pension system maintained by the city, shall be based
upon the member's average final compensation, credited service and benefit accrual rate as
of the date the member ceases to be a police officer.
Effective date means the date of the enactment of the ordinance, except where an earlier
effective date is required by reason of the application of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and

or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books
and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund.
f . The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or
securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific
proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in
mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions
with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting
trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories
designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or
discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to
exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other
investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be in the best interest of the
fund to exercise.
g. The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any
court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein.
94/130
h. Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it
is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable
to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after
receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific, information,
certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to
take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification,
direction or instruction has been received by it.
i. Any overpayment or underpayment from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary
caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum
approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to
which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to, shall be paid.
Overpayment shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or
collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayment shall be made up from the fund
in a prudent manner.
j. The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet
the payments and benefits herein provided for.
k. In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, any judgment entered in
such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons.
l. Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or
carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all
times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided
further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.
(7) The board shall not have any obligation or responsibility with respect to any action
required by the plan to be taken by the city or, any member, nor shall the board be
required to collect any contribution required under the plan, or determine the correctness
of the amount of any contribution. The board need not inquire into or be responsible for
any action or failure to act on the part of the others.
(8) The board and the city in no way guarantee the trust fund from loss or depreciation.
The city does not guarantee the payment of any money which may be or becomes due to
any person from the fund. The liability of the board to make any payment from the fund
at any time and all times is limited to the then available assets of the fund.
(9) The board shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any investment manager or
managers the board may appoint, nor shall the board be under any obligation to invest or
otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of a properly
appointed investment manager. The board and any properly appointed investment
manager may execute a letter of agreement as a part of this plan delineating the duties,
responsibilities and liabilities of the investment manager with respect to any part of the
trust fund under the control of the investment manager.
(10) At least once every three (3) years, the board shall retain an independent consultant
professionally qualified to evaluate the performance of professional money managers.
The independent consultant shall make recommendations to the board regarding the
selection of money managers for the next investment term. These recommendations shall
be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The date, time, place,
and subject of this meeting shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in
the municipality at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearings.
95/130
(11) The board shall identify and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may
have in any scrutinized company, as defined in Florida Statutes, Section 215.473, and
proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities it may have in
such company beginning January 1, 2010 and shall thereafter be prohibited from
purchasing or holding such securities. The divestiture of any such security must be
completed by September 30, 2010. In accordance with Ch. 2009-97, Laws of Florida, no
person may bring any civil, criminal, or administrative action against the board or any
employee, officer, director, or advisor of such board based upon the divestiture of any
security pursuant to this paragraph.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 2, 5-4-10)
§ 16-235. Contributions.
(a) Member contributions.
(1) Amount. Each member of the plan shall be required to make regular contributions to
the fund in the amount of a portion of his or her wages as established by contract
between the city and the bargaining unit. Member contributions withheld by the city on
behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board at least monthly. The
contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as city contributions
pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the
contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax
purposes. For all other purposes of the plan, such contributions shall be considered to be
member contributions.
(2) Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction.
(b) State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state
for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of
the city shall be deposited in the trust fund comprising part of this system immediately, and
under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city.
(c) City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly
contributions to the trust fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year between
the total aggregate member contributions for the year, plus state contributions for such
year, and the total cost for the year, in a manner which is authorized under the provision of
Part VII of Chapter 112, Florida Statutes, or its successor. The total cost for any year shall
be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the
unfunded past service liability over a thirty (30) year period, commencing with the fiscal
year in which the effective date of this system occurs.
(d) Other contributions. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the
fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated
bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional
benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what
would have otherwise been required city contributions.
(e) Return of overpayment member or beneficiary. Any overpayment or underpayment
from the fund to a member or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be
adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board. Overpayment shall be
charged against payments next succeeding the correction. Underpayment shall be made up
from the fund.
96/130
(f) Rollover contributions. The plan does not permit member rollover contributions, or
voluntary contributions other than the mandatory contribution required pursuant to the
plan.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2004-08, § 2, 5-18-04)
§ 16-236. Benefit amounts and eligibility.
(a) Normal retirement date. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the
month coincident with, or next following the date he attains the earlier of:
(1) Age fifty-five (55) with ten (10) or more years of credited service; or
(2) Age fifty-two (52) with twenty-five (25) years of credited service, for members who
separate from service before October 1, 1998; and
(3) Age fifty (50), with twenty-five (25) years of credited service, for members who
separate from service on or after October 1, 1998.
A member may retire on his or her normal retirement date or on the first day of any month
thereafter. Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from employment with the city
on or after the normal retirement date. Each member who retires on or after normal
retirement age shall receive a normal retirement pension.
(b) Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his or her normal
retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit consisting of a single life annuity which
shall commence on the first day of the month next following his or her retirement and be
continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with one hundred
twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit
shall equal to: (i) two and one-half (2½) percent of average final compensation, for each
year of credited service for members separating from service prior to October 1, 1998, or,
(ii) three (3) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service for
members who separate from service on or after October 1, 1998. Notwithstanding the
preceding, effective October 1. 2012, for all members who have not vet retired and/or
entered the DROP as of the enactment date of September 17, 2013, the maximum total
benefit provided by the fund shall be limited to the lesser of either: seventy-five thousand
dollars ($75,000.00) per year; or three (3) percent of average final compensation, for each
year of credited service. In no event shall the maximum total benefit provided by the fund
be less than two (2) percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited
service. Once the maximum pension benefit, as defined herein, is met, all pension
contributions made on behalf of the member will permanently cease. The retirement
income will be reduced for moneys received under the disability provisions of this plan so
that the monthly benefit shall not exceed the greater of the disability or retirement pension.
( c ) Delayed retirement. Retirement may be delayed by a member and shall not be
mandatory solely by reason of age prior to the required beginning date specified in section
16-251, hereof. The delayed retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident
with, or next following, actual retirement.
(d) Early retirement date. A member may retire on his or her early retirement date which
shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age
fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under
the plan is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date
and prior to the normal retirement date.
97/130
(e) Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his or her early retirement
date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable for
life, with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed, as follows:
(1) A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have
been the member's normal retirement date had he remained a police officer and shall be
continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred
monthly retirement benefit shall be a life annuity determined in the same manner as for
retirement at normal retirement date except that credited service and average final
compensation shall be determined as of the early retirement date; or
(2) An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on early retirement
date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable
shall be as determined in subsection (1) above, which is actuarially reduced from the
amount to which the member would have been entitled had the member retired on his
normal retirement date and with the same number of years of credited service as at the
time benefits commence and based on the member's average final compensation at that
date. In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed three (3) percent for each
year by which the member's age at retirement precedes the member's normal retirement
age.
( f ) Immediate and deferred payment of early retirement benefit. The board shall
commence payment of the immediate early retirement pension on the first day of the month
designated by the member as the annuity starting date, so long as such date follows the
member's termination of service with the city. If a member elects a deferred early
retirement pension, or fails to designate an annuity starting date, the board shall commence
payment following the member's attainment of normal retirement age.
(g) Termination benefit; generally. A member whose employment terminates for any
reason prior to becoming eligible for an early or normal retirement pension, shall receive
either a deferred pension, calculated in the manner set forth in subsection (h) of this section
16-236 herein; or a refund benefit in an amount equal to the total contributions made by
the member to the plan. A member shall only be entitled to a deferred pension if he has at
least ten (10) years of credited service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 16-
236, a member, at any time prior to the commencement of his normal retirement pension,
his early retirement pension or his deferred pension, may elect to receive a refund benefit in
lieu thereof.
(h) Amount of deferred pension. The member's deferred pension shall be a single life
annuity, with a one hundred twenty (120) month guarantee, computed in the same manner
as the early retirement pension if the member elects to begin receiving his monthly pension
before age fifty-five (55) or it shall be a single life annuity, with a one hundred twenty
(120) month guarantee, computed in the same manner as the normal retirement pension if
the member elects to begin receiving his pension on or after age fifty-five (55), with such
benefit to be determined as of the date on which his termination of employment occurs.
(i) Payment of deferred pension. A terminated member's deferred pension shall become
payable in the same manner as a normal retirement pension, or if elected by the member in
the manner provided in subsection (h) hereof, in the same manner as an early retirement
pension.
(j) Effective date of change in benefits. Members separating from service before October
1, 1998, shall only be entitled to the benefits provided by the plan prior to October 1,
1998.
98/130
(k) Deferred retirement option plan (DROP).
(1) Operation. Any member of the system who has satisfied the requirement for normal
retirement as set forth herein may elect to withdraw from the system while continuing to
be an employee of the city for a period of up to five (5) years. During this period, the
member and employer shall cease to make contributions to the fund and benefit accruals
shall cease at the date of withdrawal from the system. At the time of the withdrawal, the
member may elect any optional form of retirement income as allowed by the plan. The
amount of the monthly pension which would otherwise be paid shall be maintained as a
co-mingled DROP account(s) in the name of the member within the fund and shall be
segregated from other trust assets on a bookkeeping basis only.
a . Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive, by
designating full or partial allocation of the monthly benefit amount, either interest or
earnings on his or her accounts to be determined as provided below. The member may
elect, in writing, to change his or her election on a quarterly basis during DROP
participation. An election to change must be made at least thirty (30) days prior to the
beginning of a calendar quarter and shall be effective on the first day of the calendar
quarter immediately following such notice of election. There shall be no limit on the
number of such transfers.
1. Earnings election. Quarterly the DROP account shall share in the investment gains
and losses for the quarter at the same rate of the return earned by the total trust fund;
and/or
2. Interest election. The DROP account shall be credited interest based on the trust
fund's money market interest rate compounded quarterly.
3 . Any additional cost arising for the election of partial allocation of the monthly
benefit amount shall be paid by the member.
b. Regardless of the option selected by the participant, the board of trustees has the
right to accelerate payments in order to comply with section 401(a)(9) IRC and the
right to defer payments to comply with section 415 IRC.
(2) Termination of employment. Upon termination of employment, not later than five
(5) years following entry into the DROP program, the member shall commence receiving
the monthly benefit in the same form and amount as selected at the time of entry into the
DROP program. In addition, the member shall receive the value of his DROP account in
a single lump sum payment.
( 3 ) Continued employment. In the event that the member continues employment
following completion of the DROP period, the member shall forfeit his or her
entitlement to the accumulated assets in the DROP account, which account shall no
longer be segregated from the other assets of the plan, and such member shall deposit to
the fund an amount equal to the member contributions which would have been made had
the member continued as an active participant in the plan during the DROP period. Upon
later termination of employment, the retiring member shall receive benefit credit for
years and completed months during which he or she participated in the DROP program
and for which member contributions were subsequently made, as well as credited service
accrued before and after participation in the DROP plan.
99/130
(4) Computation of plan benefits. The benefits of a member who makes an election to
withdraw from the system while continuing to be an employee of the city, shall be
determined based upon including as salary, at the time of withdrawal, the amount of
accrued vacation and sick pay which would have been available had such member
terminated employment at the time of making the election. Notwithstanding the above,
payments made to a withdrawing member's DROP account shall be reduced by the
product obtained by multiplying the then applicable member contribution rate by the
amount of accrued vacation pay and sick pay which is includible in the above calculation.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2000-13, § 2, 9-5-00; Ord. No. 2002-02, § 2,
5-21-02; Ord. No. 2004-08, § 2, 5-18-04; Ord. No. 2010-16, § 1, 10-19-10; Ord. No.
2013-15, § 2, 9-17-13)
§ 16-237. Disability.
(a) Disability benefits in-duty. Each police officer who is a member in the system and who
shall have become totally and permanently disabled, while actively employed as a police
officer with the city, to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable
physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer,
and which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer
shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly
pension equal to either, (i) two and one-half (2½) percent of his or her compensation for a
member separating from service prior to October 1, 1998, or (ii) three (3) percent of his or
her compensation for a member separating from service on or after October 1, 1998,
multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid
to the member shall be forty-two (42) percent of the member's compensation. For the
purposes of this paragraph, compensation shall be deemed to be the greater of the
member's average compensation based upon his or her pay status at the time the disability
occurred or his or her average final compensation.
(1) Any condition or impairment of health of a police officer caused by tuberculosis,
hypertension, hardening of the arteries, or heart disease resulting in total or partial
disability or death shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty unless the
contrary is shown by competent evidence; provided, that such police officer shall have
successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including a
cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and
provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a
policy of life insurance or disability insurance.
( 2 ) The presumption provided for in this paragraph (2) shall apply only to those
conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1,
1996.
a. Definitions. As used in this paragraph (2), the following definitions apply:
1 . "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other
body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational
transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease
Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis
or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids,
including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which
infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons.
100/130
2. "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed fulltime
by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law
enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a
high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or
tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the
term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person
employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395, or any person employed by
a subsidiary thereof.
3 . "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B,
hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical
community.
4. "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a
person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties
associated with his or her employment:
i. Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-healthcare setting where there is
a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons;
ii. At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an
emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of
containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments
exposed to body fluids;
iii. Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected
law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or
i v. Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of
prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while
on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing
such duties, may be exposed to body fluids.
5 . "Occupation exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or
tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties
that may place a worker at risk of infection.
b . Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a
condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal
meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or
partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of
duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be
entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. §
92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief:
1. In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not:
i . Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have
sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his
employment;
i i . Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion
arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present
employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation
disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to
indicate the presence of hepatitis;
101/130
iii. Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by
the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had
sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual
practices or other high-risk behavior; or
iv. Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician.
2 . In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately
preceding diagnosis he or she was not exposed, outside the scope of his or her
employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be
an asymptomatic carrier of the disease.
3. In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative
tuberculosis skin test, he or she has not been exposed, outside the scope of his or her
employment, to any person known by him or her to have tuberculosis.
c. Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form
of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease
for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the
given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency
rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the
immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that
the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's
health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or
public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the
member from the benefits of the presumption.
d. Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonable
suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to
the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such
exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or
accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational
exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis.
e . Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the
presumption provided by this section:
1 . An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have
undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable
disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions
derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This
paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis.
2. On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be
required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for any
evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis.
102/130
(b) Disability benefits off-duty. Every police officer who is a member in the system with
ten (10) years or more credited service who shall have become totally and permanently
disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or
mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which
disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer, shall be
entitled to a monthly pension equal to either: (i) two and one-half (2½) percent of
compensation for a member separating from service prior to October 1, 1998, or (ii) three
(3) percent of compensation for a member separating from service on or after October 1,
1998, multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum
amount paid to the member shall be twenty-five (25) percent of his compensation. This
provision shall not apply to a member who has reached early or normal retirement age. Any
disability occurring after termination shall not constitute a basis for disability payments.
For the purposes of this paragraph, compensation shall be deemed to be the greater of the
member's average compensation based upon his or her pay status at the time the disability
occurred or his or her average final compensation.
( c ) Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each police officer who is claiming
disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability or
death was not occasioned primarily by:
(1) Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics.
(2) Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or
civil insurrections.
(3) Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime.
(4) Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces.
(5) Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police officer with the city shall
have terminated.
(6) A condition preexisting the police officer's membership in the system. No member
shall be entitled to a disability pension because of or due to the aggravation of a specific
injury, impairment or other medical condition preexisting at the time of membership in
the system; provided, that such preexisting condition and its relationship to a later injury,
impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence.
Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after
membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition
different from some other injury, impairment or other medical condition existing at or
prior to said membership.
(d) Physical examination requirement. A police officer shall not become eligible for
disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified
physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for
that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this
purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable
and prudent to do so.
103/130
Any police officer receiving disability benefits under provisions of this section shall be
periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons,
who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such a disability has ceased to exist. If
the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent
that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall
recommend to the city that the disability retirement income be discontinued and the retiree
be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall
enjoy the same rights that member had at the time he was placed upon pension.
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the police officer claiming
and/or receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the board of this system. All other
reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as,
but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the
board.
If the police officer recovers from disability and re-enters the service of the city as a police
officer his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with
the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending
with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service
for the purposes of the plan.
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all
disability claims.
(e) Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of
the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after
the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be
payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a
partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be:
(1) If the police officer recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date,
the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or
(2) If the police officer dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal
retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the one
hundred twentieth monthly payment, whichever is later.
(3) Any monthly retirement income payments due after the death of a disabled police
officer shall be paid to the police officer's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries as
provided in F.S. §§ 185.162 and 185.21.

§ 16-238. Pre-retirement death.
104/130
(a) Prior to eligibility for deferred benefit or retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased
member who was not receiving monthly benefits, or who was not yet eligible for a deferred
benefit under subsection (g) of section 16-236, early retirement or normal retirement, shall
receive a refund of one hundred (100) percent of the member's accumulated contribution,
or in the event an annuity or life insurance contract has been purchased by the board on
such police officer, then the beneficiary shall receive instead the death benefits available
under such contract, subject to the limitations on such benefits set forth in F.S. § 185.061,
whichever amount is greater.
(b) Deceased members eligible for deferred benefit or retirement benefit. The beneficiary
of any member who dies and who, at the date of his or her death was eligible for a deferred
benefit under subsection (g) of section 16-236, or early retirement, or normal retirement,
shall be entitled to a benefit as follows:
(1) If the member was eligible for a deferred benefit, but not eligible for normal or early
retirement, the beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on
the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal
retirement, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal
retirement based on the deceased member's, date of birth. Credited service and average
final compensation as of the date of his or her death and reduced as for early retirement,
if applicable. The beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for
ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits
prior to the early retirement date.
(2) If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary
shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month
following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal retirement
date, at the option of the beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal
retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final
compensation as of the date of his or her death and reduced as for early retirement, if
applicable.
(3) A beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to
receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions.
(c) Optional death benefit for members killed in line of duty. In lieu of the benefits
described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section 16-238, the surviving spouse of any
member who dies as a direct result of an occurrence arising in the performance of service,
or if there is no surviving spouse, the legal guardian of the youngest living child, may elect
a benefit payable as follows:
(1) To the spouse, a monthly benefit payable until death equal to fifty (50) percent of the
member's average final compensation.
(2) To each minor child, in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to ten (10)
percent of the member's average final compensation, subject to a limitation of a total of
eighty (80) percent of average final compensation for the spouse and children combined.
Each child's pension shall terminate at death or upon attaining eighteen (18) years of age,
unless such child continues to be a full-time student at an accredited institution of higher
learning or at an accredited institution providing vocational or technical training, in
which case such payments may continue until such child attains the age of twenty-one
(21).
105/130
Upon death of the spouse, the allowance for each child shall be paid in trust or as
otherwise determined by the board, to eligible children, not to exceed a combined total
of fifty (50) percent of the member's average final compensation. The manner of
handling and administering the pension to any child or children shall be determined by
the board. No survivor pension shall be paid to any stepchild of a deceased member
who had not been legally adopted by such member.
(3) There shall be in any event a minimum total service-incurred death benefit equal in
amount to four (4) times the member's average final compensation. If such amount has
not yet been paid in total at such time as benefits cease under subsections (c)(1) and (c)
(2) above, then the balance shall be payable in a lump sum to the member's designated
beneficiary, and if there be none, then to such member's estate.
(4) Notwithstanding the above, neither a surviving spouse, nor minor children may elect
the optional death benefit described in this subsection (c) if the member has designated
someone other than his spouse as his beneficiary.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98)
§ 16-239. Optional forms of benefits.
(a) In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal,
early, or delayed retirement, or deferred pension, as specified herein, a member, upon
written request to the board, which request shall be retained by the board, may elect to
receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance
with one (1) of the following options:
(1) A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the member for his or
her lifetime only.
(2) A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the member during
the lifetime of the member, and following the death of the member, one hundred (100)
percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (662/3) percent, or fifty (50)
percent of such monthly amounts payable to a joint pensioner for his or her lifetime.
Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his or her spouse, the present value of
payments to the retiree shall not be less than fifty (50) percent of the total present value
of payments to the retiree and his or her joint pensioner.
(3) An actuarially equivalent larger monthly amount, with a reduction in the monthly
amount when the member's social security benefits are estimated to start so that the
member's total monthly benefit, inclusive of social security benefits, will remain
constant upon the starting date of his social security benefits.
106/130
(b) The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner
(subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any,
payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change
such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one
(1) or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with
a joint pensioner or beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have
commenced, the member may thereafter change his or her designated beneficiary up to two
(2) times and may change his or her joint pensioner up to two (2) times without the
approval of the board or the current designated survivor. The retiree member need not
provide proof of the good health of the designated survivor being removed, and the
designated survivor being removed need not be living. Provided that in the absence of
proof of good health, the actuary will assume that the designated survivor being removed
has deceased for purposes of calculating the new benefit payment.
(c) The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change
shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive
benefits under the system shall thereupon cease.
( d) Upon change of a retiree's beneficiary or joint pensioner in accordance with this
section, the board shall adjust the retiree's monthly benefit by application of actuarial
calculations to insure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the retiree's then
current benefit. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall
make repayment of any overage of previously paid pension benefits as a result of said
recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the
board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated
beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the
retiree subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid as provided in section 16-240
(e) Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with
the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations:
(1) If a member dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date,
whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any
person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 16-238
(2 ) If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the
member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically
and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member
upon his or her retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is
made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated
by the member prior to his or her retirement.
(3) If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or
retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for
payment for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of
subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the
remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 16-240
107/130
(4) If a member continues beyond his or her normal retirement date pursuant to the
provisions of section 16-236, and dies prior to his or her actual retirement and while an
option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement
income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a
beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts
computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his or her
death occurred.
(f) Except as set forth in subsection (b), hereof, a retiree may not change his or her
retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his or her first retirement check.
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to
make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the
total commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the
power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a
complete discharge of all obligations under the system with the regard to such member and
shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
persons.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2010-09, § 3, 5-4-10; Ord. No. 2012-12, § 1,
8-21-12)
§ 16-240. Beneficiaries.
(a) Beneficiary designation. A member may from time to time designate a beneficiary in
writing, or change such designation of, any person or persons, contingently or successively,
to whom the trustee shall pay the remainder of his benefit in the event of his death. The
board shall prescribe the form for the written designation of beneficiary and, upon the
member's filing the form with the board, it effectively shall revoke all designations filed
prior to that date by the same member. This subsection (a) shall not supersede the
provisions of subsection (b) of section 16-239
(b) No beneficiary designation. If a member fails to name a beneficiary in accordance with
the preceding subsection, or if the beneficiary named by a member predeceases him or her,
or dies before complete distribution of the member's benefit, then the board shall pay the
member's remaining benefit, if any, to the member's estate.

EDITOR'S NOTE
Ord. No. 2010-25, §§ 2, 3, adopted Oct. 19, 2010 repealed former §§ 16-245, 16-246 in their
entirety and sequentially numbered the remaining sections of this article. Former § 16-245
pertained to the maximum pension, and former section 16-246 pertained to the latest date to
begin distribution of benefits. Both former § 16-245 and former § 16-246 derived from Ord.
No. 98-19, § 2, adopted Oct. 20, 1998.
§ 16-245. Repeal or termination of plan and distribution of fund.
(a) The article establishing the plan and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said
plan and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part for any reason
or because of a transfer, merger, or consolidation of governmental units, services, or
functions as provided in chapter 121; provided that if this or any subsequent article shall be
amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of
benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued
to the member or beneficiary shall be nonforfeitable.
(b) If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, the
board shall continue to administer the plan in accordance with the provisions of this
article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement
allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options
provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of
repeal, or if contributions to the plan are discontinued, there shall be full vesting (one
hundred (100) percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the plan shall
be distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value
required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits to be distributed, after taking into account
the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the municipality if additional
assets are required, in which event the municipality shall continue to financially support
the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded.
(2) The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value,
that is, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or
substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each
member entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3).
(3) The board of trustees shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in
the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide
any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such
retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection
(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given
retirement income is shall mean the single premium payable for such annuity. The
actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the member's accumulated contributions
to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits
previously paid to the employee.
113/130
(4) If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3),
and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall
be returned to the municipality less return to the state of the state's contributions,
provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the municipality
and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided
proportionately to the total contributions made by the municipality and the state.
(5) The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts
determined apportioned under subsection (3).
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board
received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently
discontinued, the municipality or special fire control district or the board of trustees of the
firefighters' pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this
section, the Department of Management Services shall effect the termination of the fund in
accordance with this section.

alienate (either at law or in equity) any benefit provided under the plan, and the trustees
shall not recognize any such anticipation, assignment or alienation. Furthermore, a benefit
under the plan is not subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or
equitable process; except the recipient of any monthly benefit may authorize the board of
trustees to withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits
being received from the city and/or for benefits being received by the retiree from the
certified bargaining unit, and to make any payments for child support, alimony, and to pay
for accident, health, and long-term care insurance premiums for the recipient, the
recipient's spouse and the recipient's dependents. The Pension Fund shall not incur any

§ 16-251. Internal Revenue Code Compliance.
(a) Maximum pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this plan to the contrary, the
annual pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant shall not exceed the dollar
limitation set forth below. If the benefit the participant would otherwise accrue in a
limitation year would produce an annual pension in excess of the dollar limitation, the
benefit shall be limited to a benefit that does not exceed the dollar limitation.
(1) Definitions Used in this section.
a . "Annual pension" means the benefits received by a participant under this plan
expressed in the form of a straight life annuity. In determining whether benefits payable
exceed the dollar limitation set forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a
straight life annuity shall be adjusted to the larger of:
(i) The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the participant
under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit
payable to the participant; or
116/130
(ii) The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity
starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable
to the participant, computed using a 5 percent interest assumption and the applicable
mortality table described in §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting date.
No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for benefits that are not
directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit,
preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits); or the
inclusion in the form of benefit of an automatic benefit increase feature, provided
the form of benefit is not subject to § 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and
would otherwise satisfy the limitations of this Subsection (a), and the amount
payable under the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits
of this Subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in
subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an automatic
benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the form of benefit
provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits paid in that form.
b . "Dollar limitation" means one hundred sixty thousand dollars ($160,000.00)
(subject to the annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said
amount shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as
follows:
(i) Except with respect to a participant who is a "Qualified Participant" as defined in
Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for benefits (except survivor and disability
benefits as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age sixtytwo
(62) the age-adjusted dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of:
1 . The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as
a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62), where annual
payments under the straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two (62) are
equal to the dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the
limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
computed using a five-percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under
§ 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the
participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting
date); and
2. The dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) multiplied by the
ratio of the annual amount of the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual
amount of the straight life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both
annual amounts determined without applying the rules of section 415.
(ii) For benefits beginning after the age of sixty-five (65), the age-adjusted dollar
limitation is equal to the lesser of:
117/130
1 . The actuarial equivalent of the annual amount of a straight life annuity
commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as
a straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five (65), where annual payments
under the straight life annuity commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar
limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the
limitation year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is
computed using a five-percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under
§ 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and expressing the
participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting
date); and
2 . The Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limitation (as adjusted pursuant to Section
415(d) and §1.415(d)-1 for the limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the
annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under
the plan to the adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity. The adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity means the annual amount of the
immediately commencing straight life annuity payable to the participant, computed
disregarding the participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including
actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset
accruals. For this purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing
straight life annuity is determined without applying the rules of Section 415. The
adjusted age sixty-five (65) straight life annuity means the annual amount of the
straight life annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical
participant who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial
increases for commencement after age sixty-five (65) as the participant receiving
the distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age sixtyfive
(65) and without applying the rules of Section 415).
(iii) There shall be no age adjustment of the dollar Limitation with respect to benefits
beginning between the ages of sixty-two (62) and sixty-five (65).
(2) The limitations set forth in this subsection (a) shall not apply if the annual pension
does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) provided the participant has never
participated in a defined contribution plan maintained by the city.
(3) Cost-of-living adjustments in the dollar limitation for benefits shall be limited to
scheduled annual increases determined by the Secretary of the Treasury under Subsection
415(d) of the Code.
(4) In the case of a participant who has fewer than ten (10) years of participation in the
plan, the dollar limitation set forth in Paragraph (1)b. of this subsection (a) shall be
multiplied by a fraction(i) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part
thereof) of participation in the plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.
(5 ) Any portion of a participant's benefit that is attributable to mandatory employee
contributions (unless picked-up by the city) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into
account in the manner prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code.
(6) Should any participant participate in more than one defined benefit plan maintained
by the City, in any case in which the participant's benefits under all such defined benefit
plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the dollar limitation applicable at
that age, the accrual of the participant's benefit under this plan shall be reduced so that
the participant's combined benefits will equal the dollar limitation.
118/130
(7) For a participant who has or will have distributions commencing at more than one
(1) annuity starting date, the annual benefit shall be determined as of each such annuity
starting date (and shall satisfy the limitations of this section as of each such date),
actuarially adjusting for past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the
other annuity starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new
starting date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d),
and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax Regulations.
(8) The determination of the annual pension under paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection (a)
shall take into account (in the manner prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of
the Code) social security supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue
Code and benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers of
distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax Regulations.
(9) The above limitations are intended to comply with the provisions of Section 415 of
the Code, as amended, so that the maximum benefits provided by plans of the city shall
be exactly equal to the maximum amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and
regulations thereunder. If there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this
subsection (a) and the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder,
such discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the provisions of
Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as a result of the application
of this subsection (a) shall be used to decrease future employer contributions.
(b) Required beginning date: Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, payment of
a participant's retirement benefits under the plan shall commence not later than the
participant's required beginning date, which is defined as the later of:
( 1 ) April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the
participant attains or will attain the age of seventy and one-half (70½) years; or
( 2 ) April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in which the
participant retires.
(c) Required minimum distributions.
(1 ) Required beginning date. The participant's entire interest will be distributed, or
begin to be distributed, to the participant no later than the participant's required
beginning date as defined in subsection (b) of this section 16-251
(2) Death of participant before distributions begin.
a. If the participant dies before distributions begin, the participant's entire interest will
be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
(i) If the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar
year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by
December 31 of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age
seventy and one-half (70½), if later.
(ii) If the participant's surviving spouse is not the participant's sole designated
beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December
31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the
participant died.
119/130
(iii) If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the
year of the participant's death, the participant's entire interest will be distributed by
December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's
death.
b. The participant's entire interest shall be distributed as follows:
(i) Participant survived by designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the
date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the
participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time
described in subparagraph (2)a. above, over the life of the designated beneficiary or
over a period certain not exceeding:
1. Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the
life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age
as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year of the participant's death; or
2. If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life
expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as
of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting
date.
(ii) No designated beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distributions
begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following
the year of the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest will
be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of
the participant's death.
c. Death of surviving spouse before distributions to surviving spouse begin. In any case
in which (i) the participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins,
(ii) the participant's surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary,
and (iii) the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin,
subparagraphs (2)a. and (2)b. above shall apply as though the surviving spouse were
the participant.
( 3 ) Requirements for annuity distributions that commence during participant's
lifetime.
a . Joint life annuities where the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse. If the
participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for
the joint lives of the participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be
made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary
after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the
annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using
the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If
the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
participant and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement
in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated
beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
120/130
b . Period certain annuities. Unless the participant's spouse is the sole designated
beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the
period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime
may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform
Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes
the year in which the participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution
period for the participant is the distribution period for age 70 under the Uniform
Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the
excess of seventy (70) over the age of the participant as of the participant's birthday in
the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the
participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain
and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the participant's
applicable distribution period, as determined under this subparagraph (3)b., or the joint
life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and the participant's spouse as
determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9
of the Treasury regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the
participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity
starting date.
(4) Form of distribution. Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an
annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the
required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be
made in accordance with subparagraphs (4)a., (4)b. and (4)c. below. If the participant's
interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section
401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the participant's interest
which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code
will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the
Code and the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts.
a . General annuity requirements. If the participant's interest is paid in the form of
annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the
following requirements:
(i) The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not
longer than one (1) year;
(ii) The distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain, not
longer than the distribution period described in paragraphs (2) or (3) above,
whichever is applicable, of this subsection (c);
(iii) Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be
changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted;
(iv) Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:
1 . By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage
increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
121/130
2 . To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the participant's payments to
provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life
was being used to determine the distribution period dies or is no longer the
participant's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the
meaning of Section 414(p) of the Code;
3. To provide cash refunds of employee contributions upon the participant's death;
or
4. To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment.
b. Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must
be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the
participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin
under subparagraph (2)a.(i) or (2)a.(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment that is
required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the
end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar
year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bimonthly,
monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals
as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the
calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or
after the participant's required beginning date.
c . Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits
accruing to the participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year
will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
(5 ) For purposes of this subsection (c), distributions are considered to begin on the
participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the
participant (or to the participant's surviving spouse) before the participant's required
beginning date (or, if to the participant's surviving spouse, before the date distributions
are required to begin in accordance with subparagraph (2)a. above), the date distributions
are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
(6) Definitions.
a. Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under
the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and
Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.
b. Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is
required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first
distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year
which contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning
after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in
which distributions are required to begin pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection
(c).
c . Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in
Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.
(d)

122/130
Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a
distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the
manner prescribed by the administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a
direct rollover.
(2) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:
a. Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of
all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible
rollover distribution does not include:
(i) Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments
(not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the
distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or
more;
(ii) Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)
(9) of the Code;
(iii) The portion of any distribution that is a hardship distribution described in
Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code; and
(iv) The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities), provided that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an
eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax
Employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such
portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined contribution
plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately
account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion
of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includible.
(3 ) Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement
account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity
described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of
the Code, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust
described in Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the
Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to
separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan, or, with respect
to distributions on or after January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of
Code Section 408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution.
123/130
(4) Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the
employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former
employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with
regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1,
2007, a surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the Code
who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an individual
retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an individual retirement
annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall be considered a distributee.
(5) Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement
plan specified by the distributee.
( e ) Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, the maximum amount of any
mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, payable under the
plan shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
( f ) Compensation Limitations Under 401(a)(17): In addition to other applicable
limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the
contrary, the annual compensation of each participant taken into account under the plan
shall not exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning

thousand dollars ($200,000.00), as adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost
of living in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living

2, 3, 10-19-10)
§ 16-255. Miscellaneous provisions.
125/130
(a) Interest of members in plan. At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any
part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than
for their exclusive benefit.
(b) No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the
city commission which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of
members or a member's beneficiaries.
(c) Qualification of plan. It is intended that the plan will constitute a qualified public
pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code, as now in effect or hereafter
amended. Any modification or amendment of the plan shall apply retroactively, if necessary
or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the plan in meeting the requirements of the
applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other
applicable provisions of the United States federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter
amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder.
(d) Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall
serve only to reduce future city contributions.
(e) Discharge of members. Members entitled to a benefit shall not forfeit the same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall retain entitlement as herein described.
(f) Incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the
board, otherwise incapable of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any
payment due him under the plan, the board may, unless and until claims shall have been
made by a duly appointed guardian of such person, make such payment or any part thereof
to such person's spouse, children, or other person deemed by the board to have incurred
expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person. Any payment so made
shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan for such payment.
(g) Personal data to board. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
must furnish to the board such evidence, data or information as the board considers
necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the plan. The provisions of this plan
are effective for the benefit of each member upon the condition precedent that each
member will furnish promptly full, true and complete evidence, data and information when
requested by the board, provided the board shall advise each member of the effect of his
failure to comply with its request.
(h) Address for notification. Each member and each beneficiary of a deceased member
shall file with the board from time to time, in writing, his post office address and any
change of post office address. Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a
member, or beneficiary, at his last post office address filed with the board, or as shown on
the records of the city, shall bind the member, or beneficiary, for all purposes of this plan.
(i) Word usage. Words used in the masculine shall apply to the feminine where applicable,
and wherever the context of the plan dictates, the plural shall be read as the singular and the
singular as the plural.
( j ) State law. Florida law shall determine all questions arising with respect to the
provisions of this plan except to the extent federal statute supersedes state law.
126/130
(k) Employment not guaranteed. Nothing contained in this plan, or with respect to the
establishment of the trust, or any modification or amendment to the plan or trust, or in the
creation of any account, or the payment of any benefit, shall give any employee, employeemember
or any beneficiary any right to continue employment, any legal or equitable right
against the city, or employee of the city, or against the trustee, or its agents or employees,
or against the plan administrator, except as expressly provided by the plan, the trust, the act
or by a separate agreement.
(l) Waiver of notice. Any person entitled to notice under the plan may waive the notice.
(m) Successors. The plan shall be binding upon all persons entitled to benefits under the
plan, their respective heirs and legal representatives, upon the city, its successors and
assigns, and upon the trustee, the board, the plan administrator and their successors.
(n) Unclaimed account procedure.
(1) The plan does not require either the board to search for, or ascertain the whereabouts
of, any member or beneficiary. The board, by certified or registered mail addressed to his
last known address of record with the board or the city, shall notify any member, or
beneficiary, that he is entitled to a distribution under this plan, and the notice shall quote
the provisions of this section. If the member, or beneficiary, fails to claim his distributive
share or make his whereabouts known in writing to the board within six (6) months from
the date of mailing of the notice, or before the termination or discontinuance of this plan,
whichever should first occur, the board shall treat the member's or beneficiary's
unclaimed payable accrued benefit as forfeited. The city shall use the amounts
representing the forfeited accrued benefit to reduce its contribution for future plan years.
(2) If a member or beneficiary who has incurred a forfeiture of his accrued benefit under
the provisions of paragraph (1) above makes a claim, at any time, for his forfeited
accrued benefit, the board shall restore the member's or beneficiary's forfeited accrued
benefit. The board shall direct the distribution of the member's or beneficiary's accrued
benefit. The board shall direct the distribution of the member's or beneficiary's accrued
benefit as if the member's employment terminated in the plan year in which the board
restored the forfeited benefit.
( o ) Co-mingling of investments. The board for collective investment purposes, may
combine into one (1) trust fund the trust created under this plan with the trust created
under any other qualified retirement plan the city maintains. However, the board shall
maintain separate records of account for each trust in order to reflect properly each
member's accrued benefit under the plan(s) in which he is a member.
(p) Miscellaneous provisions affecting payment of benefits generally. In general, the
board shall make payment of any pension directly to the member entitled to the payment.
However, the board, in lieu of paying the pension which a member is to receive directly
from the fund, may purchase from an insurance company selected by the board, a
nontransferable annuity contract. The nontransferable annuity contract must provide
pension and other benefits in an amount not less than the pension and other benefits a
member would receive under this plan, and must satisfy all consent and distribution
requirements prescribed by the plan. In the event the board purchase a nontransferable
annuity contract for the benefit of a member, the board may either assign the contract to the
member or hold the contract for the benefit of the member pursuant to the instructions of
the board. The board also may purchase a nontransferable annuity contract for the benefit
of a designated beneficiary or surviving spouse entitled to distribution of all or a portion
of the member's nonforfeitable accrued benefit.
127/130
( q ) No responsibility for city action. The board shall not have any obligation nor
responsibility with respect to any action required by the plan to be taken by the city, any
member, nor for the failure of any of the above persons to act or make any payment or
contribution, or to otherwise provide any benefit contemplated under this plan, nor shall
the board be required to collect any contribution required under the plan, or determine the
correctness of the amount of any city contribution. The board need not inquire into or be
responsible for any action or failure to act on the part of the others.
(r) No liability. The city assumes no obligation or responsibility to any of its employees,
members or beneficiaries for any act of, or failure to act, on the part of the board.
(s) Statutory preemption. In the event of any conflict with the provisions of this plan, the
provisions of F.S. ch. 185 shall control to the extent of any such conflict.
(t) Statutory amendment. Any and all amendments to F.S. ch. 185, the compliance of
which are necessary for the continued participation of the plan under F.S. ch. 185, are
hereby adopted by reference as if made by the city.
(Ord. No. 98-19, § 2, 10-20-98; Ord. No. 2010-25, §§ 2, 3, 10-19-10)
§ 16-256. Defined Contribution Component Supplemental Retirement
Benefit.
Effective: Tuesday, December 06, 2016
(a) There is hereby provided, in addition to all other benefits provided in this Article, a defined contribution component supplemental
retirement benefit. The defined contribution component supplemental retirement benefit shall consist of an individual share account for
each Member of the Plan, including DROP participants. The supplemental retirement benefit shall be funded solely by premium tax
revenues in excess of the 2013 frozen amount received by the city pursuant to F.S. Ch. 185, as provided for by the City of Lake Wales Code
of Ordinances. Effective October 1, 2016, fifty percent (50%) of the premium tax revenues received by the City in excess of the 2013 frozen
amount shall be allocated to Members share accounts as provided for herein with the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the premium tax
revenue received by the City to be used at the discretion of the City toward current year benefits (either defined benefit or defined
contribution), as an immediate reduction of unfunded actuarial liability (UAL) balance, or reserved as a prepaid sponsor contribution
toward future required funding. Member share accounts shall be credited with premium tax revenues and investment earnings and losses
and account distributions as outlined herein.
(b) Annual crediting. Effective January 1, 2017, and each January 1 thereafter, the share account of each Member and DROP participant on
the Citys payroll as of the preceding September 30TH shall be credited as follows. Each Member and DROP participant who was
employed on the preceding September 30TH shall receive one share for each complete year and fractional part of years of Credited
Service, as defined in section 16-231, determined as of the end of the Plan year ending on the same September 30TH. The total number
of shares thus determined shall be divided into the total premium tax revenues received during that plan year to determine the amount to
be credited to the share account of each eligible share plan participant.
(c) Investment earnings and losses. Effective January 1, 2017, and each January 1 thereafter, the share account of each Member and
DROP participant shall be credited or debited with earnings or losses based upon the amount in the share account at the beginning of the
immediately preceding fiscal year at a rate equal to the Plans actual net rate of investment return for such fiscal year. Share accounts shall
be commingled in the Fund and invested as with any other Fund asset. Share accounts shall be segregated into individual member
accounts on a bookkeeping basis only. Alternatively, effective upon adoption, instead of the "net investment return" as set forth above, each
Member may direct a one-time irrevocable election at any time prior to separation from service that his or her Share account be invested in
a money market fund as may be made available from time to time by the board. The electing member's Share account shall be credited or
debited at a rate equal to the net rate of investment return realized by such money market fund.
128/130
(d) Distribution of share accounts. A Member or DROP participant with ten or more years of credited service upon termination of
employment and eligibility for receipt of pension benefits shall be eligible to receive a distribution of the balance in his or her share
account, together with all earnings and losses credited or debited to the share account through the date of termination of employment. No
supplemental retirement benefit shall be payable to a Member who terminates covered employment with less than ten years of Credited
Service. The share account balances of such non-vested terminated Members shall be redistributed among all eligible participants share
accounts in the same manner as premium tax revenues in the following calendar year. The designated beneficiary of a Member who dies
having accumulated ten or more years of Credited Service shall receive the accumulated total of the Members share account balance.
There shall be no forfeiture of a Members share account based on the Members death, disability, or termination of employment with ten
or more years of Credited Service. Payment of share account benefits shall be by lump sum, which shall consist of the accumulated total
balance of a Members share account, or, at the Members direction, the share account balance may be rolled over to another qualified
plan in accordance with section 16-251 of this Plan. One additional payment or rollover will be made on the January 1 following
termination of employment for any supplemental retirement benefit amount credited for the Members year of termination.

when utility services are supplied thereto. Contract fees will only apply to actual services rendered per
residence. "Actual Service" will be linked to the status of utility service at the residence; i.e., utility service
disconnected for any reason are not considered to be "active". However residents on "vacation status" will

considered to be "active" or on vacation status shall be billed for solid waste collection, recycling, and
disposal services.
Payments to the Contractor will be made on a monthly basis with the first payment made by the 20th of the
month following the monthly billing cycle. The first billing cycle will be November 2018 for October
2018 services. The first payment due date will be December 20, 2018. Payments will be made in

is greater than 2.5% but in no event shall the total increase exceed 3%.
(Ord. No. 2018-02, § 1, 02-20-2018)
NOTATION
Note: Roll off customers rates are based on negotiated contract between Contractor and the customer.
§ 2-3. Residential Payments.
Effective: Tuesday, February 20, 2018
Payments shall be calculated based on fixed per customer rate multiplied by the pro-rated number of City
active residential solid waste customers. "Actual Service" will be linked to the status of utility service at the
residence; with or plus the number of residential solid waste customers on "vacation status" billed at the 25%
vacancy rate.
The rates shall be adjusted annually on each anniversary date beginning October 1st to reflect an increase
based on based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (Water, Sewer and Trash collection
Services) or two and one-half percent (2.5%), whichever is greater, but not to exceed three percent
(3%)without further need for Commission action. In addition, should the price of diesel fuel increase or
decrease by an extraordinary rate of ten percent (10%) of the base rate of $2.75 per gallon, the Contractor or
the City may petition and shall be granted a pass through cost increase or decrease based on monthly gallons
used and difference in price to be calculated and allocated per customer per month. Should the fuel cost not
exceed the ten percent (10%) threshold, the rate would be adjusted via the CPI. Should the fuel cost have to
be adjusted upward, that portion will be removed from the CPI calculation. Should the fuel cost fall below
$2.75 per gallon, the CPI calculation will be lowered for the fuel cost portion. Example: If a fuel cost
adjustment is required and fuel cost represents ten percent (10%) of the Contractor's operating budget then
the CPI will be reduced ten percent (10%) before the fuel cost adjustment is added or if the fuel cost falls
below $2.75 per gallon the CPI-will be reduced the ten percent (10%).
The same formula will apply to the Commercial customers. The fuel cost will be calculated and allocated per
cubic yard.

commission is satisfied that any such street lighting assessment is so irregular or defective
that it cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city commission has omitted any property
on the assessment roll, which property should have been so included, the city commission
may take all necessary steps to impose a new street lighting assessment against any property
benefited by the street lighting assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable the
provisions of this article; and if such second street lighting assessment is annulled, vacated
or set aside, the city commission may obtain and impose other street lighting assessments
until a valid street lighting assessment is imposed.
(Ord. No. 2010-10, § 1, 5-18-10)
§ 17.5-16. Procedural irregularities.

assessment after its approval, and any street lighting assessment as finally approved shall be
competent and sufficient evidence that such street lighting assessment was duly levied, that
the street lighting assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings
adequate to such street lighting assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required
by this article; and no variance from these directions shall be held material unless it be

manager, city commission, their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or
discharge any obligation for payment of a street lighting assessment imposed by the city
commission under the provision of this article.
(b) When it shall appear that any street lighting assessment should have been imposed
under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of street
lighting services, facilities or programs, but that such property was omitted from the
assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the
effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any
upcoming fiscal year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail
provided to the owner of the omitted parcel in the manner and form provided in section
17.5-10, impose the applicable street lighting assessment for the fiscal year in which such
error is discovered, in addition to the applicable street lighting assessment due for the prior
two fiscal years. Such street lighting assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed
property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal
taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens,
mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved; shall be
collected; and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing
the omitted or delinquent assessments.
(c) Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time,
upon his own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any
property subject to a street lighting assessment, to reclassify property based upon
presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the
street lighting assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not
otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way
affect the enforcement of the street lighting assessment imposed under the provisions of
this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications
or corrections shall be referred to and processed by the city manager and not the property
appraiser or tax collector.
(d) After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections shall be
made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on
the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager.

expenses attributable to such assessment, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform

(Ord. No. 2017-01, § 3, 02-07-2017)
§ 18-56. Intent and purpose.
Effective: Tuesday, February 07, 2017
The City Commission finds and declares that:
(1) Findings.
a. The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in public rights- of-way
present an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using such rightsof-
way; including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, and
persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services.
b. Newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public
rights-of-way, and unsightly newsracks located thereon, constitute public nuisances.
c. These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use
of public rights-of-way, are injurious to health, offensive to the senses, and constitute such
an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of
life and property by the entire community.
d. The City Commission recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of- way is so
historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that
access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The City
Commission further finds that it is in the public interest to provide newsracks within a
designated area set forth in this article to accommodate such interests regulating the time,
place and manner of using such City supplied newsracks.
(2 ) Purpose. The provisions and prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted are in
pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, safety, and
general welfare of persons in the City in their use of public rights-of-way within the
designated area through the regulation of placement, appearance, number, size, and
servicing of newsracks on the public rights-of- way so as to:
a. Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;
b. Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic,
including ingress to, or egress from, any place of business or from the street to the
sidewalk;
c. Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts,
traffic signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes and similar appurtenances, and access to
locations used for public transportation purposes;
d. Reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way, protect the aesthetics and value of
surrounding properties;
10/43
e. Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and
litigation; and
f. Protect the right to distribute information protected by the federal and state
constitutions through use of newsracks.
(3) Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this article to in any way
discriminate against, regulate, or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or
dissemination of any printed material that is constitutionally protected.

laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations
(40 CFR Part 403) as from time to time amended.
(b) The objectives of this article are to:
(1) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal sewer system which will
interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal sewer system which will
pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3) Improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim waste water and sludge from the
system; and
(4) Provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal sewer system.
12/68

any sewer line exists within five hundred (500) feet of the subject property which is
accessible via easements or rights-of-way.
(3) Areas zoned or used for industrial or manufacturing purposes or the equivalent.
Service is available if a sewer line exists within one-fourth (¼) mile (one thousand three
hundred twenty (1,320) feet) of the development which is accessible via easements or
rights-of-way. Where a building exists on a septic system prior to June 1, 1996, service
is deemed to be available if the connection can be made without unreasonable cost to the
property owner. For repair or modification of a preexisting septic system, service is
deemed to be available if any sewer line exists within five hundred (500) feet of the
subject property which is accessible via easements or rights-of-way.
13/68
(b) Mandatory connection. Where service is deemed to be available, the owner of each lot
or parcel of land within the city's utility service area upon which any building exists that is
used for residential, institutional, commercial or industrial purposes shall cause the
plumbing of such building to be connected with the sewer system and use such facilities
within sixty (60) days following notification to do so by the director of utilities. All such
connections shall be made at the expense of the owner and shall be made in accordance
with rules and regulations adopted by the city commission, which rules and regulations
shall provide for reasonable fees and charges for service. If a property owner fails to
connect to the sewer system within sixty (60) days after notification to do so, such owner
shall be required to pay charges for service the same as if the building were connected to
the system.
(c) Construction, repair and alteration of septic systems. It shall be unlawful for any
person to construct, repair, alter, do or have work done to any septic system within the
city's utility service area where connection to the city's sewer system is deemed to be
available. No person shall construct, repair, alter or enlarge any septic system where sewer
service is deemed to be unavailable unless such person receives approval by the director of
utilities and holds a valid permit for such work issued by the department of health and
rehabilitative services. The type, capacity, location, and layout of a septic system shall
comply with all regulations of the department of health and rehabilitative services.
(d) Purchase, installation and maintenance of pumping devices. Where estimated sewage
flow exceeds one thousand (1,000) gallons per day, elevation differences between the
building in question and the sewer system shall not be construed to mean that sewer service
is unavailable. In such instances where gravity flow cannot be maintained from the
building's drain to the sewer line, the owner of the building shall be required to purchase,
install and maintain, at the owner's expense, a device manufactured specifically for the
pumping of sewage into the sewer system. The operation and maintenance of the pumping
device shall be the sole responsibility of the owner or the owner's agent with a signed
waiver of the city's liability prior to connection to the system. If, as a result of geographical
location, it is deemed to be in the public interest to oversize the pumping device beyond
minimum requirements, the city may exercise the option to operate and maintain the
pumping device.
(e) Application for connection, inspection fee and notice for inspection. A connection
with the sewer system shall be made only after an application has been filed with the
building official. Such application shall state where the connection is to be made and such
other information and details as shall be prescribed by the building official. Such
inspection fee or other fees as may be required from time to time shall accompany the
application. No work shall be done until the application shall have been approved by the
building official and no connection with the sewer system shall be made without a permit
having been issued by the building official, and all such connections shall first be inspected
and approved before the same shall be covered by filling the excavation. Reasonable notice
shall be given to the building official of the time such connection is ready to be inspected.

owner at his expense.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96)
§ 21-52. Interceptors required.
Effective: Tuesday, December 19, 2017
Grease interceptors are not required for every residence. However, one (1) or more grease
interceptors are required where grease waste is produced in quantities that could otherwise
cause line stoppage or hinder sewage disposal.
(1) Fat, oil and grease (F.O.G.) interceptors required. Users who operate restaurants,
cafes, lunch counters, take-outs, cafeterias, bars, clubs, or hotel, hospital, factory or
school kitchens or other establishments that serve or prepare food where F.O.G. may be
introduced to the sewer system shall have a F.O.G. interceptor.
Take-out food establishments or other establishments that prepare food but do not
cook in oil or grease and who serve food only in disposable containers may utilize
alternative interceptors as approved by the public works director or his/her designee,
provided their discharges will not violate any discharge prohibitions of this section.
F.O.G. interceptors may also be required in non-cooking or cold dairy and frozen
foodstuff establishments when they are deemed necessary by the public works director
or his/her designee. Establishments that do not generate sufficient flow to warrant a
grease interceptor shall be authorized, at the discretion of the public works director or
his/her designee, to install an alternative grease prevention measure.
(2) Oil and sand interceptors required. Users who operate automatic and coin operated
laundries, car washes, filling stations, commercial garages or similar businesses having
any type of washing facilities or grease racks and any other users producing grit, sand,
oils or other materials in levels prohibited by 62-302 Florida Administrative Code Rule,
(grease and oils one hundred (100) mg/L) which may have the potential of causing
partial or complete obstruction of the building sewer or other areas in the sewer system
shall install interceptors approved by the public works director or his/her designee.
(3) Location of interceptors. Where a grease interceptor is required, kitchen wastewater
shall first pass through the interceptor and then be discharged into the sewer system. All
interceptors shall be located outside the building in such a manner that personnel from
city utilities division can inspect the interceptors at any time.
17/68
(4) Size of interceptors. All interceptors shall be sized to ensure that the city's sewer
system is protected from excessive F.O.G., sand and oil which may cause clogging or
damage and that the user is capable of meeting all discharge requirements. F.O.G.
interceptors shall be based on chapter 10 of the Florida Building Code, as amended.
Sizing of grease interceptors shall be based on the equations as set forth below. The
minimum volume of any grease interceptor shall be seven hundred and fifty (750)
gallons and the maximum volume of a single grease interceptor is greater than one
thousand two hundred and fifty (1,250) gallons, installation of grease receptors in series
is required.
Restaurants: (S) × (GS) × (HR/12) × (LP) = effective capacity of grease interceptor in
gallons, where:
S = number of seats in the dining area.
GS = gallons of wastewater per seat (use twenty-five (25) gallons for ordinary
restaurant, use ten (10) gallons for single service ordinance restaurants).
HR = number of hours' establishment is open.
LP = loading factor: use one and a quarter (1.25) for interstate highways, one (1.00)
for freeways, one (1.00) for recreational areas, 0.80 for main highways, and 0.50 for
other highways.
Other type establishments with commercial kitchens: (M) × (GM) × (LF) = effective
capacity of grease interceptor in gallons, where:
M = meals prepared per day.
GM = gallons of water used per meal (use five (5) gallons).
LF = loading factor (use 1.00 with dishwashing and 0.50 without dishwashing).
(5) Sampling port. A sampling port shall be installed in an approved location to allow
sampling by the utility and the user. The sample port shall be located between the
interceptor and the discharge point to the sewer system.
(6) Access manholes. An access manhole must have a minimum diameter of twenty-four
(24) inches and shall be provided over each chamber and sanitary tee. The access
manholes shall extend at least to the finished grade and be designed and maintained to
prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall have readily removable covers to
facilitate inspection and cleaning.
(7) Plans required. The following must be submitted to the city utilities division for
review and approval prior to installation of an interceptor:
a. Site plans showing the location of the interceptor, lines, clean out or manhole and
sample port;
b. Details of the interceptor, lines, clean out or manhole and sample port; and
c. Formula and calculation used to determine the interceptor capacity.
Note: No non-grease-laden sources are allowed to be connected to sewer lines intended
for grease, oil and sand separators.
18/68
(8) Existing interceptors. All interceptors currently in use or in existence at the time of
this division will be considered sized sufficiently provided they meet all discharge
requirements as stated in this division. All new interceptors or interceptors to replace or
upgrade existing interceptors will be required to meet all criteria stated in this division.
Existing interceptors that are currently undersized (less than seven hundred and fifty
(750) gallons) may be required to pump out more frequently than ninety (90) days. These
establishments will be required to comply within five (5) years of the effective date of
this division.
(9) Inspections. The director of the city utilities department or his or her designee shall
have the authority to inspect at a reasonable time (nominally within six (6) months unless
circumstances dictate more frequent inspections are required), those food service, food
processing, or other commercial establishments which may produce grease and which are
connected to a city sewer system to ensure that said establishments have installed and are
properly maintaining an adequate grease interceptor on all waste lines. When upon
inspection the interceptor,the total depth of the floating grease layer plus the settle-able
solids layer cannot exceed 25% of the total liquid depth of the interceptor or the
establishment exceeds discharge compliance levels, the utilities director or his/her
designee can require a grease pump out. Upon completion of an on-site inspection or
analytical results of sampling indicate a violation of this subsection, the public works
director or his/her designee may issue a "notice of violation" to the user or representative
to document any discrepancies, noncompliance, special instructions or other guidance
identified during the on-site inspection. Fines may be levied for failing to respond in a
timely manner to a notice of violation or order for corrective action. Fines may be issued
and not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00)/day/violation.
When upon inspection, the total depth of the floating grease layer plus the settle-able
solids layer cannot exceed 25% of the total liquid depth of the interceptor or the
establishment exceeds discharge compliance levels, the director can require a grease
pump out. Upon completion of an on-site inspection or analytical results of sampling
indicate a violation of this subsection, the director may issue a "notice of violation" to
the user or representative to document any discrepancies, noncompliance, special
instructions or other guidance identified during the on-site inspection.
(10) Maintenance.
a. All records pertaining to the maintenance of an interceptor shall be retained by the
user for a period of not less than three (3) years and available to city utilities
department upon request.
b. Every F.O.G. interceptor shall be cleaned every ninety (90) days or sooner, if needed.
An exemption may be granted to the ninety (90) day minimum requirement if the user
can establish that such maintenance schedule is not necessary.
Additional Maintenance Requirements
a. All users shall maintain any Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) recovery system so
that the discharges there from are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules,
and regulations.
b. All non-automobile services facility FOG traps, and all other nonautomobile
service facility FOG recovery systems, shall have all floating

with each submission.
(12) Repairs. Any repair that is required in regard to a FOG trap or FOG recovery
system shall be made by the user within thirty (30) days of the user receiving notice of
the need for a repair from either the hauler, the Director, or the Utilitys representative.
(13) Alternative treatments. The use of any free-enzyme, chemical, or other products
designed to emulsify, liquefy or further render grease soluble for the purpose of clearing
drains or circumventing the design of the interceptor is prohibited. All products
claiming biological activity must be approved by the public works director or his/her
designee. Approval for this or any other treatment does not relieve the user of properly
maintaining the interceptor as to prevent discharge violations to city sewer system.
Failure to comply with this section shall subject the user to appropriate enforcement,
fines, and procedures as set forth in this section. Additionally, if any person fails to
comply with this section and said failure results in damage to the city's system, the city
shall be entitled to recover the cost of repair of the system from said person and any
fines or penalties assessed against the city as a result of such failure.
(14) Sample collection.
a. Except as indicated in paragraph b., below, the user must collect wastewater
samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow
proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time
proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the user
demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous discharge limits.
21/68
b. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and
volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96; Ord. No. 2013-07, § 1, 5-7-13; Ord. No. 2017-22, § 1,
12-19-17;)
§ 21-53. Control facilities required.
When required to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes, the
owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall be
required by the director of utilities to install a suitable control manhole together with such
necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer. Such manhole, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with
plans approved by the director of utilities. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at
his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96)
§ 21-54. Requirements of testing parameters.
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which
reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater, published jointly by the
American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association and the
Water Environment Federation and shall be determined at the control manhole provided or
upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewer system and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb
and property. The director of utilities or his designee shall determine whether a twenty-four
(24) hour composite of all outfalls of the premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH's are
determined from periodic grab samples.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96)
§ 21-55. Special agreements or arrangements for treatment of unusual
wastes.
No statement contained in this division shall be construed as preventing any special
agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an
industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment,
subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96)
§ 21-56. Inspection and sampling.
22/68
The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its
representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for purposes
such as inspection, sampling, records examination or any other performance of duties. The
city and any approval authority shall have the right to set up on the user's property such
devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city and any approval authority will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
(Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, 5-21-96)
§ 21-57. Compliance with regulatory requirements.
( a ) General. The provisions of this division shall not be construed as alleviating
compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Specific user charge and
industrial cost recovery requirements, promulgated pursuant to Public Law 92-500, shall
be considered as a part of this division upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will
be required to comply with pretreatment standards as outlined in Title 40 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 403.
(b) Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the promulgation of the federal
categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal
standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The
appropriate approval authority shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12.
( c ) Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards. Where the city's
wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal
pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the appropriate approval authority for
modification of specific limits of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by
the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system for ninety-five (95) percent of the samples taken when measured
according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(C)(2) of (Title 40 of the Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 403) General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New
Sources of Pollution promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant
discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40
CFR Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the appropriate
authority is obtained.
(d) State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any
case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations of those in
this division.

Division 2. Cross Connection Control And Backflow Prevention Program
EDITOR'S NOTE
Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, adopted Sept. 7, 2011, repealed § 21-72 and renumbered § 21-73 as 21-
72 as set out herein. The former § 21-72 pertained to cross-connection/backflow prevention
and derived from Ord. No. 96-06, § 1, adopted May 21, 1996. The historical notation has been
retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes.
§ 21-76. Introduction.
A cross connection is defined by the American Water Works Association (AWWA) as "any
connection or structural arrangement between the public's or a consumer's potable water
system and any non-potable source or system through which backflow may occur."
Backflow, literally a reversal in the normal direction of flow within a water system, is what
turns a cross connection into a health hazard. Consequently, either cross connection or the
chance of backflow must be eliminated to prevent these "unseen hazards" from degrading
the high quality of water that the city utilities department strives to maintain.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-77. Purpose.
25/68
The purpose of this division is to protect the potable water supply of the city from the
possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within its customer's internal system
or systems those contaminants or pollutants which could backflow or back-siphon into the
public water supply system; to promote the elimination or control of existing cross
connections, actual or potential, between the customer's potable water system or systems
and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and industrial piping systems; and
provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control which
will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable
water systems.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-78. Utilities department to administer program; applicability of
provisions.
(a) The utilities department shall be responsible for administration of a cross-connection
control and backflow prevention program that complies with rules established by the state
department of environmental protection for protection of the public water supply system.
(b) The utilities department shall install and maintain a backflow preventer device in every
meter box where potable water is provided to an individually metered residential unit. Said
backflow preventer device shall be changed out periodically in accordance with rules of the
state department of environmental protection.
(c) The provisions of this division shall apply to all commercial meters and irrigation
meters connected to the City of Lake Wales water system.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-79. Definitions.
For the purpose of this division, the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:
Approved. Accepted by the city as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this
division, or as suited for the proposed use.
Auxiliary water supply. Any water supply on, or available to, the premises other than the
city's approved public potable water supply. These waters may be polluted or contaminated
or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the
city does not have sanitary control.
Backflow. The flow of water or other liquid, mixture, or substance under pressure into the
distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source or sources other than
its intended source.
Backflow preventer. A device or means designed to prevent backflow or back-siphonage.
Only the following are considered to be backflow prevention devices:
(1) Air gap separation. A physical separation between the free-flowing discharge end of
a potable water supply pipeline and an open or non-pressure receiving vessel. An
"approved air gap separation" shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe
measured vertically above the top of the rim of the vessel. In no case shall it be less than
one (1) inch.
26/68
(2) Reduced pressure backflow preventer. A device containing within its structure a
minimum of two (2) independently acting approved check valves, together with an
automatically operating pressure differential relief valve located between the two (2)
check valves. The first check valve reduces the supply pressure a predetermined amount
so that during normal flow and at cessation of normal flow the pressure between the
checks shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the
pressure between the checks less than the supply pressure. The unit shall include tightly
closing shutoff valves located at each end of the device, and each device shall be fitted
with properly located test cocks.
(3) Atmospheric vacuum breaker. A backflow prevention device which is operated by
atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity. The unit is designed to
work on a vertical plane only. The one (1) moving part consists of a poppet valve which
must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse
flow water when a negative pressure exists.
(4) Pressure vacuum breaker. A pressure vacuum breaker is similar to an atmospheric
vacuum breaker except that the checking unit "poppet valve" is activated by a spring. This
type of vacuum breaker does not require a negative pressure to react and can be used on a
pressure side of a valve.
( 5 ) Double check valve assembly. An assembly composed of two (2) single,
independently acting, check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at
each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the water tightness of each
check valve. A check valve is a valve that is drip-tight in the normal direction of flow
when the inlet pressure is one (1) psi and the outlet pressure is zero. The check valve
shall permit no leakage in a direction reverse to the normal flow. The closure element
(e.g. clapper) shall be internally weighted or otherwise internally loaded to promote rapid
and positive closure.
(6 ) Residential dual check. A compact unit manufactured with two (2) independent
spring actuated check valves. The residential dual check is acceptable only as added
backflow prevention in areas served by reuse systems defined in Chapter 62-610, Part III,
FAC, when the cross connection control program identifies activities specific to
subsections (5)(a) and (5)(b) of this section.
Back-siphonage. The flow of water or other liquid, mixture, or substance into the
distributing pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than its intended
source caused by the sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system.
Contamination. An impairment of the quality of potable water by sewage, industrial
fluids, waste liquids, compounds, or other materials to a degree which creates a potential
actual hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
27/68
Cross connection. Any physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between
two (2) otherwise separate piping systems, one (1) of which contains potable water and the
other non-potable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or
because of which, backflow or back-siphonage may occur into the potable water system. A
water service connection between a public potable water distribution system and a
customer's water distribution system which is cross-connected to a contaminated fixture,
industrial fluid system, or with a potentially contaminated supply or auxiliary water
system, constitutes one (1) type of cross connection. Other types of cross connection
include connectors such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves,
spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices, sliding multiport tube,
solid connections, and the like.
(1) Cross connection control by containment. The installation of an approved backflow
prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is
not physically and economically feasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all
actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system; or the
installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and
supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential
cross connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of
cross connection.
(2) Cross connectioncontrolled. A connection between a potable water system and a
non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention device properly
installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of
hazard.
Director. The director in charge of the city utilities department who is vested with the
authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross connection
control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.
Hazard, degree of. The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public
health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system, and shall
include:
(1) HazardHealth. Any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and
its operation that could create, or in the judgment of the director, may create a danger to
the health and well-being of the water consumer. An example of a "health hazard" is a
structural defect, including a cross connection, in the water supply system.
( 2 ) HazardPlumbing. A plumbing-type cross connection in a consumer's potable
water system that has not been properly protected by a vacuum breaker, air-gap
separation, or backflow prevention device. Unprotected plumbing-type cross connections
are considered to be a health hazard.
(3) HazardPollutional. An actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the
water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but
which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause
damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health.
(4 ) HazardSystem. An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical
properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or
of a pollutant or contaminant which would have a protracted effect on the quality of the
potable water in the system.
28/68
Industrial fluids system. Any system containing a fluid or solution which may be
chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration
such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional, or plumbing hazard if introduced
into an approved water supply. This may include, but shall not be limited to: polluted or
contaminated waters; all types of process waters and "used waters" originating from the
public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in
fluid form; plating acids and alkalis; circulated cooling waters connected to an open
cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or
stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from wells, springs,
streams, rivers, bays, harbors, irrigation canals or systems, and the like; and oils, gases,
glycerin, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in
industrial or other purposes or for firefighting purposes.
Pollution. The presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in
water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the
usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the
public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic
use.
Utilities department. The City of Lake Wales Utilities Department.
Water.
(1) WaterNon-potable. Water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of
questionable potability.
(2) WaterPotable. Any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for
human consumption.
(3 ) WaterService connections. The terminal end of a service connection from the
public potable water system; that is, where the city loses jurisdiction and sanitary control
over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is
installed at the end of the service connection, the service connection shall mean the
downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service
line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to
the customer's water system. "Service connection" shall also include water service
connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service
connections from the public potable water system.
( 4 ) WaterUsed. Any water supplied from the public potable water system to a
consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer
under the sanitary control of the city.
Water system. The water system shall be considered as made up of two (2) parts: the
customer system and the utility system.
( 1 ) The "customer system" shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the
termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in conveying utilitydelivered
domestic water to points of use.
29/68
(2) The "utility system" shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system;
and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the
utility, up to the point where the customer's system begins (meter). The source shall
include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage, and
delivery of water to the distribution system. The distribution system shall include the
network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's
system.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-80. Backflow prevention devices; when required; specifications.
(a) No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained unless the
water supply is protected as required by state law and regulation (Florida Administrative
Code Rule 17-555) and this division. Service of water to any premises shall be
discontinued if a backflow prevention device required by this division is not installed,
tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been
removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service
will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected.
( b) The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to
authorized representatives of the utilities department to determine whether cross
connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these
regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the city shall deny or
immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the
service line until the customer has corrected the condition in conformance with state and
city laws relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.
(c) An approved backflow prevention device shall be installed on each service line to a
customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building
being served and, in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line,
wherever the following conditions exist:
(1) In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of
safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional
source by the director. The public water system shall be protected against backflow from
the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to
the degree of hazard.
(2) In the case of premises upon which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable
substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the
public water system, the public system shall be protected against backflow from the
premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the
degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating
from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality.
(3) In the case of premises having internal cross connections that cannot be permanently
corrected and controlled, intricate plumbing and piping arrangements, or where entry to
all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes, making it
impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections
exist, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by
installing a backflow prevention device in the service line. The type of protective device
required shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists, as follows:
30/68
a. In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in this
section, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device.
b. In the case of any premises where there is water or some substance that would be
objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system,
the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly.
(4) In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is
handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water
system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap separation or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. Examples of
premises where these conditions may exist include wastewater treatment plants,
wastewater pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and
metal plating plants.
(5) In the case of any premises where there are "uncontrolled" cross connections, either
actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air-gap
separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device at the
service connection.
( 6 ) In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other
prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant
cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow or
back-siphonage from the premises by the installation of a backflow prevention device in
the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be required; that is, an approved
air-gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device
shall be installed in each service to the premises.
(d) Any backflow prevention device required herein shall be of a model and size approved
by the director or his/her designee. The term "approved backflow prevention device" shall
mean a device that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards
established by the American Water Works Association and entitled "AWWA C506-69
Standards for Reduced Pressure Principle and Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention
Devices" and which has met completely the laboratory and field performance specifications
of the Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University
of Southern California established by "Specifications of Backflow Prevention Devices
#69-2 dated March 1969" or the most current issue.
(1) Said AWWA and FCCC and HR standards and specifications are hereby adopted by
the City of Lake Wales. Final approval shall be evidenced by a certificate of approval
issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with said AWWA
standards and FCCC and HR specifications.
(2) It shall be the duty of the utilities department to perform certified inspections and
operational tests at least once per year where backflow prevention devices are installed
on commercial meters and irrigation meters. In those instances where the director deems
the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent
intervals. The cost of these inspections and tests shall be paid by the customer in
accordance with section 21-172; said inspections and tests shall be performed by
authorized utility personnel.
31/68
(3) All backflow prevention devices shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the
expense of the customer-user whenever said devices are found to be defective. The
customer-user shall engage a licensed plumber to perform the work. Records of such
repairs, overhauls, and replacements shall be kept and made available to the utilities
department.
( 4 ) All presently installed backflow prevention devices which do not meet the
requirements of this division but were approved devices for the purposes described
herein at the time of installation and which have been properly maintained shall, except
for the inspection and maintenance requirements, be excluded from the requirements of
these rules so long as the director is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the public
potable water supply system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present
location or requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the director finds that the
maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow
prevention device meeting the requirements of this division.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-81. Permit required for installation of backflow prevention devices.
Florida Administrative Code Rule 62-555.360(4) requires that backflow prevention
devices shall be installed in agreement with and under the supervision of the supplier of the
water or its designated representative. Accordingly, a permit issued by the city and
inspection by the city's building official or his/her designee following installation shall be
required for every backflow prevention device installed on any commercial or irrigation
connection to the city utility system.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)
§ 21-82. Notice of violation; failure to remedy.
If, in the judgment of the utilities department, an approved backflow prevention device is
required at the city's water service connection to any customer's premises for the safety of
the water system, the director or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to the
customer to install such an approved backflow prevention device at each service
connection to his premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved device
or devises at his own expense; the failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the customer
to install said device or devices immediately shall constitute a ground for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such device or devices have been properly installed.
(Ord. No. 2011-15, § 1, 9-7-11)

(c) Legislative Findings.
(1) Pursuant to Article VIII, section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and sections 166.021
and 166.041, Florida Statutes, the City has all powers of local self-government to perform
municipal functions and render municipal services except when prohibited by law, and
such power may be exercised by the enactment of legislation in the form of City
Ordinances.
(2) The City Commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary
power for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the City
Commission may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act,
except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida
Statutes. The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3),
Florida Statutes, are not relevant to the imposition of Stormwater Utility Fees by the City.
(3) The purpose of this Ordinance is to (1) provide procedures and standards for the
imposition of Stormwater Utility Fees under the constitutional and statutory power of the
City; (2) authorize a procedure for the funding of Stormwater Management Services,
facilities, or programs provided to properties within the Stormwater Service Area; and (3)
legislatively determine the benefit provided to all parcels of Developed Property from the
Stormwater Utility.
(4) Pursuant to the constitutional and statutory authority of the City and pursuant to
section 403.0893, Florida Statutes, the City has the authority to create a Stormwater
Utility and fund the construction, operation, maintenance, and administration of said utility
through the imposition of a Stormwater Utility Fee.
(5) The Florida Legislature has mandated that local governments in the State of
Florida, including the City, have the responsibility for developing mutually compatible
stormwater management programs consistent with the rules and regulations of the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection, the Federal Clean Water Act, and the water
management districts and the stormwater management programs established and
maintained by other local governments.
38/68
(6) The Stormwater Utility Fees imposed hereby are consistent with the authority
granted in section 403.0893, Florida Statutes. That statutory provision is additional and
supplemental authority to the constitutional and statutory power of self-government
granted to a municipality.
(7) The Stormwater Utility regulates the use and enjoyment of all Developed Property
within the City by treating and controlling contaminated Stormwater generated by
improvements constructed on the Developed Property resulting in the alteration of such
property from its natural state to accommodate such improvements.
(8) The special benefits provided by the Stormwater Management Services to all
Developed Property located within the Stormwater Service Area include, but are not
limited to: (1) the provision of Stormwater Management Services and the availability and
use of facilities and improvements by the owners and occupants of Developed Property to
properly and safely detain, retain, convey and treat Stormwater discharged from Developed
Property; (2) stabilization of or the increase of Developed Property values; (3) increased
safety and better access to Developed Property; (4) improved appearance; (5) rendering
Developed Property more adaptable to a current or reasonably foreseeable new and higher
use; (6) alleviation of the burdens caused by Stormwater runoff and accumulation
attendant with the use of Developed Property; and (7) fostering the enhancement of
environmentally responsible use and enjoyment of the natural resources within the
Stormwater Service Area.
(9) The City's Stormwater Management Services are necessitated by the existence of
Impervious Area. Accordingly, it is fair and reasonable to impose a Stormwater Utility Fee
only against Developed Property containing at least 100 square feet of Impervious Area.
(10) Substantially all of the Stormwater burden managed, controlled, and treated by the
Stormwater Utility is generated by Developed Property and the amount of Stormwater
generated by property in its natural state that is managed, controlled and treated by the
Stormwater Utility is inconsequential.
(11) The Stormwater Utility Fees imposed herein provide a reasonable method of
funding the City's cost of providing Stormwater Management Services because such costs
provide a reasonable estimation of the costs of providing Stormwater Management
Services to such property based upon the City's budget and resource allocations and
managing the Stormwater burden generated by the use of such property as individually
classified on the basis of the Stormwater burden expected to be generated by the physical
characteristics of such property.
(12) The Stormwater Utility Fee is reasonably related to the cost of providing
Stormwater Management Services, including the collection, storage, treatment, and
conveyance of Stormwater generated by Developed Property.
(13) The Stormwater Utility Fee is not a special assessment; it is a regulatory fee
imposed for the Stormwater Management Service provided to Developed Property by the
City's Stormwater Utility.
(d) Stormwater Utility and Utility Fund.
39/68
(1) There is hereby established a Stormwater Utility, which shall be the operational
means of implementing and otherwise carrying out the functional requirements of the
City's Stormwater management system to construct or acquire Stormwater improvements
and provide Stormwater Management Services. The Stormwater Utility shall provide
administration and management services in: the operation and maintenance of the City's
capital facilities for Stormwater management; the preparation of Stormwater studies and
the implementation of the Stormwater Utility; the regulation of Stormwater Basins; and the
repair, replacement, improvement and extension of the City's capital facilities for
Stormwater management. The Stormwater Utility shall place emphasis on the achievement
of maximum efficiency through identifying programs and funding sources which are
complementary to other regional, state and federal programs. The City Manager or his
designee shall be responsible for administration of the Stormwater Utility.
(2) The City Commission intends to fund all or part of the cost of providing services
and capital facilities for Stormwater management through Stormwater Utility Fees. The
City Commission has further concluded that periodic determination of revenues earned
and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of services and capital
facilities for Stormwater management will enhance accountability and management control
of the City's Stormwater Utility and will facilitate implementation of the City
Commission's funding policy for Stormwater management. Accordingly, there shall be
established a Stormwater utility fund. From an accounting perspective, the Stormwater
utility fund shall be established as an enterprise fund.
(e) Stormwater Service Area.
(1) The City Commission hereby establishes the entire incorporated area of the City as
the Stormwater Service Area.
(2) The Stormwater Utility shall provide Stormwater Management Services to all
Developed Property within the Stormwater Service Area. All or any portion of the
Stormwater Service Cost may be funded from the proceeds of the Stormwater Utility Fee.
(3) The Stormwater Utility may also acquire and construct capital facilities to assist
and facilitate the provision of Stormwater Management Services within the Stormwater
Service Area.
(f) Stormwater Utility Fees.
(1) The City Commission is hereby authorized to impose a Stormwater Utility Fee on
all Developed Property within the Stormwater Service Area to fund all or any portion of
the Stormwater Service Cost at a just, fair, reasonable, and equitable rate based upon such
property's Stormwater burden and the reasonable cost of providing Stormwater
Management Services to such property.
The rate of the Stormwater Utility Fee for each classification of property shall be
determined by each property's individual number of ERUs based upon that property's
amount of Impervious Area.
(2) The Stormwater Utility Fee will be computed for each parcel of Developed
Property located within the Stormwater Service Area by multiplying the number of Net
ERUs attributable thereto by the rate per ERU as established by separate Resolution. The
rate of the Stormwater Utility Fee shall be established and amended by separate Resolution
of the City Commission.
40/68
(3) The City Commission is also hereby authorized to impose Stormwater Utility Fees
to fund all or any portion of the cost necessary to fund a Stormwater Improvement
identified in any Stormwater Basin Plan or Stormwater Master Plan. The Stormwater
Utility Fees to fund the capital cost or the debt service and related cost of any obligations
issued to finance the cost of any Stormwater Improvements may be levied against all
parcels of Developed Property within the Stormwater Service Area at a rate based upon
the benefit accruing to such property from the Stormwater Improvement, measured by the
number of ERUs attributable to each parcel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the City Commission specifically determines that
any portion of the Stormwater Service Area receives a distinct special benefit from any
component of the Stormwater Management Service that is materially different in kind or
degree from the special benefit received by other portions of the Stormwater Service Area,
the Stormwater Service Cost related to such component shall be levied against the portion
of the Stormwater Service Area receiving the distinct special benefit.
(g) Assignment of ERUS.
(1) Each parcel of Developed Property located within the Stormwater Service Area
shall be assigned to one of the following classifications: Small Single Family Residential
Parcels, Medium Single Family Residential Parcels, Large Single Family Residential
Parcels, Very Large Single Family Residential Parcels, Condominium Residential Unit
Parcels, or General Parcels. ERUs shall be assigned to each parcel of Developed Property
within the Stormwater Service Area in accordance with the procedures provided in this
Section.
(2) Single Family Residential Parcels.
(i) The cost of measuring or verifying the Impervious Area for each individual
Single Family Residential Parcel greatly exceeds any benefit to be derived from individual
measurement and verification.
(ii) The City has computed an average Building Footprint of 1,073 square feet for a
typical Small Single Family Residential Parcel with a total impervious area of 2,100
square feet. The number of ERUs attributable to each Small Single Family Residential
Parcel shall be computed by dividing the total impervious area of the typical Small Single
Family Residential Parcel by the total impervious area of the typical Medium Single
Family Residential Parcel (3,652 square feet). Accordingly, the number of Net ERUs
attributable to each Small Single Family Residential Parcel shall be computed by
multiplying 0.58 ERUs by the appropriate Mitigation Credit Factor.
(iii) The City has computed an average Building Footprint of 2,073 square feet for a
typical Medium Single Family Residential Parcel with a total impervious area of 3,652
square feet. Accordingly, the number of Net ERUs attributable to each Medium Single
Family Residential Parcel shall be computed by multiplying one (1.0) ERU by the
appropriate Mitigation Credit Factor.
(iv) The City has computed an average Building Footprint of 3,390 square feet for a
typical Large Single Family Residential Parcel with a total impervious area of 5,546
square feet. The number of ERUs attributable to each Large Single Family Residential
Parcel shall be computed by dividing the total impervious area of the typical Large Single
Family Residential Parcel by the total impervious area of the typical Medium Single
Family Residential Parcel (3,652 square feet). Accordingly, the number of Net ERUs
attributable to each Large Single Family Parcel shall be computed by multiplying 1.52
ERUs by the appropriate Mitigation Credit Factor.
41/68
(v) The number of ERUs attributable to each Very Large Single Family Residential
Parcel (parcels with a Building footprint in excess of 5,100 square feet) shall be computed
in the manner provided herein for General Parcels.
(3) Residential Condominium Parcels.
(i) A residential Condominium constitutes a unique form of real property
ownership comprised of Condominium Residential Unit Parcels, to which there may be an
appurtenant undivided share in Condominium Common Area Parcels.
(ii) It is fair and reasonable to attribute the Impervious Area of Condominium
Common Area Parcels to the Condominium Residential Unit Parcels to which such
Condominium Common Area Parcels are appurtenant.
(iii) The number of Net ERUs attributable to each Condominium Residential Unit
Parcel in a residential Condominium shall be equal to the sum of the following: (a) the
amount computed by multiplying (1) the amount calculated by (i) dividing the Impervious
Area of the Condominium Complex on which the Condominium Residential Unit Parcel is
located by the ERU Value (3,652 square feet), and (ii) dividing the result by the total
number of Condominium Residential Unit Parcels located on such Condominium, and by
(2) the appropriate Mitigation Credit Factor.
(4) General Parcels. The number of Net ERUs attributable to each General Parcel
shall be determined by (1) dividing the Impervious Area of the General Parcel by the ERU
Value (3,652 square feet), and (2) multiplying the result by the appropriate Mitigation
Credit Factor.
(h) Private Mitigation Facilities.
(1) The City Commission recognizes the benefits provided by privately maintained
Mitigation Facilities. Properties supporting private Mitigation Facilities should be credited
for the public benefits they provide. Accordingly, the charges based on the number of
ERUs otherwise attributable to such property may be adjusted by a Mitigation Credit
determined in accordance with the City's Mitigation Credit Policy which may be adopted
by the City Commission by separate Resolution. No Mitigation Credit shall exceed the
amount of the Tax Parcel's Stormwater Utility Fee.
(2) In order to receive a new Mitigation Credit for which property is eligible, a
nonresidential property owner shall be required to provide the City Utilities Director with
"as built" drawings of the Mitigation Facilities sealed by a Florida registered professional
engineer, a certification from a Florida registered professional engineer as to the standards
of retention and detention achieved by the Mitigation Facilities, or such other reasonable
requirements as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section. Applicants for
residential mitigation credits may include property owners, homeowners' associations and
community development districts and shall provide sufficient information to adequately
evaluate the basis for said credit.
(3) No Mitigation Credit shall be applied for service provided to property by a
Mitigation Facility constructed or maintained with public funds. However, a Mitigation
Credit shall be applied for service provided to property by a regional Mitigation Facility if
the developer of the property provided a capital contribution to the regional facility in lieu
of constructing on-site facilities.
(i) Billing and Collection.
42/68
(1) The Stormwater Utility Fees authorized herein shall be billed and collected on a
monthly basis along with the City's other utility fees in the regular utility billing cycle,
appearing as a separate line item. Bills for the Stormwater Utility Fees shall be payable at
the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties as have been
heretofore established for the other utility fees charged and administered by the City.
(2) In the event a Developed Property does not have other City utility service, a new
account shall be developed and the property shall be billed by the City for the Stormwater
Utility Fees on an annual basis.
(3) A monthly billing charge shall also be assessed against each City utility account
provided however; only one billing charge shall be assessed, regardless of whether the
customer receives water service, wastewater service, stormwater service, reclaimed water
service or any combination thereof.
(j) Adjustments and Appeals.
(1) All requests for adjustment of the Stormwater Utility Fee shall be submitted to the
City Utilities Director. The City Utilities Director shall review each request as follows:
(i) All requests shall be in writing and set forth in detail the grounds upon which
relief is sought.
(ii) All adjustment requests shall be reviewed within four months from the date of
submission. Adjustments resulting from such requests shall be retroactive to the date of
submission.
(iii) The person requesting the adjustment may be required, at his or her own cost, to
provide supplemental information to the City Utilities Director, including but not limited
to survey data, traffic studies and other engineering reports prepared by a registered
professional land surveyor (R.P.L.S.) or professional engineer (P.E.), as required. Failure
to provide such information in a timely manner may result in denial of the adjustment
request.
(iv) The City Utilities Director shall provide the person requesting the adjustment
with a written determination of the request within the time provided herein.
(2) All determinations of the City Utilities Director pursuant to Section (j) may be
appealed to the City Manager. Appeals must be filed with the City Manager within 30 days
of issuance of the City Utilities Director's written determination. Appeals shall be
determined by the City Manager within 30 days of filing. In evaluating appeals, the City
Manager shall be bound by the method of setting rates as set forth in this Ordinance. The
decision of the City Manager shall be final.
(k) Revisions to Stormwater Utility Fees. If any Stormwater Utility Fee made under the
provisions of this Ordinance is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by
the judgment of any court, or if the City Commission is satisfied that any such Stormwater
Utility Fee is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if
the City Commission has failed to charge any property that should have been charged, the
City Commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new Stormwater Utility Fee
against any such property, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this
Ordinance and in case such second Stormwater Utility Fee is annulled, the City
Commission may obtain and impose other Stormwater Utility Fee until a valid Stormwater
Utility Fee is imposed.
43/68
(I) Procedural Irregularities. Any irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the
levy of any Stormwater Utility Fee under the provisions of this Ordinance shall not affect
the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any Stormwater Utility Fee as
finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such Stormwater Utility
Fee was duly levied, that the Stormwater Utility Fee was duly made and adopted, and that
all other proceedings adequate to such Stormwater Utility Fee were duly had, taken and
performed as required by this Ordinance; and no variance from the directions hereunder
shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially
injured thereby.
(m) Flooding; Liability. Floods from Stormwater runoff may occasionally occur which
exceed the capacity of Stormwater management facilities constructed, operated or
maintained by funds made available under this Ordinance. This Ordinance shall not be
construed or interpreted to mean that property subject to the fees and charges established
herein will always (or at any time) be free from Stormwater flooding or flood damage, or
that Stormwater systems capable of handling all storm events can be cost-effectively
constructed, operated or maintained. Nor shall this Ordinance operate to create any liability
on the part of, or cause of action against, the City, or any official or employee thereof, for
any flood damage that may result from such storms or the runoff thereof. Nor does this
Ordinance purport to reduce the need or the necessity for obtaining flood insurance by
individual property owners.

provided to property outside the Lake Wales Utility Service Area. Such service will be
extended on an actual cost basis and may include service to a governmental entity. All
applications for service outside the Lake Wales Utility Service Area shall be reviewed by
the city, and such service shall be approved only if an adequate supply of reclaimed water is
and will be available to meet all anticipated needs within the Lake Wales Utility Service
Area. The director shall review and approve all service line sizes and all other necessary
design components. Final approval of reclaimed water service outside the Lake Wales
Utility Service Area must be granted by the commission.
(c) Availability of service. The existence of a reclaimed water main adjacent to or near the
premises of an applicant for service does not necessarily mean that service is available to
that location. The director shall make a determination of reclaimed water availability based
on total system demand, specific transmission/distribution capabilities within the subject
project area, and the estimated cost of providing reclaimed water service to the subject
project area. No service taps will be made to reclaimed water transmission mains larger
than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter unless specifically approved by the director.
Service in areas where only transmission mains exist will require installation of a
distribution main, or approval on a case-by-case basis by the director for a service tap.
(d) Right to service. No payment of any costs, submittal of any application or petition, or
undertaking of any other act to receive reclaimed water service shall guarantee such
service. The city shall have the right, at all times, to refuse to extend service on the basis of
a use detrimental to the system, inadequate supply of reclaimed water, lack of payment of
required fees, or for any other reason which, in the judgement of the director, will cause
the extension not to be beneficial to the city.

§ 21-125. Extension of reclaimed water service within designated service
areas.
46/68
(a) Where service is available. Customers in designated reclaimed water service areas may
connect to the reclaimed water system when service is available and upon submission and
approval of an application for service and compliance with all other city requirements. A
reclaimed water customer with an average daily consumption that will exceed one hundred
thousand (100,000) gallons per day or a reclaimed water customer using a master meter to
irrigate a golf course, shopping center, subdivision, multi-family complex, or other
development area or a reclaimed water customer irrigating a property that exceeds five (5)
acres in size shall, in lieu of an application for service, execute a reclaimed water use
agreement with the city specifying terms and conditions of reclaimed water service.
(b) Where service is not available. Property owners in designated water service areas
where service is not yet available shall petition the city on an appropriate form obtained
from the department. This initial petition shall represent an expression of interest by the
property owners and shall not constitute a binding commitment.
(1) Upon receipt of a petition from property owners in seventy-five (75) percent of the
project area, the city shall prepare a preliminary estimate of the cost to extend a pipeline
to the area of the interested property owners and prepare a customer packet consisting of:
a. Formal petition cost estimate;
b. Voluntary lien agreement;
c. Application for reclaimed water service.
(2) If the estimated cost is agreeable to the property owner, the property owner shall
execute a voluntary lien agreement and return it to the department. Upon the receipt of a
valid voluntary lien agreement and application for service from seventy-five (75) percent
of the property owners in the project area, a resolution prepared in accordance with the
requirements of F.S. ch. 170, declaring a special assessment of all property owners in the
property area shall be presented to the commission for action.
(3) Upon passage of the special assessment resolution, the department will design or
cause to be designed a reclaimed water system for the approved project area and obtain
bids to construct the project in accordance with the city's purchasing procedures.
(4) After bids are received, the director shall advise the petitioning property owners of
any anticipated increase in the cost of extending the pipeline. Should the cost to extend
the reclaimed water line exceed ten (10) percent of the initially estimated cost, each
petitioning property owner shall have the right to withdraw the voluntary lien agreement
before final approval of the project.
47/68
(5) If the best responsive bid to construct the reclaimed water system does not exceed ten
(10) percent of the previously estimated cost or if the revised costs are acceptable to
seventy-five (75) percent of the property owners and the voluntary lien agreements of
seventy-five (75) percent of the property owners remain on record with the city, the
commission may publish a preliminary assessment role that includes all property owners
in the project area and hold a public hearing in accordance with F.S. ch. 170, for the
purpose of giving final consideration to funding the project with special assessments.
Following the public hearing, the commission may cancel the project or proceed to levy
the special assessments. Thereafter, the commission shall meet as an equalizing board to
hear and consider any and all complaints as to the special assessments and shall adjust
and equalize the assessments in accordance with F.S. ch. 170. When so equalized and
approved by resolution of the commission, a final assessment role shall be filed with the
city clerk and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid, and binding
first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid.
Following approval of the equalizing resolution, the commission may award the bid and
authorize commencement of the project.
(6) After the project is completed, the city shall credit to each of the assessments the
difference in the assessment as originally approved and the proportionate part of the
actual cost of the project as finally determined. Said final assessment shall be calculated
on the basis of capital cost to construct, less any state or federal aid received. In no event
shall the final assessments exceed the amount of benefits originally assessed.
(7) The special assessment shall be payable at the time and in the manner stipulated in the
resolution providing for the project. In accordance with F.S. § 170.09, the assessment
shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed eight (8) percent per year, or, if improvement
bonds are issued, at a rate not to exceed one (1) percent above the rate of interest at
which the improvement bonds are issued. Assessments may be payable in equal
installments over a period not to exceed thirty (30) years, and, if not paid when due, there
shall be added a penalty at the rate of one (1) percent per month until paid. Assessments
may be paid without interest at any time within thirty (30) days after connecting to the
reclaimed water system.
(8) A claim of lien on behalf of the city will be filed by the city clerk for all assessments
remaining unpaid at the end of thirty (30) days after connecting to the reclaimed water
system.
(9) All actions taken in the process of funding an extension of reclaimed water service
through special assessments shall comply with the requirements of F.S. ch. 170.
(c) Requirements for new development in designated service areas. All developers of new
residential and commercial projects in a reclaimed water service area as designated in
section 21-124 shall be required to construct in accordance with section 21-128 such
lines, appurtenances, or facilities as will be necessary to utilize reclaimed water for
irrigation purposes. All requirements provided in section 21-4 for construction of utility
lines and other additions to the system shall pertain to the reclaimed water system. The city
shall retain the right, at all times, to refuse or delay extension of service on the basis of
inadequate supply of reclaimed water or for any other reason which, in the judgement of
the director, will cause the extension not to be beneficial to the city.
48/68
(d) Liability for permits. The city shall obtain and fulfill, at its expense, all necessary
permits and approvals for the construction and operation of the reclaimed water
distribution mains constituting the city's reclaimed water system. Once service is available,
any additional permits or approvals required for service to any particular customer, for the
customer's benefit, shall be obtained at the sole expense of said customer.

§ 21-127. Discontinuation and interruption of service.
50/68
(a) Discontinuation of service by city. The city may discontinue reclaimed water service to
any customer due to a violation of the terms of this chapter or any other city regulation,
nonpayment of bills, tampering with any service, plumbing of cross-connections with
another water source, or the undertaking of any other activity that may be detrimental to
the system. The city has the right to cease service until the condition is corrected and all
costs due to the city are paid. These costs may include delinquent billings, connection

CHAPTER 23. ZONING, LAND USE AND
DEVELOPMENT REGULATION
Article I. General Provisions
§ 23-101. Title.
This ordinance is a compilation of the zoning, land use and development regulations for
the city and shall be entitled "The City of Lake Wales Zoning, Land Use and Development
Regulations" and is referred to herein as the "land development regulations."
§ 23-102. Authority.
This ordinance enacting the City of Lake Wales Land Development Regulations is adopted
pursuant to the authority of Article VII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, the "Municipal
Home Rule Powers Act," F.S. § 166.021, et al and the "Local Government Comprehensive
Planning and Land Development Regulation Act," F.S. § 163.3202.
§ 23-103. Purpose and intent.
The city has adopted these land development regulations to implement the city's
comprehensive plan through the establishment of certain regulations, procedures and
standards for reviewing and approving all development orders, permits and all development
and use of land within the incorporated area of the City of Lake Wales. This ordinance is
enacted in order to protect and preserve the public health, safety, and general welfare and to
assist in the orderly and controlled growth and development of the city. It is the further
intent of this ordinance that the city's land development regulations offer and establish an
efficient, effective and equitable regulatory and procedural code relating to the
development of the city while adequately respecting and protecting the rights and interests
of the citizens of the City of Lake Wales.
§ 23-104. Findings of fact.
a. The Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act
of 1985, F.S. ch. 163, requires the City of Lake Wales to enact land development
regulations which are consistent with the city's comprehensive plan to implement that plan
and control and provide for development within the City of Lake Wales. The land
development regulations contain specific and detailed provisions that are necessary and
desirable to implement the adopted comprehensive plan and are consistent with that plan.
b. The control of the location, design and construction of development within the City of
Lake Wales is necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to
maintain and continue the existing quality of life within the City of Lake Wales. The land
development regulations accomplish that mandate.
c . This ordinance establishing and adopting the City of Lake Wales Land Development
Regulations was enacted pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 166.041(1)(c), and F.S. ch.
163, as applicable.

the time limits, conditions or terms set forth in the regulations under which that
development was originally approved. Such excepted development must meet only the

if the development plan, permit or order expires or is otherwise invalidated, any further
development on the site involved shall occur only in conformance with the requirements
of these land development regulations.
b. The provisions of the land development regulations shall not affect development for
which a building permit has been issued on or before the effective date of this ordinance,
provided that such building permit was lawfully issued and remains in full force and
effect and provided that such development activity as authorized has been commenced or
will commence within six (6) months of the effective date of the land development
regulations. This exception shall apply to development activity so long as such activity
continues without interruption until the development is completed. However, if the
building permit expires, any further development on that site shall occur only in
conformance with the requirements of these land development regulations.
c . The provisions of these land development regulations relating to concurrency
management shall not be applicable to a development order or permit for any singlefamily
residential unit if such single-family residential unit is the only development to be
undertaken or constructed by the owner of and upon a legal lot of record.
d . Utility installations, development by a government entity or public utility,
development of railroad facilities and development of public schools shall be governed
or regulated by these land development regulations except where specifically exempt as
provided by general law or these land use regulations.
Sec. 23-105.3 Development review. Development review which is not subject to these
land development regulations pursuant to the provisions of subsections 23-105.2a. and b.
shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with the land development regulations that
were applicable and in effect immediately prior to the adoption of these land development
regulations.
Sec. 23-105.4 Abrogation. These land development regulations are not intended to
abrogate, repeal or interfere with any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions
duly recorded in the public records of Polk County applying to, or lying within, the City of

any lawful approval given prior to the effective date of these land development regulations

b. Each and every person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains any such
violation may individually be found guilty of a separate offense and for each day after the

undertaking any other enforcement mechanism or procedure that may be available to
municipalities for the enforcement of ordinances as provided for by law, including the
filing of civil litigation and the obtaining of injunctive relief.

regulations is for any reason held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be

relocation of any tree meeting the definition of a tree unless specifically exempted.
17/285
A tree is defined for the purposes of this section as a woody, self-supporting plant, having
a mainstem or cluster of mainstems and having a diameter at four and one-half (4½) feet
above the ground of four (4) inches; a tree is further defined as a plant which at maturity
grows to at least fifteen (15) feet high in the Polk County area. Also specifically included
are significant stands of oak trees defined as a group of four (4) or more oak trees which
may have trunk diameters of less than four inches but which constitute a compact unit or
grove covering 50 square feet or more in area.
b . Exclusions and exemptions. Specifically excluded and exempted from permit
requirements are removal of individual citrus trees; however, this exemption is not
applicable to massive clearing of trees which will require a land alteration permit. Trees
exempt from the tree removal permit requirement include, but are not limited to, the
following:
Broussonetia-papyrifera (Paper mulberry)
Castor Bean
Catlainmonosa
Chinese Tallow

Serrenoa repens (Scrub palmetto)
Also exempted are trees destroyed or harmed by storm, provided the administrative
official is notified at least two (2) days in advance of the removal so that an inspection
can be made. If the administrative official or designee determines that the tree is not
severely harmed, the tree shall not be removed except through the approval of a tree
removal permit application. If the administrative official or designee does not respond
within two (2) working days of the request, the request shall be considered approved. The
two-day notification period is waived in instances where a damaged tree must be
removed in order to make emergency repairs authorized by the building official.
c . Dead trees. Dead trees are exempt from the permit requirements of this section,
provided the administrative official is notified at least two (2) days prior to its removal.
The administrative official may require removal of a dead tree.
d . Tree trimming. Tree trimming for normal maintenance purposes does not require a
permit; however, tree trimming which threatens the life of the tree or deforms the natural
canopy is prohibited. Each occurrence will be deemed a tree removal and will require tree
replacement in accordance with section 23-302.2.
18/285
e . Information required for application. The application shall indicate the type and
circumference of the tree or trees proposed for removal, if known, and the reason for a
requested removal. Trees to be removed for land development shall be shown on the site

removal application shall be part of the certificate of zoning compliance application. A tree
survey showing the location, type and size of all trees as defined in paragraph (a) above
may be required by the administrative official.
f. Issuance of permit. A tree removal permit application shall be approved or denied in
accordance with the provisions of section 23-302.2.
§ 23-215. Land alteration permit.
Sec. 215.1 Applicability. A land alteration permit is required prior to undertaking
activities listed below unless the activity is specifically authorized under a site
development permit pursuant to section 23-217 or the site is a single-family lot. A land
alteration permit is intended for authorizing site work not related to imminent
development of the land. It may be used to prepare land for agricultural use, improve the
appearance or conditions of a property or to prepare land for sale or for future
development. For site work in preparation for development, a site development permit is
required, pursuant to section 23-217, following the approval of a preliminary site plan,
subdivision, or planned development project plan. The removal of trees requiring a tree
removal permit pursuant to section 23-214 may be authorized under a land alteration
permit if warranted under the provisions of that section; however, it is the intent of this
chapter that the removal of trees from a site, other than a single-family lot, to be developed
in future be undertaken consistent with an approved preliminary plan (site plan,
subdivision, or planned development project) and site development permit pursuant to
section 23-217.
a . Massive clearing of vegetation, including clearing or grubbing of more than five
thousand (5,000) square feet of land, but not including mowing and cutting of brush for
maintenance.

(100) cubic yards of earth or the alteration of the elevation of more than one thousand
two hundred fifty (1,250) square feet of land area more than two (2) feet. The
application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the location and
area to be affected and by drawings showing cross-section of areas proposed for filling
or excavation. Additional information such as elevation and drainage data and tree survey
may be required by the administrative official if necessary to adequately predict the
consequences of the proposal. (See section 23-302).
Sec. 23-215.2 Application. Application shall be made on forms supplied by the
administrative official and shall be accompanied by the fee as set forth in section 23-242.
Sec. 23-215.3 Permit. The administrative official and the director of public works, as
applicable, shall review and act upon land alteration permit applications in accordance with
section 23-215 and article III, division 1, as applicable.

requirements of section 23-222 concurrently with the special exception use permit.
c. The number of site plans and other information required will be set forth in the
procedures manual maintained by the administrative official. Any application for
construction, certificate of zoning compliance, or certificate of use shall be pending until
action of the special exception permit application is complete.
Sec. 23-216.3 Public notice. Public notice shall be given by the administrative official as
per section 23-241.
Sec. 23-216.4 Approval/denial. Following a public hearing, the planning board shall
approve, approve with stipulations, or deny the application with specific reference to
criteria in section 23-433. Appeal of the decision of the planning board may be made by the
applicant pursuant to section 23-244.
Sec. 23-216.5 Compliance. The application and accompanying material, as well as any
stipulations made as conditions of approval shall be enforced by the administrative official
and shall be conditions of issuing the certificate of zoning compliance and certificate of
use.
Sec. 23-216.6 Expiration regulations

§ 23-222. Site plans.
29/285
Effective: Tuesday, December 06, 2016
Sec. 23-222.1 Purpose and intent.
a. The public health, safety, comfort, and welfare require the harmonious, orderly, and
progressive development of the land within the corporate limits of the City of Lake
Wales. Once land has been developed, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.
Substantial public responsibility is created by each new development, involving the
maintenance of streets and drainage facilities, and the provision of additional public
services. As the general welfare, health, safety, and convenience of the community are
thereby directly affected by the use of land, it is in the direct interest of the public that
developments be conceived, designed, and developed in accordance with sound rules and
proper minimum standards.
b. Consideration shall be given in the review of site plan applications to the character of
an area and the availability of public facilities to ensure the compatibility and
coordination of land uses and facilities within a given geographic unit and to ensure the
following:
1. The establishment of standards for site design which will encourage the development
of sound and stable areas within the corporate limits of the City of Lake Wales.
2. The adequate and efficient supply of utilities, streets, and services to new land
developments.
3. The prevention of haphazard, premature, or scattered land development.
4. The prevention of traffic hazards and congestion from excessive ingress and egress
points along major traffic arteries, and the provision of safe and convenient traffic
circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in new land development.
5. Safety from fire and other dangers to promote health and the general welfare.
6. Protection from flooding hazards and to ensure proper water management.
7. The provision of public open spaces in new land developments through the
dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational, and other public
purposes.
8. The maintenance of minimum standards for visual, design and aesthetic development
of properties in the city.
9. Protection of the natural and scenic resources of the city, including surface waters
and groundwater recharge areas.
Sec. 23-222.2 Applicability.
a. The procedures contained in this section are applicable to all projects which involve:
1. the construction of any facility other than a single-family dwelling on an individual
lot or major appurtenances thereto (e.g. private swimming pool, yard, fence, newsrack,
etc.) or one (1) duplex (two (2) dwelling units) on an individual lot. (See section 23-
212 for requirements for single-family and duplex structures);
2. substantial improvements to a site or building and the expansion or conversion of
existing structures, including expansions or changes in parking area layouts;
30/285
3. the change of use of a site or structure if for establishment of the new use, changes
in the site (such as the addition of parking spaces) are necessary to achieve compliance
with this chapter;
4. a special exception use permit.
No building permit shall be issued by the city and no site work shall be commenced
by the developer until a preliminary site plan has been approved by the administrative
official or the planning board, as applicable.
Upon preliminary site plan approval and issuance of a building permit, the
development shall be built in strict accordance with the approved preliminary site
plan and these regulations.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to public construction projects
undertaken by the City of Lake Wales except to the extent that the city manager
determines that a particular project will benefit from review by the development
review committee.
(Ord. No. 2007-02, § 2, 3-6-07)
Sec. 23-222.3 Application requirements for submittal of site plans.
a. Preapplication conference. It is required that the applicant schedule a pre-application
conference with the administrative official to discuss the proposed development no less
than two (2) weeks prior to submitting formal application for the preliminary site plan.
The purpose of this conference is to review the feasibility of the proposed development
and any potential waivers or variances.
The applicant must submit a boundary survey or conceptual plan illustrating lot
dimensions to scale, existing site conditions including stands of trees, the locations of
water bodies and wetlands, existing structures and other site improvements, and a
written description of the proposal. Information sufficient to identify natural features
of the property shall be provided by the applicant, such as aerial photographs,
topographic maps, flood maps, vegetation surveys, and wetlands maps.
The administrative official shall advise the applicant regarding the proposed
development in relation to the provisions of this chapter, particularly the land
development requirements of article III, div. 1, the district regulations of article IV,
div. 1 and the concurrency requirements of article VII, div. 1.
b . Determination of major and minor projects. Following the pre-application
conference, a preliminary determination shall be made by the administrative official as to
whether the proposal is a major or minor project, based upon the criteria below. A major
project requires review by the development review committee and review and decision by
the planning board. A minor project requires review by the development review
committee and a decision by the administrative official.
1. Major project. An application meeting any of the criteria below shall be classified as
a major project:
A. The project will have more than one (1) principal building on the site or meets the
definition of a "shopping center" or "business center";

2 . Minor project. All projects not meeting the criteria for a major project shall be
considered minor projects unless determined by the administrative official to warrant
review as a major project. Construction or alteration of a single-family residence or
duplex on a single lot requires review under section 23-212, verification of zoning
compliance.
c. Preliminary site plan application.
1. The application for preliminary site plan approval shall include a completed
application form, a site plan meeting the requirements of section 23-222.8, and the
application fee pursuant to section 23-242. The application form, number of copies of
plans, and deadlines for submission shall be set forth in the procedures manual

without review.
Sec. 23-222.4 Preliminary site plan review and approval.
a. Development review committee. Upon acceptance of the application as complete, the
administrative official shall schedule the application for review by the development
review committee at its next regular meeting. All preliminary site plans shall be reviewed
by the development review committee to determine that the plan meets the requirements
of this chapter.
1 . Minor projects. For a minor project, the administrative official shall determine,
after consultation with the development review committee, if the project complies with
the requirements of this chapter. The administrative official shall approve the
preliminary plan if the project is found to be in compliance or may approve the plan
with conditions if adjustments are necessary for compliance. If the proposed project is
found not to be in compliance with this chapter, the administrative official may, after
consultation with the applicant, request a revised plan, deny the plan with specific
reference to the deficiencies, or submit the plan to the planning board as a major
project requesting waivers. The site plan shall also be reviewed under the concurrency
provisions of Article VII, Div. 1. The site plan shall not be approved if the concurrency
provisions of Article VII, Div. 1 are not met.
32/285
The administrative official shall have the authority to direct any site plan to planning
board review and approval, regardless of the criteria for major and minor projects.
The administrative official's decision shall be based upon an assessment of the
project's potential for negative impacts upon nearby properties or public facilities,
the need for protection of the public interest by formal planning board review of the
project, and/or the existence of unusual conditions associated with a site, project or
an application.
2. For major projects, after completion of review by the development review
committee in accordance with paragraph A., B. or C. below and based upon the
findings of the development review committee, the administrative official shall make a
written recommendation to the planning board for approval, approval with conditions,
or denial of the preliminary site plan.
A. The development review committee shall review the application in relation to the
purpose and requirements of the land development regulations and may forward the
application for review to the planning board or administrative official, as applicable,
with recommendations or may continue their review with a request for further
information or revisions. Within three (3) days of the meeting, the administrative
official shall inform the applicant in writing of the decision of the development
review committee with specific reference to their findings.
B. If the application review is continued by the development review committee, the
applicant shall provide the administration official with the requested information or
revised plans at least two (2) weeks prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of
the development review committee in order to be placed upon the development
review committee's agenda.
C. In the case of applications which are continued by the development review
committee, the applicant shall be granted, upon his request, a one-month extension of
time for review by the development committee. Further requests for extensions may
be granted at the discretion of the development review committee. Upon expiration
of any extension granted by the development review committee, the application may
expire and the fee shall be forfeited.
D. At the request of the applicant prior to the expiration of any extensions granted by
the development review committee, the application shall be forwarded to the
planning board for review and decision without a recommendation from the
development review committee. In making its decision, the planning board shall
consider the reasons stated by the development review committee for continuing the
review.
b . Planning board review. The planning board shall review the application with
reference to the requirements of this chapter, particularly the land development
requirements of Article III, Div. 1, the district regulations of Article IV, and the
concurrency requirements of Article VII, Div. 1. Based upon their review of the
information presented by the application, the recommendations of the administrative
official, and in consideration of the express purpose and intent and requirements of this
chapter, the planning board shall either approve, approve subject to stated conditions,
or deny the preliminary site plan. Where the planning board either denies or approves
with conditions, they shall enter specific findings of fact delineating their reasons.
(Ord. No. 2007-14, § 1, 6-5-07)
33/285
Sec. 23-222.5 Waiver of strict compliance. Upon a finding that there is reasonable cause
for granting a request for a waiver, the planning board may waive strict requirements of
this chapter in regard to the number and paving of off-street parking spaces, landscaping
requirements, and dimensional requirements for site circulation and access.
In deciding upon requests for waivers, the planning board shall endeavor to adhere to the
requirements of this chapter to the extent possible and to minimize deviations from its
requirements. The granting of waivers may be subject to conditions. Waivers may not be
granted for required building setbacks. (See appeals procedures in section 23-244.)
Waivers shall be granted only if safety is not compromised.
Reasons for granting such waivers may include:
a. The waiver is requested because existing legal non-conformities on the site present
difficulties in meeting the provisions of this chapter. Redevelopment of sites shall be
facilitated through the granting of waivers, provided such waivers do not result in overdevelopment
or use of a property.
b. The planning board finds that off-street parking requirements are excessive based on
the particular circumstances of the application or proposed characteristics of use such as
shared parking arrangements, hours of operation or scheduling, or proximity of public
parking.
c. Granting of the waiver allows for a superior site layout or buffering in terms of safety
or compatibility with the neighborhood.
(Ord. No. 2007-02, § 3, 3-6-07)
Sec. 23-222.6 Appeal of administrative determination. The planning board shall hear and
decide appeals of administrative determinations regarding a preliminary site plan. Such

expire two years from the date of approval unless an application for a site development
permit has been received or a building permit for a principal building has been issued. An
extension of time may be applied for (and granted in one-year increments) by the developer
by submitting a letter of request to the administrative official and the required fee. (See
Table 23-242.) The request for time extension may be approved by the administrative
official or the planning board in accordance with the manner in which the original approval
was granted.

§ 23-223. Land subdivision.
Effective: Tuesday, December 06, 2016
Sec. 23-223.1 Applicability.
a. The recording of a final subdivision plat approved as set forth in these land
development regulations is required prior to the subdivision of property. For the
purposes of these regulations, "subdivision" is defined as:
1. The division of a parcel of land (which in this context is defined to mean the totality
of contiguous land holdings by a single owner regardless of how described, recorded or
zoned) into three (3) or more lots or parcels of land less than five (5) acres each, for
the purpose, whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership or building
development;
2. Any division of land, regardless of the size of the parcels where the applicant
proposes to create a street, right-of-way, or easement that joins or connects to an
existing public street.
3 . Exception for minor subdivisions. Where property abuts an existing street and no
new improvements for water, sewer or drainage are required and where the proposed
subdivision contains four (4) or fewer commercial lots having common access to
existing public roads or seven (7) or fewer residential lots, the administrative official
with the concurrence of the development review committee, may waive preliminary
subdivision review and permit a final plat to be presented to the city commission for
approval in accordance with this section.
37/285
b. In accordance with authority granted by F.S. § 498.025, it shall be unlawful for any
owner of land, or agent of any owner, to transfer, sell or negotiate to sell such land by
reference to or exhibition of a plat, or by other use of said plat without having first
submitted such plat to the city for approval. If unlawful use is made of a plat before it is
properly approved and recorded, the owner or agent of the owner shall be subject to the
penalties provided in section 23-109. The governing body, or any appropriate official of
the governing body, shall also enjoin such transfer, sale or agreement. Failure to comply
with the provisions of this section shall not impair the title of land so transferred or
affect the validity of the title conveyed. However, a purchaser of land sold in violation of
this section shall, within two (2) years from the date of purchase thereof, be entitled to
bring appropriate action to avoid such sale or to bring action against the seller for any
damages which he suffers as a result of the seller's unlawful act or both.
c. The provisions of the subdivision plan requirements found in this section are
applicable to all single-family residential development projects and multi-family
residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, or any other non-residential
development project where the subdivision of land, subdivision infrastructure
improvements, and plat recording will precede individual site development. Where
multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, or any other non singlefamily
residential site development will occur within the subdivision concurrent with or
after plat recording, the developer of said site must also adhere to the requirements
provided in section 23-222 for site plans.
d. A resubdivision will be required if a proposed change to an approved or recorded
subdivision plat affects any street layout or any lot line so as to increase residential
density or involves the establishment of a new street or a change in any street line or
easement.
e. Property subdivided prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall comply with all
requirements of this ordinance unless such property fully complied with the terms of all
requirements in effect at the time such property was subdivided. Where a final plat has
not been recorded, owner(s) of all or part of undeveloped or partially developed plats
shall have one (1) year from the effective date of this ordinance to apply to the city for a
determination of vested rights. Failure to so apply shall result in all such plats being
vacated for purposes of this section.
f. Plats may also be filed for streets, rights-of-way, or easements. All plats filed shall
meet all requirements and follow all procedures as herein set forth.
Sec. 23-223.2 Preliminary subdivision plat application. The purpose of the preliminary

§ 23-227. Certificate of appropriateness.
Effective: Tuesday, January 19, 2016
A certificate of appropriateness is a written approval issued by the historic preservation
regulatory board for work proposed on buildings or sites within an historic district
designated under this chapter. See section 23-802 for definitions of terms used in this
section.
Sec. 227.[1]. Applicability.
a. Certificate of appropriateness. Unless otherwise provided herein, no person may undertake
the following actions affecting any property in an historic district designated under this chapter
without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the historic regulatory board.
1. Alteration of the exterior part of any building or structure, regardless of whether a building
permit is required for the work.
2. Demolition of a building, structure or object or removal of a significant exterior feature of a
building or structure. (Demolition delay only. See section 23-227.3.b.)
3. Installation of a new sign or alteration of an existing sign; removal of existing signs integral
to the architecture of any building. (See exemption for incidental signs.)
4. Construction of a new building or an addition to an existing building.
5. Construction of fences, not including hedges.
b. Exemptions. The following actions are exempt from the requirement of a certificate of
appropriateness:
1. Ordinary maintenance and repairs, provided the work involves repairs to existing features
of a structure or site or the replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in
appearance and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the
structure or site
2. Landscaping, not including non-vegetative features such as walls, fences, and paving.
52/285
3. The administrative official may determine that work is exempt from the requirement for a
certificate of appropriateness if the alteration will not be visible from a public street or
pedestrian way. The administrative official may impose reasonable conditions on the approval
in keeping with the guidelines of the historic board.
4. Murals, provided they do not meet the definition of a sign under this chapter.
5. Alterations meeting guidelines adopted by the historic board for paint color or other
materials.
6. Directional and other incidental signs exempt from permitting requirements under this
chapter.
c. Other permits. No building permit, demolition permit, land alteration permit, or site
development permit shall be issued for work on a building or site in an historic district
designated under this chapter unless a certificate of appropriateness has been issued for the
work or the work has been verified as exempt by the administrative official. The issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness shall not relieve the applicant from obtaining other required
permits and approvals. A building permit or other permit issued by the city shall be invalid if it
is obtained without the presentation of the certificate of appropriateness required for the
proposed work.
d. Violations; stop work. A stop work order shall be issued for any work undertaken in
violation of the requirement for a certificate of appropriateness or the conditions of a
certificate of appropriateness.
Sec. 23-227.2. Application.
a. Pre-application conference. A pre-application conference with the administrative official
is required prior to submission of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for
construction of a new building or an addition or for any alteration of the exterior of a
building within an historic district designated under this chapter. An applicant for any work
within an historic district may request a pre-application conference with the administrative
official or with the historic board to obtain information or guidance regarding a proposed
project. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to discuss and clarify
preservation objectives and guidelines of the historic board in relation to a proposed
project.
b. Application for certificate of appropriateness. Application shall be made on forms
supplied by the administrative official and shall be accompanied by the fee as set forth in
section 23-242. The number of copies of required support documents, application
deadlines, and review guidelines shall be set forth in the procedures manual maintained by
the administrative official.
The following support documents are required as applicable:
1. A site plan, rendering, sketch or drawing of the proposed work, specifically indicating the
proposed changes in appearance, color, texture of materials, dimensions, architectural
design of the exterior of the structure, including the front, sides, rear (if visible from a
public right-of-way), roof, and any alterations to or additions of any outbuilding, courtyard,
fence, or other accessory structure or improvement.
2. Photographs of the existing building, structure, or sign as applicable.
3. Photographs of adjacent buildings.
4. Any other information which may be reasonably required by the administrative official in
order to convey a clear understanding of the applicant's proposal.
Sec. 23-227.3. Review of application for certificate of appropriateness.
a. Administrative review.
1. All applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed by the administrative
official within ten (10) working days of receipt to determine that the application is complete
in accordance with the requirements of this section. Incomplete applications will be
returned to the applicant with reference to deficiencies.
53/285
2. Upon a finding that an application is complete, the administrative official, in consultation
with other department as necessary, shall review the application for compliance with the
purpose and intent of these regulations including the provisions of article IV, Resource
Protection Standards, division 5, Historic Preservation (section 23-651 et seq.). The
administrative official may request modifications or additional information if necessary.
3. After completion of review the administrative official may approve transmittal of the
application to the historic board or require re-submittal with modifications or corrections.
4. If the administrative official approves transmittal of the application to the historic board,
the applicant will submit additional copies or information as required by the procedures
manual maintained by the administrative official. The administrative official shall prepare a
report with recommendations and shall submit the report to the historic board in advance of
its next scheduled meeting in accordance with the schedule established for agendas and
public notice.
b. Historic board review and action. The historic board shall hold a public hearing on the
application except those for signs and shall review the application with reference to these
regulations, with particular attention to the historic preservation resource protection
standards (section 23-651 et seq.).
1. Except for application for demolitions, the board shall approve with stated conditions or
stipulations, or deny an application with specific reference to the requirements for this
chapter and standards adopted by the historic regulatory board. The board may continue the
hearing until the next regularly scheduled meeting if further information or modifications to
plans for proposed work are requested. However, the board shall make a decision at the
continued hearing unless the applicant agrees to further delay.
2. For applications for building demolitions, the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness
may be delayed for up to sixty (60) days for the purpose of exploring alternatives to
demolition, including relocation of the structure. Upon the request of the historic board, an
additional sixty-day delay may be granted by the city commission with reference to the
criteria for certificates of appropriateness for demolitions under section 23-652. In no
case, however, shall a certificate of appropriateness for a demolition be denied.

Sec. 23-244.2 Variance. A variance is permission granted by the board of appeals to depart
from a dimensional requirement of these land development regulations. Variances are allowed
to relieve a property owner, who, because of property characteristics beyond his control, is
unable to meet a dimensional requirement of these land development regulations. Waivers
granted under various sections of these land development regulations are exempt from the
requirements of this section.
a. Eligibility. An application for a variance may be submitted to the administrative official by
a property owner or his designated agent (by power of attorney) if all of the following criteria
are met:
1. Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or
building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the
same zoning district;
2. The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant;
3. Literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the applicant
of a reasonable use of his property, cause him unnecessary hardship, or deprive him of
other rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners in the same zoning district;
4. The granting of the variance would not confer on the applicant any special privileges
denied to other property owners in the same zoning district;
5. The grant of the request will be harmonious with the general intent and purpose of these
regulations, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare;
6. The application is for a dimensional variance and would not authorize a use otherwise
prohibited by these land development regulations;
60/285
(Ord. No. 2008-04, § 4, 2-19-08; Ord. No. 2016-01, § 5, 01-19-16)
7. The variance is the minimum variance that will allow reasonable use of the property;
8. The application does not meet all of the criteria above, but environmentally sensitive
areas or trees as defined in section 23-215.1 will be saved by the granting of the variance.
b. Application. An eligible applicant may file a request for variance on forms provided by the
administrative official. Such application shall be accompanied by all of the following:
1. The application fee set forth in section 23-242
2. A letter stating what dimensional variance is being requested and specifically identifying
the characteristics of the property that necessitates the granting of a variance from the
requirements of these land development regulations;
3. Reimbursement for costs of public notice;
4. Other information as required by the administrative official.
c. Public notice. Public notice shall be given as required in section 23-241, and the cost of
such notice shall be paid by the applicant prior to board of appeals action on the application.
d. Review and action. The board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on the application. If
the eligibility criteria in paragraph (a) are satisfied, the board may grant the variance as
requested or a modification thereof if more appropriate. If the application is for a variance of
a flood requirement, the variance granted shall comply with drainage requirements of section
23-308
e. Conditions and safeguards. In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate
conditions in conformity with zoning regulations. Violations of such conditions shall be
deemed a violation of these regulations and shall be grounds for revocation of the variance.
Unless otherwise specified by the board, variance approvals shall be in effect throughout the
site plan review process and shall expire when and if the corresponding site plan expires. If
there is no corresponding site plan, the time limit for variance shall expire twelve (12) months
after the effective date of such action unless a building permit has been issued within the
twelve-month period and work is active or the property for which the variance is granted is
within a subdivision under active development. For the purposes of this section, "active" shall
mean that work is continuing without cessation for a period of six (6) months or longer.
f. Limitations on power to grant variances.
1. Under no circumstances shall the board of appeals grant a variance to permit a use not
permitted under the terms of the land development regulations in the zoning district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of these
regulations in the said zoning district.
2. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning
district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in any other district shall be
considered grounds for the granting of a variance.
g. Recording of dimensional variance. All approved dimensional variances, including any
attached conditions or restrictions, shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court at the
applicant's expense. The original record of the dimensional variance shall be filed by the city
clerk in the official records of the city. In the event that the variance expires or is revoked in
accordance with paragraph (e), a notice of variance revocation shall be recorded with the
clerk of the circuit court and the city clerk.

the removal of the applicant tree, the replacement requirement may be waived or
reduced.
1. With the approval of the administrative official, the applicant may elect to place the
required replacement trees in a public open space selected by the city rather than on his
own property in order to supplement or renourish the existing tree population. The
administrative official shall specify the size and species of the replacement trees, not to
exceed the minimum size requirements as stated in paragraph (b).
2 . In lieu of planting required replacement trees, the applicant may elect to make
payment to the city's tree replacement fund. (See Table 23-242 "Land Use Applications
Required Fees" under 23-214 "Tree removal permit".) Funds in the tree replacement
fund shall be reserved for planting plans for public parks and streetscapes, including

of these land development regulations shall be submitted with the preliminary
subdivision plan, planned development project plan or site plan for the purpose of
reviewing the layout of proposed structures and improvements in regard to trees of
significance. The relationship of such trees to the layout shall be considered in the review
of the preliminary plan and changes may be requested or required in the layout as
necessary to preserve such trees as practical while allowing reasonable use of the
property.

Sec. 23-303.2 Street classification system.
a. Street classification system. The street classification system is established consistent with
the Transportation Element and map of the Comprehensive Plan to ensure the expansion of a roadway
network adequate to serve the needs of future development. The roadway functional
classifications group streets and highways according to the character of service they are
intended to provide in relation to the total road network. The Federal Highway Administration
defines the basic categories as follows:
67/285
Functional
System
Services Provided
Arterial Provides the highest level of service at the greatest speed for the longest uninterrupted distance, with
some degree of access control.
Collector Provides a less highly developed level of service at a lower speed for shorter distances by collecting
traffic from local roads and connecting them with arterials.
Local Consists of all roads not defined as arterials or collectors; primarily provides access to land with little
or no through movement.
b. Classification of Lake Wales Streets
Streets providing service within the city are classified as arterials, major or minor collectors, and local roads as
follows:
1. Arterial highways. Arterials are part of a network of continuous routes serving substantial
statewide travel by connecting urbanized areas." The existing arterials within the city
include:
State Road 60
U.S. Highway 27
2 . Major collector roads. A major collector means a street which conducts moderate
volumes of traffic between arterials and minor collectors or local streets and also
provides access to abutting properties. Major collectors shall connect to arterials or
other major collectors at both ends.
Major collectors in and immediately outside of the city that are part of the county
road system include:
Buck Moore Road between Burns Avenue and State Road 60 (CR 17-B)
Burns Avenue, eastward from S.R. 17 (CR 17-A)
Central Avenue between U.S. 27 and S.R. 60
Eleventh Street southward from S. R. 60 (CR 17-B)
Masterpiece Rd. from Buck Moore Rd. to city limit
Mountain Lake Cut-off Road
Chalet Suzanne Road eastward from U.S. 27 (CR 17-A)
State Road 17(Alt. 25)
Thompson Nursery Road westward from U.S. 27
3. Minor collector roads.
Any new minor collector shall connect to another minor collector, an arterials, or a
major collector at each end. Minor collectors shall not be dead-ends and shall not
terminate at a local street.
The city street system includes a gridwork of street classified as minor urban
collectors, including:

4 . Local street. Local streets provide connections between individual properties and
collectors or arterials. A local street is a route that has the function of providing
accessibility to individual parcels of property in residential areas. Local streets carry
light volumes of traffic and should be designed to discourage through traffic and
encourage low vehicular speeds. Local streets existing in the city are all of those street
not listed in this subsection as arterials, major collectors or minor collectors.
Sec. 23-303.3 Street Access Requirements.
a . Adequate access. Approval of any new development or expansion of an existing
development shall be contingent upon provision of adequate access as provided in this
section. "Adequate access" shall be determined by the permitting authority based upon
the standards for streets in this section and in accordance with the concurrency
requirements of article VII, div. 1.
69/285
1. No subdivision or planned development project shall be approved by the City
Commission unless there is adequate access to the property via existing public streets
or a commitment has been made by the applicant or by the city, county, or state in the
applicable capital facilities plan, to render the access adequate to serve the proposed
development at the level of service standards required under article VII of this chapter,
concurrent with development of the property.
2. No building permit or site plan approval pursuant to section 23-222 shall be issued
for construction or placement of a building on a lot unless that lot has adequate access.
Provided the concurrency requirements of article VII are met, access shall be deemed
adequate if the lot has the required frontage on a public street constructed to city
standards or a private street meeting the standards required by the city at the time of its
approval for construction. If the street is unpaved, or does not meet other design
requirements of this section necessary for adequate service to the proposed
development, the administrative official, or the planning board, as applicable, shall
require the applicant to upgrade the street to provide adequate access, unless the
improvements are scheduled by the city, county, or state, and will render access
adequate at the time the proposed structures are occupied.
b. Development access requirements. New development shall not be approved unless the
development has or will have access to streets to serve that development, based on the
following criteria:
1. Commercial, industrial, and professional development.
A. Developments on two (2) acres or less may be accessed from local streets. Where
parcels proposed for development have multiple frontages, access from a side street
is encouraged.
B. Developments on parcels larger than two (2) acres and commercial, industrial, or
professional complexes and subdivisions shall provide a consolidated entrance from
an arterial or major collector road and provide a minor collector road within the
development to access individual lots, buildings, or groups of buildings. The
planning board may require the collector road to meet the standards for a major
collector and may require additional entrances for large developments.
C. No entrance road shall have driveways or parking lot entrances to individual
parcels located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of its intersection with an exterior
roadway.
2. Residential development. Streets within new residential developments shall be
designed to provide local streets within neighborhoods and collector roads to
connect neighborhoods to major collectors and arterial streets, within and outside of
the development.
A. No new residential subdivision or planned development with more than ten (10)
lots or multi-family development with more than twelve (12) units shall be approved
with primary access from a local street.
B. No new residential lots or multi-family buildings shall have direct access to an
arterial or major collector street. Collectors and local streets shall be provided within
such developments for access to individual lots and buildings.
70/285
C. No lots in new residential developments and no new multi-family buildings shall be
approved or permitted on a local street unless the distance via local streets from the site
to a minor collector street or street of higher classification is one thousand two hundred (1,200)
feet or less.
D. A collector street within a new residential development shall meet the standards
for a major collector if it serves five hundred (500) units or more.
Sec. 23-303.4 Entrance roads, intersections and blocks.
a. Entrance road requirements.
1. Distance of cross streets from project entrance. In any residential or non-residential
development, a minimum distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet is required between
the intersection of any entrance road to the development with a roadway exterior to the
project and the intersection of a cross street or parking lot access. In residential
developments with over one hundred (100) dwelling units, the minimum distance shall
be increased by fifty (50) feet for every one hundred (100) dwelling units, rounded off
to the nearest one hundred (100) dwelling units, with a maximum of four hundred
(400) feet.
2. No new residential development or neighborhood with more than fifty (50) dwelling
units shall be approved with only one (1) entrance.
3. Primary entrance roads are those that provide the main access to a residential
development or any entrance from an arterial or major collector street. Secondary
entrances are those that provide access to a residential development in addition to the
primary entrance or entrances. The following standards shall apply to all residential
developments with over fifty (50) dwelling units:
i. An entrance shall be provided to each collector road on which the development has
frontage.
ii. At least one (1) primary entrance shall be provided to a residential development,
except that those with fewer than ten (10) single-family dwelling units or twelve (12)
multi-family dwelling units are not required to meet this requirement unless it is
feasible to extend the entrance street to serve additional development in the future.
iii. Primary entrance roads shall be designed to meet the standards for a minor
collector street, with no driveways to individual lots located on the entrance road.
The required length of a primary entrance road shall be proportional to the number of
dwelling units within the development:
TABLE  DWELLING UNITS AND REQUIRED LENGTH OF ACCESS ROAD
Number of dwellings Length of Primary Entrance Road
(Meeting major collector design standards)
Up to 100 150 feet
100199 200 feet

intersection shall be at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees.
d. Curb radii. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least twenty (20)
feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than seventy-five (75) degrees,
the director of public works may require curb radii of greater length. Wherever necessary
to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without reducing the
sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street
corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such curb
construction.
Sec. 23-303.5 Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac). No collector or arterial street shall be a
dead-end street. Dead-end streets shall not exceed nine hundred (900) feet in length. All
dead-end streets shall have a T or L shaped turnaround area at the terminus unless a
turnaround is required for fire apparatus per the following criteria.
a. Where a cul-de-sac exceeds one hundred (150) feet in length, an approved turnaround
for fire apparatus shall be provided at the closed end. Said turnaround shall have a
minimum centerline radius of fifty (50) feet. Radius measurement shall not include curb,
greenway or sidewalk. A landscaped center island is required. The maximum radius of a
center island on a cul-de-sac with a minimum centerline radius shall be fourteen (14)
feet.
b. Where a cul-de-sac exceeds three hundred (300) feet in length, an approved turnaround
for fire apparatus shall be provided at the closed end. Said turnaround shall have a
minimum centerline radius of sixty (60) feet. Radius measurement shall not include
curb, greenway or sidewalk. A landscaped center island is required. The maximum radius

Sec. 23-303.7 Pavement specifications. Street pavement shall be as required by the
director of public works. Pavement shall be designed to carry the expected traffic loads and
shall conform with current standard specifications for city streets. All street pavements
shall be of a stable type. Loose aggregate will not be considered a completed pavement.
Sec. 23-303.8 Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters shall be provided on all streets.
Vertical curbs shall be not less than six (6) inches in height and Miami curb shall not be
less than three (3) inches in height. All curbs shall conform with the design standards
established by the director of public works. Backfill shall be higher than the curb and shall
slope toward the curb in order to ensure that surface water drains into the storm drainage
system.
Sec. 23-303.9 Sidewalks. Sidewalks constructed in accordance with this section shall be
provided in all new developments and along all streets on which a development has
frontage, unless a specific waiver is granted. City commission approval is necessary for any
waivers of sidewalk construction requested with preliminary subdivision plats or planned
development project plans. Compliance with this section is also required as a condition of
approval of any site plan, including a site plan for a change of use, unless a specific waiver
is granted by the planning board or administrative official as provided in this section.
Planning board approval is required for waivers of sidewalk construction with major site
plans or special exception use permits; the administrative official may grant waivers with
approval of minor site plans and changes of use.
A waiver may be granted in cases where the where the applicable permit granting authority
deems the sidewalk to be unnecessary because of adequate pedestrian accommodations in
the development or neighborhood or deems the cost of the improvement to be
unreasonable in light of the magnitude of the change triggering the site plan review. The
requirement for construction of sidewalks along arterial and major collector roadways may
also be waived where there are no existing sidewalks to extend, provided the developer
contributes funds to the city equivalent to the cost of paving the applicable length of fivefoot
concrete sidewalk, such funds to be used by the city to construct or repair sidewalks
elsewhere within the city. Payments in lieu of construction shall be based upon prices in
contracts currently available for city construction of sidewalks to city standards.
a. Sidewalks shall be provided on at least one (1) side of all local streets and minor
collectors and on both sides of arterials and major collectors. In the C-1 and C-2R
districts, sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the street, regardless of the street
classification.
b. Sidewalks shall be concrete and shall be a minimum of four (4) inches thick.
Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide in residential areas and eight (8) feet
wide in mixed use and non-residential districts.
c. Except in the C-1 district, there shall be at minimum a three-foot wide strip of
landscaped area (as defined in section 23-307) between the sidewalk and curb in which a
tree as defined in section 23-307 shall be planted every fifty (50) feet, at minimum. In
planned development projects where adequate provision for pedestrian circulation is
provided, the requirements of this section may be modified by the approving body.
73/285
d. Sidewalks shall be constructed as part of the street construction in a subdivision or
planned development project unless surety has been accepted by the city commission to
cover the cost of sidewalks, in which case, the sidewalks shall be completed in segments
as adjacent buildings are completed. Certificates of use may be denied on properties
where the sidewalk serving the property has not been completed. As part of the approval
of a permit for a construction or alteration of a structure or parking area, the
administrative official may require the construction or reconstruction of sidewalks in
order to fulfill the requirements of this section.

d. Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to
afford a minimum sight distance of two hundred (200) feet, said sight distance being
measured from a driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half (4½) feet
above the pavement surface, to an object four (4) inches high on the pavement. Profiles
of all streets showing natural and finished grades, drawn to scale, may be required by the
director of public works.
Sec. 23-303.11 Grades. All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of
surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage
facilities. The minimum street grade required for adequate drainage shall be as approved by
the director of public works.
a. The minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.3 percent unless specifically approved by
the director of public works.
74/285
b. Streets shall be designed so as to make them flood-free in order that properties served
by such streets will not be isolated by floods. In flood-prone areas, the director of public
works may require profiles and elevations of streets in order to determine the adequacy
of design. Fill may be permitted by the director of public works provided that it does not
adversely affect flood conditions of the surrounding properties. Street construction shall comply
with Art. IV, Div. 1.Development in Flood Prone Areas as applicable.
c. All streets shall be graded to their full widths so that pavements and sidewalks can be
constructed on the same level plane. Deviation from this standard due to special

2 . Cuts. In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, and other objectionable
materials shall be removed to a depth of at least two (2) feet below the grade surface.
Rock, when encountered, shall be scarified to depth of at least twelve (12) inches
below the graded surface.
3. Fills. In fills, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, soft clay, spongy material
and other objectionable materials shall be removed to a depth of at least two (2) feet
below the natural ground surface. This objectionable material as well as similar
material from cuts shall be removed from the right-of-way area and disposed of in such
a manner that it will not become incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of the
drainage system.
Sec. 23-303.12 Street lighting. Street lights shall be provided along all vehicular and
pedestrian ways in all subdivisions and planned development projects. Light poles shall not
exceed 14 feet in height and shall be located to provide sufficient lighting along all

Division 3. Non-Conforming Uses, Lots, And Structures
§ 23-371. Intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to:
120/285
a. Allow those structures and uses which were lawful before this ordinance was passed
or amended, for which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of
this chapter or future amendments, to remain or continue unless their removal or
discontinuation is required under specific provisions of this chapter, but not to allow
increases in nonconformities where detrimental to the neighborhood or area;
b . Allow expansion of nonconforming one- and two-family structures provided the
expansion is in compliance with applicable dimensional requirements and allow
increases in nonconformity in one- and two-family structures only where such increases
are not detrimental to the neighborhood;
c. allow expansion or change in nonconforming structures and uses only after careful
consideration of the impact of the expansion on the neighborhood;
d. allow a nonconforming use to be changed to another nonconforming use if the new
use is less detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing use;
e. require that when nonconforming uses and structures are allowed to expand or change
to another nonconforming use, the properties are brought into compliance with the
requirements of this chapter to the extent that is reasonable and feasible;
f. prohibit the re-establishment of any nonconforming non-residential use where that use
has been discontinued for a year or more;
g. allow the use of legally nonconforming lots, provided they have not been combined
with adjacent lots.
Sec. 23-371.2 General. Nonconforming uses and structures established illegally shall be
discontinued or removed, as applicable.
§ 23-372. Nonconforming regulations.
The provisions of this section apply to legally nonconforming uses, lots, and structures.
Improvements to a site to increase compliance with this chapter may be required as a
condition of approval under this section.
Sec. 23-372.1 Nonconforming lots. Any lot that does not comply with the dimensional
requirements of the zoning district in which it is located but which met the dimensional
requirements in effect at the time it was created and which was legally platted or otherwise
legally in existance prior to the enactment of requirement(s) with which it does not comply
shall be considered a legal lot for the purposes of building structures, provided the lot has
not been combined with an adjacent lot. A lot shall be considered combined if any of the
following apply:
a. the lot or a portion of the lot was used to meet the dimensional requirements, such as
setbacks, for structure on an adjacent lot;
b. it is in common ownership with an adjacent lot, except that this provision shall not
prohibit the rebuilding of a one- or two-family dwelling on a nonconforming lot and
shall not prohibit the construction of a single-family house on a pre-existing, legally nonconforming
lot whose only non-conformity is lot width at the building line.
Sec. 23-372.2 Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance, a lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so
long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the provisions of this section.
121/285
a. Special exception uses. Uses which require a special exception permit in the district in
which they are located, but which were legally established prior to the requirement for
the special exception use permit shall be considered nonconforming and subject to the
provisions of this ordinance; issuance of a special permit for the use shall render the use
conforming.
b . Expansion of nonconforming uses. Except for one- and two-family uses, no
nonconforming use shall be expanded or extended beyond the scope of its operation, nor
enlarged, increased, extended to occupy a greater area of land or structure than was
occupied at the effective date of the provision of this ordinance with which the use does
not comply, unless a special exception use permit is granted pursuant to section 23-216.
In considering applications for such permits, the board shall consider all aspects of the
proposed change, including changes in the site, structure, and uses. The addition of an
accessory use or structure shall be considered an expansion subject to the requirement
for a permit as described herein. However, an increase in the amount of business
conducted on the site shall not in itself constitute an expansion of the use.
c. Change to another nonconforming use. No nonconforming use shall be changed to
another nonconforming use unless a special exception use permit is granted pursuant to
section 23-216. In considering applications for such permits, the board shall consider all
aspects of the proposed change, including changes in the site, structure, and uses, and
shall not grant such a permit unless a finding is made that the new use is no more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use.
d. Discontinuation of a nonconforming use. If any nonconforming use of land ceases
for any reason for a period of one year, no nonconforming use may be re-established on
those premises, unless a time extension is granted by the planning board prior to the end
of the one-year period. Improvements to the site to increase compliance with this chapter
may be required as a condition of approval of an extension of time. Exempt from this
requirement are single-family and two-family uses; multi-family uses are also exempt,
provided the planning board finds that there is sufficient parking for the use.
Sec. 23-372.3 Nonconforming structures. Where a structure lawfully exists at the
effective date of the adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under
the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or
other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a . A nonconforming one-family or two-family structure may be expanded or changed
provided the nonconformity is not increased. A special permit may be granted pursuant to
section 23-216 to allow an increase in the nonconformity of a one- or two-family
structure only upon a finding that the proposed change is not detrimental to the
neighborhood.
b. No nonconforming structure other than a one-family or two-family structure may be
enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
122/285
c . Except for one- and two-family dwellings, a non-conforming structure that is
destroyed or damaged by any means to any extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its
fair market value, shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter. A non-conforming one- or two-family dwelling damaged by any means to
any extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value may be reconstructed,
provided the building setback requirements are met or the administrative official finds
that the proposed building setbacks are in keeping with those in the immediate
neighborhood and are not less than five (5) feet on the side and ten (10) feet on the rear.
d . Should such a structure be declared unsafe, it may be restored to a safe condition
providing that such restoration does not constitute more than fifty (50) percent of the
structure's appraised fair market value. The fair market value of a sign shall be deemed as
its replacement value. A nonconforming fence shall be removed if more than fifty (50)
percent of its length is declared unsafe or unsound.
(Ord. No. 2007-02, § 11, 3-6-07)
Sec. 23-372.4 Approved construction. Proposed buildings for which building permits
have been issued prior to their designation as nonconforming by the adoption or
amendment of this chapter may be completed and used as originally intended, provided they
are completed and in use one (1) year after the date on which the permit was issued.
Sec. 23-372.5 Rehabilitation construction in CRA Area 3. An owner of a building or
other structure located in the area of the city known as Community Redevelopment Agency
Area 3 shall be permitted to rehabilitate the structure subject to the following:
a . The normal requirements for setback, dimension, parking and landscaping are not
required as a condition of receiving the rehabilitation building permit.
b. The rehabilitation shall not expand or increase in size the structure or building.
c. The terms of this section shall be terminated and become void on the date the city's
land use regulations are adopted as a result of the comprehensive plan.

consistent with the comprehensive plan, including the future land use map and future
land use element goals, objectives and policies. The zoning designation shall be
consistent with the land use category of the future land use map.
b. Land use compatibility. The assigning of zoning districts shall promote compatibility
of adjacent land uses.
c . Adequate public facilities. The assigning of a zoning district designation shall be
consistent with the public facilities available to set the types of uses allowed in the
proposed zoning district. The level of service standards set forth in the comprehensive
plan shall be considered in assigning zoning districts and there shall be reasonable
assurance that the demand for services allowed in the proposed zoning district can be
met.
d. Public interest. Zoning district designations shall not be in conflict with the public

§ 23-405. Correspondence of zoning districts to comprehensive plan land
uses.
Effective: Tuesday, July 07, 2015
Within the comprehensive plan there are "future land use classifications" establishing
general guidelines for the use and development of land, including the types of uses,
intensity of development, and densities to be allowed. The assignment of zoning districts to
land shall promote consistency between the future land use and zoning maps as required
under section 23-404 and shall be the basis for regulation of land use and development.
The following table shall be used as a general guide for zoning district assignments for
various future land use classifications. However, the zoning district assigned to a property
may be more restrictive than the comprehensive plan future land use classification,
provided that the zoning designation allows at least one (1) land use category meeting the
stated intention of the future land use classification.
Any future land use classification may be assigned CN (conservation) or R (recreation)
zoning.

requirements of this section may be granted through the Planned Development Project
(PDP) process pursuant to section 23-224. Residential density shall be in compliance
with the classification of the property as established on the Future Land Use Map and the
Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan.

* The building setback shall be measured from the roof's vertical support member
located nearest to the property line from which the setback is required. The roof
overhang or other projection shall not extend beyond the vertical support member more
than twenty-four (24) inches into the required setback.
1 On any lot approved with reduced frontage, the lot width between the front lot line (street
frontage) and the building line shall not be less than 25 feet at any point. In new singlefamily
subdivisions, up to 10% of the lots may be approved with reduced street frontage,
provided that no frontage is less than 30 feet in width. One single-family house may be
constructed on a panhandle lot with reduced street frontage, provided that, excluding any portion of the
lot less than 50-feet in width, the lot meets the minimum required lot area and other dimensional requirements for
a single-family house in the zoning district, and provided the lot has a minimum of 25
feet of frontage.
2 Minimum floor area of a dwelling unit is the living floor area excluding carports,
garages, breezeways, and unenclosed porches or terraces. For single-family houses on
infill lots, the administrative official may allow a reduction in the floor area to eighty
(80) percent of the area required in the district upon demonstration that the reduced size
is consistent with that of existing houses in the neighborhood.
135/285
3 The minimum front setback shall be as designated or one-half (½) the width of the
required right-of-way for the street on which the lot fronts, whichever is larger. For infill
lots, the administrative official may grant a waiver allowing a reduction of the front yard
setback requirement, provided the reduction is compatible with the building setbacks in
the immediate vicinity.
4 All single-family construction on existing lots less than 51 ft in width and more than
25 ft in width shall have a minimum side setback of 5 ft.
5 See article V for location requirements for accessory structures. Generally, accessory
buildings are permitted only in rear yards at least 5 ft from any lot line.
6 12,000 sq. ft. is required for the first 3 units and 3,000 sq. ft. is required for each
additional dwelling unit.
7 No building shall exceed 3 stories or 45 ft in height unless 1 foot shall be added to the
required front and side setbacks for each foot of building height in excess of 45 ft.
8 Parking areas in the front yard of a single-family or two-family residential property
shall not eliminate more than 50% of the area available for grass or other landscaping.
9 The area encompassing wetlands and/or open water shall not be included in the
calculation for compliance with the minimum lot size requirement.

 The building setback shall be measured from the roof's vertical support member
located nearest to the property line from which the setback is required. The roof
overhang or other projection shall not extend beyond the vertical support member more
than twenty-four (24) inches into the required setback.
1 The minimum front setback shall be as designated or one-half (½) the width of the
required right-of-way for the street on which the lot fronts, whichever is larger. For infill
lots, the administrative official may grant a waiver allowing a reduction of the front yard
setback requirement, provided the reduction is compatible with building setbacks in the
immediate vicinity.
2 A front setback of more than five feet in a C-1 district requires a special permit from
the Planning Board. In deciding upon the permit, the Planning Board shall consider the
consistency of the proposed setback with other buildings within the district and on
adjacent properties.
3 Setbacks in the C-5 districts shall be as approved for the planned development project.
(See section 23-224.) In a C-5 district developed without a planned development project,
the building setbacks shall be as for the C-2 district.
4 A five-foot landscaped buffer meeting the requirements of section 23-307 must be
provided along any rear or side property line adjacent to a residential district.
5 The Planning Board may allow lesser side and rear setbacks adjacent to a residential
district to enable redevelopment or infill. However, a solid buffer shall be provided.
6 The maximum building height may be increased provided one additional foot is added
to each of the required setbacks for each foot of building height in excess of the
maximum specified.
7 The Planning Board may allow a building to exceed the maximum building height in a
C-1, C-2R, or I-2 district following a public hearing and a finding that the proposed
height and architecture of the building are compatible with other buildings in the district
and on properties in the area.
Notes:
Dimensional requirements for the R-3 district apply for residential structures in nonresidential
districts. See Table 23-422A.
Dimensional requirements for accessory structures are set forth in article V.

Division 3. Special Exception Use Regulations
§ 23-431. Special exception uses.
a. Land uses which have the potential of disturbing other land uses in the zoning district
require a special exception permit and discretionary review to ensure that they will be
compatible with the surrounding uses in the zoning district in which they are allowed.
Special exception uses are approved only if, in the specific instance under review, the use
will be compatible with surrounding uses or can be made compatible through limitations
of its operation or enhancements of the site development design.
b. The special exception permit makes the stipulations of approval mandatory and is valid
for the property on which it is issued for as long as the conditions are met, unless the
approval stipulates otherwise.
c . Table 23-421 indicates which uses require special exception permits in the various
zoning districts of the city. Application and approval procedures are provided in section
23-216
§ 23-432. General standards.
All special exception uses shall comply at minimum with the following standards.
Additional requirements may be made by the approving body to ensure compatibility of
uses.
a . All special exception uses shall be subject to the general requirements of these
development regulations for single lot development, structures, lots, yards and vehicular
use area as well as the specific dimensional requirements for lots and structures for the
zoning district in which the special exception use is proposed.
b . If the use is listed as a specific use in article III, division 3, the standards of that
division must be met in addition to other applicable standards.
c . When a particular special exception use requires permitting or licensing by county,
state or federal agencies, no building permit or certificate of use shall be issued until the
applicable county, state or federal permits, licenses or other authorizations have been
presented.
§ 23-433. Review criteria.
a. The permit granting authority for special exception use permits shall use the following
criteria to determine whether a use is appropriate at the proposed location and to formulate
any stipulations of approval deemed necessary to render the use compatible with the
neighborhood. Stipulations of approval that may be imposed by the permit granting
authority are not limited to the types specifically noted in the review criteria.
1. consistency with the comprehensive plan, particularly in regard to the compatibility of
the use with uses allowed under the future land use map classification of land in the
neighborhood, whether those lands have been developed or not.
138/285
2 . the effect of the use on development and economic value of properties, including
undeveloped lands, in the neighborhood.
3 . general compatibility of the use with existing land uses in the neighborhood with
regard to proposed hours of operation, noise, fumes, dust, traffic, glare, dust, vibrations,
and other characteristics. Conditions may be imposed such as requirements for buffers,
noise barriers, additional setbacks, and/or limitations on activities and hours of operation
to lessen impacts.
4 . suitability of building(s) in terms of size, type, and location on the site. Setbacks in
excess of those required for the zone in which the property is located may be required to
lessen the effect of the use.
5. adequacy of parking and ingress/egress to the site and buildings with particular regard
for automobile and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic generation, flow and
control, and emergency access.
6 . refuse and service areas, including loading and unloading facilities and practices, in
regard to location, availability, adequacy, and effect upon surrounding properties.
7 . utilities, in regard to location, availability, adequacy, and effect upon surrounding
properties.
8 . proposed signs and exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety, and
compatibility and harmony with the character of the neighborhood. Restrictions on sign
types, sizes, locations, lighting, materials, and colors may be imposed for the purpose of
increasing compatibility, provided adequate signage is allowed for viability of the
proposed use.
9 . environmental quality of the area in which the use is proposed and the effect the
special exception use might have on such quality.
10. buffering and screening of the use from surrounding properties and from view from
public roads, pathways, and parks.
b . For the purposes of this section, "neighborhood" shall mean the area that the permit
granting authority determines will be affected by the proposed use, and shall not
necessarily be limited to immediately adjacent properties.
§ 23-434. Discontinued use (moved to 23-216.6.b.)
Effective: Tuesday, July 07, 2015
(Ord. No. 2015-04, § 3, 7-7-15)
Division 4. Planned Development Project Regulations
§ 23-441. Applicability.
Planned development project (PDP) approval is required for projects meeting the criteria
set forth in section 23-224.1.
A planned development project (PDP) may be approved in any zoning district through the
process set forth in section 23-224. This section sets forth the standards for PDPs.
139/285
§ 23-442. General standards and regulations.
The PDP process is intended to promote high quality site design, and its use is encouraged.
The process allows flexibility in project layout and relief from standard subdivision grids
in order to preserve natural features of the land, maximize common open space and
landscaping, and create vital neighborhoods. Creativity in housing types and site layout are
encouraged.
Although the PDP process allows flexibility in regard to the requirements of this chapter, a
PDP shall be approved only if the proposed plan demonstrates that the product will be
superior to that of a standard subdivision. The PDP process is not intended to circumvent
the regulations for residential development, but to allow creativity and variety. Deviation
from the provisions of this chapter concerning lot size, setbacks, roadway design, and other
requirements will be granted only if the proposed alternative allows for a superior project
layout, provides enhanced open space and preservation of natural features, does not subvert
the intent of this chapter, and does not compromise public safety.
a . Density and intensity. PDPs may not exceed the density or intensity limitations
established in the Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan for the land use
classification applicable to the property or the density or intensity limitations of the
zoning district in which the property is located.
b . Land uses. Uses within a PDP are limited to permitted and special exception uses
allowed in the zoning district in which the property is located, except that PDPs may
include residential uses in areas where mixed use is a designated use under the Future
Land Use classification of the property in the Comprehensive Plan. See Table 23-421 for
permitted and special exception uses.
c. Development standards.
1. All planned developments shall comply with the provisions of this chapter, including
land development regulations under article III and dimensional requirements for lots
and structures under article IV and V, as applicable, unless specific waivers of
requirements are approved under this section. (Note that a waiver of front yard
requirements for accessory structures on subdivision lots with frontage on both an
exterior and interior streets may be granted pursuant to section 23-522 without PDP
approval.
2. All planned developments shall adhere to the minimum design standards set forth in
this section for the type of PDP proposed.
3 . All planned developments shall be consistent with all of the design guidelines set
forth in this section for the type of PDP proposed. The "methods for achieving" a
design guideline are suggestions; a guideline may be effectively addressed through
other design features, not necessarily listed under a guideline.
d. Waivers. Waivers of specific development standards of this chapter may be granted
under the PDP process, except that the provisions for concurrency pursuant to article
VII, div. 1, for public facilities impact fees pursuant to article VII, div. 4, and for
resource protection pursuant to article VI shall not be waived.
140/285
e. Master Plan. Approval of a master plan of the proposed development, encompassing
the entire property, is required prior to or in conjunction with approval of a preliminary
plan for the first phase of a residential PDP. (See subsection 23-224.2 b)2 for procedural
requirements.) The purpose of the master plan is to establish an overall design for the
development. It is a concept plan, showing generalized features of the project, including
natural features, connections to surrounding roadways and proposed internal circulation,
proposed neighborhoods with acreage and proposed housing types and densities,
proposed open space and recreation areas, the concept for connecting with utilities, and
proposed phasing. Approval of the master plan does not constitute approval of any phase
or the specific number of lots or units to be permitted within any phase.
The master plan must demonstrate that the site design accomplishes the following:
a . Preserves and highlights the natural features of the property; incorporates existing
trees, wetlands, ponds, natural topographic variation, and proposed storm water retention
areas into the site layout and showcases them as design features for common enjoyment;
b . Proposes a coherent network of streets and bike/pedestrian paths connected to
surrounding roadways;
c. Establishes discrete and identifiable neighborhoods and avoids the monotony of long
rows or blocks of units or lots; provides a basis for varied streetscapes;
d . Provides for an identity and privacy for future residents, but does not create a
development that is isolated from the surrounding community.
§ 23-443. Residential PDPs.
Effective: Tuesday, March 17, 2015
Sec. 23-443.1 Minimum design standardsResidential PDPs. The preliminary plan for a
residential PDP shall demonstrate that the site design complies with the minimum design
standards of this section.
a. Density. The number of units per acre shall not exceed the maximum as allowed for
the classification of the property under the Future Land Use Element of the
Comprehensive Plan. Acreage for density calculations shall not include areas of open
water or lands within the "Conservation" classification of the Future Land Use Map.
b . Open space. Excluding roadways and parking areas open space shall make up a
minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the site area. If open space is provided as private
yards for individual units, such yards shall make up only fifty (50) percent of the open
space required. The remaining fifty (50) percent shall be common open space in the
form of recreation area, pedestrian or bicycle paths, or landscaped common areas. The
recreation area required under section 23-310 may be included to meet the open space
requirement except that recreation buildings and parking areas shall not be included.
c . Recreation area. At minimum, recreation area shall be provided as required under
section 23-310
141/285
1. Compensatory recreation area. In residential PDPs where reductions in minimum
lot size are granted, recreation area in addition to that required under section 23-310
shall be required to offset the reductions by provision of recreation area in a ratio of
one to one (total lot size reduction in the development to recreation area added). For
the purpose of calculating required additional recreation area, the lot area reduction
shall be based upon the minimum lot size required in the applicable zoning district,
except that in the R-1A district, the calculation shall be based upon a nine thousand
(9,000) square-foot lot area, as in R-1B.
2. Dry retention area credit. The square footage of a dry retention area may be credited
toward compensatory recreation area provided the retention area is usable and
accessible per the following criteria:
A. Each area has a minimum of 50 feet of street frontage or is adjacent to a park
meeting the standards of section 23-310
B. An access corridor is provided with a minimum width of 25 feet and a slope of no
more than 7 to 1.
C. The retention area is fully landscaped to meet the standards of section 23-310 for
recreation areas.
D. Any portions of the retention area that are behind dwelling units or the back yards
of dwelling units shall not be credited unless they are a minimum of 100 feet in
width, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line.
E. No credit shall be granted for retention areas within easements on lots intended for
the construction of dwelling units.
d. Parking spaces. In single-family and duplex PDPs where reductions in minimum lot
size are granted, and in all multi-family PDPs, visitor parking areas with spaces in a
ratio of one space per 10 dwelling units shall be provided in each neighborhood in
addition to the minimum of 2 parking spaces for each dwelling unit. In projects of 100
units or more, parking spaces shall be provided at the recreation area in a ratio of one
space per ten dwelling units. Recreation area parking in projects with less than 100
units may be used to meet the visitor parking requirement.
e . Building setbacks. The following minimum setbacks for principal buildings are
required: 35 feet from any project property line and 50 feet from any major collector or
arterial road as defined in section 23-303. For a building with more than one story, the
building setback shall be increased by ten feet for each additional story. Exceptions:
1. These requirements shall not apply to single-family houses on lots meeting the
requirements for lot area and lot width at the building line for the zoning district in
which the property lies.
2. The minimum setback from a non-frontage project property line may be reduced for
one-story single-family houses provided the approving authority determines that the
reduction will not adversely impact adjacent property and provided the setback is not
reduced below the minimum setback required for the house in the zoning district in
which the property lies.
3. The minimum front setbacks on a minor collector or local road may be reduced to
allow for a neo-traditional development.
(Ord. No. 2007-33, § 6, 9-4-2007; Ord. No. 2010-07, § 4, 4-20-10; Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1,
3-17-2015)
142/285
Sec. 23-443.2 Design guidelines for residential PDPs. Guidelines in this section are
intended to assist the applicant in designing the project and the city in assessing the quality
of the proposed development.
a . Relationship to surrounding area. The development is not isolated from the
surrounding community, but is an integral part of the community. Methods for
achieving:
Roadways and pedestrian/bike paths connect to the surrounding roadways,
neighborhoods, commercial areas, and parks.
Streets extend or expand the existing street pattern. Collector streets do not terminate
within the development.
Perimeter walls are discouraged in developments with under one hundred (100) units.
In "gated" communities, perimeter walls are inconspicuous and heavily landscaped.
Landscaping has a natural, rather than formalized appearance.
Entrances to the development are understated and do not promote the concept of a
development that is separate from the surrounding community.
Pedestrian connections to surrounding streets are provided through landscaped buffers
and perimeter walls.
b . Overall design. The layout of the development is suited to the configuration and
characteristics of the land and integrates natural features into the overall design. Methods
of achieving:
Natural features of the land, including wetlands, ponds, hills, and vegetation, are
preserved and become the basis for the layout of the development.
Parks and open areas incorporate natural features for the enjoyment of all residents and
become focal points for the development and for neighborhoods.
Roadways provide views of natural features and open space.
Changes in elevation are used as a design feature to provide interest.
Commercial areas in mixed-use developments are located for convenient and safe
access from outside and inside the development by vehicles and pedestrians.
Location of buildings on ridges is avoided so that the rooftops do not dominate the
landscape.
c. Neighborhoods. The development establishes identifiable neighborhoods engendering
a feeling of belonging. Methods of achieving:
Dwellings are clustered rather than located in linear patterns on long streets. The
number of dwellings in each single-family neighborhood does not exceed fifty (50).
Each neighborhood has its own common open space designed as a focal point and
visible from most units. Central greens are encouraged.
Housing styles/types and streetscapes are chosen and designed to distinguish
neighborhoods.
Front porches, small front yards, and walkways connecting to the street provide
opportunities for social interaction.
143/285
d. Streetscapes. Streetscapes are designed to provide interest and variety; views of the
street are attractive from the dwelling units and from the point of view of the
pedestrian walking along the street. Methods of achieving:
Collector roads have landscaped medians or adjacent, landscaped pedestrian/bike
corridors. Driveways intersecting collector roads are minimized.
Visual interest is provided along the street through distinctive landscaping and street
lighting, and varied street and sidewalk patterns.
Location and orientation of houses or buildings on sites provides variety and
distinctiveness to the street.
Building facades and entrance features are varied.
Building sizes and types are designed specifically for the lot size and shape.
Setbacks between houses are varied or breaks are provided in rows of houses for visual
relief.
Mini-parks, neighborhood parks, and open space areas are located and landscaped to
provide rest stops for pedestrians and to visually punctuate the streetscape. Benches or
retaining walls provide seating.
Spine roads and long sections of local streets meander and are attractively landscaped
Long blocks are broken up with landscaped islands.
Plantings are chosen to distinguish the street or neighborhood from others.
Streets are oriented to provide views of open areas and vistas from hillsides.
Intersections have landscaping and design features to add interest and shield houses on
corner lots.
Clutter along the street is minimized in dense neighborhoods by grouping mail boxes
and trash collection stations, keeping signage to a minimum, and providing visitor
parking areas.
See also Lighting.
e. Street system. A well-planned street system establishes coherence to the development,
provides safe and efficient circulation for vehicles and pedestrians, and defines
neighborhoods. Methods of achieving:
A hierarchy of streets is established, providing a coherent circulation system; a maze of
local streets is avoided.
Loop roads and branches from a spine road provide access to neighborhoods. The use
of culs de sac is minimized.
Streets within neighborhoods are designed to provide unity and definition to the
neighborhood.
Streets are designed to allow for expansion of the development into nearby areas via
collector roads.
f . Pedestrian circulation. A comprehensive system of sidewalks and bike paths
throughout the development connects dwelling units to recreation areas, parking areas,
public transportation stops, common buildings, and adjacent neighborhoods, and
provides a safe and attractive walking environment for recreational and practical use.
144/285
The pedestrian/bike circulation system is planned as an integral part of the overall
design of the development, providing connections between dwelling units and all
facilities in the development.
Pedestrian/bike paths running along streets are buffered from the travel ways of streets
by landscaped strips.
Pedestrian/bike paths are designed as recreational features or to double as recreational
features. Paths that are separate from the vehicular ways are encouraged, provided they
are in landscaped corridors and there are sufficient connections between dwelling units
and likely destinations.
Paths meander through landscaped areas providing alternative routes for recreational
walks and visual variety for the pedestrian; paths do not run unvaryingly parallel to
streets.
Paths provide views of open areas, water bodies, wetlands, landscaped areas, streets,
and neighborhoods.
g. Focal points and gathering places. Attractive and distinctive focal points and places
for residents to gather, meet, and enjoy the outdoors are provided in the development.
In keeping with a principle of Frederick Law Olmsted, the best part of the site is kept
for the public. Methods of achieving:
In addition to neighborhood and mini-parks, recreation areas are provided to serve the
entire community; these are located for easy access by all residents and incorporate and
enhance natural features (whether existing or created), such as water bodies and groves
of trees.
Landscaped areas double as recreation areas.
Recreation areas are designed to encourage gathering and interaction of residents. Path
intersect, and benches or picnic areas are provided at intersections; gazebos, plazas,
community buildings, playgrounds, picnic areas, seating near play courts, or similar
facilities are provided.
In mixed-use developments, green areas are used to connect and integrate residential
and mixed-use or commercial/professional areas.
Small parks provide focal points and gathering places within each neighborhood or for
a group of neighborhoods.
Facilities in common areas are provided appropriate to the residents' ages and interests.
Playgrounds, play courts, community buildings, bike paths, swimming pools, jogging
paths, are examples.
h . Landscaping. Landscaping in the development provides visual interest, screening
where needed, incorporates existing mature trees and other valuable vegetation,
enhances natural features such as wetlands, and minimizes water use. Methods of
achieving:
An overall landscaping concept is prepared for the development with attention to
streetscape, plantings in recreation and common areas, attractive landscaping around
buildings and in yards, retention of existing trees, and appropriateness of plant
selections to the environment.
Streets, lot lines, and building envelopes are located to preserve existing trees,
particularly in parks, front yards and in landscaped islands and street edges.
145/285
Native plant types and low water use species are used extensively.
Rear yards are buffered from roadways by landscaped buffers. A proliferation of
individual privacy fences along streets is avoided.
Landscaping is provided to screen lots where a double line of lots is located so that
back yards or side yards abut.
Where side building setbacks are small, plant materials are placed to screen side lot
lines from the street.
All dumpsters and other mechanical facilities are screened attractively.
Frameworks for plants to grow on, such as trellises or arbors, are provided in parks and
yards.
Existing or new large-caliper trees are used at focal points, providing the immediate
impact of mature trees.
i. Parking and access. Sufficient provision is made for resident and visitor parking and
access for services, such as deliveries and garbage pick-up, without street congestion or
interference with sidewalks. Parking facilities do not dominate the streetscape. Methods
for achieving:
Garages are recessed or oriented so that garage doors do not face the street.
Driveways run along the side of dwellings or extend to the back of the dwelling.
Parking areas are located to the side and rear of buildings; parking areas along street
frontages are minimized.
Parking areas are set back from the road and are screened with landscaping, fences, or
berms.
Small pods of parking are designed rather than large parking lots.
There is adequate street width where street parking is permitted.
Alleys provide service access and additional parking.
Driveways to dwellings are of adequate length to provide parking without vehicles
encroaching on sidewalk.
Additional parking is provided for visitors and for recreation areas.
j. Lighting. Lighting is adequate for safety and enhances the streetscape, residential sites,
parking areas, signs, and recreation facilities without being excessive or creating glare.
Methods for achieving:
Light fixtures are directed downward to the areas targeted for illumination and do not
create glare.
Decorative lighting is provided in recreation areas and along streets and pedestrian
paths.
Signage is illuminated by upward directed spot lights and is not internally lit.
Bus stops, trash receptacles, mailboxes, and other facilities are well lit and accessed by
pedestrian paths.
k . Neighborhood scale. Buildings are of appropriate scale for the lot or site and are
compatible with adjacent existing or proposed development. Methods for achieving:
146/285
Architectural styles are chosen or guidelines are developed for each neighborhood in
keeping with the lot sizes and layout in the neighborhood.
Multi-family buildings are broken into house-size building elements, especially where
there is a building height transition from adjoining development.
Open space and landscaping separate neighborhoods or buildings with different scales.
Infill development is of the same scale as existing development in the neighborhood.
Where proposed buildings are larger than existing buildings, the mass of the building is
set back from the street, and the portion of the building along the street is compatible
in scale with adjacent buildings.
Upper story planter boxes and roof plantings are provided for interest.
l . Privacy, safety, and security. Buildings and neighborhoods are designed to provide
privacy, safety, and security for residents. Methods for achieving:
Window placement and landscaping provide privacy between houses, particularly on
lots with small side yard setbacks.
Upper floors are stepped back to increase the distance of windows from the property
lines.
Side and rear setbacks are not uniform; a side setback on one (1) side of a house is
greater than on the other.
A greater side setback is provided for two-story houses than for one-story.
Front windows provide views of streets and neighborhood parks.
Rear yards are screened from adjacent rear yards through careful building
configuration and landscaping.
Neighborhoods are small and have distinct entrances to promote a neighborhood
identity and a sense of belonging for residents.
Where street parking is permitted, sidewalks are provided.
(Ord. No. 2006-24, § 15, 6-6-2006)
§ 23-444. Commercial, industrial, and professional PDPs.
Sec. 23-444.1 Minimum design standards.
a . Intensity. The PDP may not exceed the limits of intensity set forth in the
Comprehensive Plan for the Future Land Use classification of the property where the
PDP is proposed.
b . Building setbacks. Principal buildings shall be set back thirty-five (35) feet from
adjacent residential uses and zones and twenty (20) feet from other external property
lines except front property lines. Principal buildings fronting on roads exterior to the
project shall adhere to the front setback required in the zoning district where the project
is located.
c . Buffers. A ten-foot wide, landscaped separation strip shall be provided along all
property lines abutting a residential use or zone. Within this strip, a permanent visual
screen, such as a wall or evergreen hedge, with a minimum height of six (6) feet shall be
provided.
147/285
Sec. 23-444.2 Design guidelines.
a . Relationship to surrounding area. The development is not isolated from the
surrounding community, but is an integral part of the community. The site plan for the
development is complementary to site features of surrounding development and does not
create incompatible juxtapositions. Methods for achieving:
Pedestrian and bike paths connect the development with surrounding residential and
non-residential land uses and with pedestrian and bike paths along roadways in the
vicinity of the project.
Cross access easements, roadway connections, and location of entrances facilitate
vehicular access to the development from residential and non-residential land uses in
the area surrounding the project.
Open space in the development is connected to open space and parks in adjacent
development.
The backs of buildings, loading docks, outdoor storage areas, and dumpsters are
located away from surrounding residential and other sensitive uses and are screened
with attractive landscaping and/or fencing from adjacent uses and roadways.
Distance and solid fencing reduce noise from such uses as dumpsters and loading
docks.
The scale, architectural style, and location of buildings is chosen to be compatible with
surrounding development and to provide transitions from large or massive buildings to
surrounding land uses, particularly single-family development.
b. Natural features of land. The layout of the development is suited to the configuration
and characteristics of the land and integrates natural features into the overall design.
Methods of achieving:
Natural features of the land, including wetlands, ponds, hills, and vegetation, are
preserved and become the basis for the layout of the development.
Open areas incorporate natural features become focal points for the development.
Site layout allows views of natural features and open space from project entrances and
public spaces such as restaurants and outdoor plazas.
Changes in site elevation are used as a design feature to provide interest.
c. Unified concept. The project creates an attractive and pleasant grouping of buildings
with a unique identity and sense of place for employees and clients; buildings are not
lined up parallel to the roadway with a large parking lot in front. Methods for achieving:
Buildings have architectural harmony and are located in functional and attractive
groupings.
A design concept for the development, including out-parcels, promotes functional and
architectural coherence. The concept addresses the relationships of buildings in terms
of appearance and access by vehicles and pedestrians, includes plazas for outdoor
gatherings, incorporates open space and natural features into the design, and provides
attractive landscaping throughout.
Outparcels are situated to complement the overall design and do not visually dominate
the project frontage.
148/285
Parking areas are designed for both convenience and attractiveness. Large areas of
asphalt are avoided through sectioning off small parking areas, using landscaped
separation strips, and through creative site layout.
Signage and landscaping are planned to unify buildings and uses and to promote design
coherence to the whole project.
The development has a unifying feature or features, such as a central plaza, giving a
sense of overall design and providing places for outdoor events and social interaction.
The site layout and landscaping avoids the appearance from the street of a huge,
unrelieved parking lot.
d . Circulation. The development is easily accessible to vehicles, bicycles, and
pedestrians. Methods for achieving:
Vehicular entrances and access roads do not direct traffic entering the site directly to
the front of the building, but to parking aisles.
The site design integrates parking among the buildings or wraps parking around two
(2) or more sides of buildings rather than consolidating all parking spaces in a large
parking area that is segregated from the building(s).
Multiple pedestrian access points to a group of buildings and adjacent parking areas
avoids vehicular congestion at the front of a building and competition for parking near
one (1) entrance.
The distance from any parking space to a building entrance is minimized; optimum
distance: less than one hundred fifty (150) feet.
Parking aisles are short and wide to allow safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles.
Bicycle lanes or paths are provided from adjacent bike paths and local streets; bike
racks are provided close to buildings.
Walkways, separate from vehicular ways are provided for pedestrians.
e. Landscaping and lighting. An attractive and pedestrian-scale atmosphere is created
through abundant landscaping and pleasant, unobtrusive lighting. Methods for achieving:
Landscaped areas create green corridors through and around parking areas, breaking up
large areas of parking.
Large caliper trees are preserved or planted in selected focal areas to provide
immediate mature landscaping.
Lighting poles are decorative, low, and directed downward to light parking areas and
pedestrian paths.
Landscaped areas are combined with pedestrian paths.
Tree locations and species are chosen to provide shade in parking areas and plazas.
Outdoor eating areas are located in areas specifically designed for them, such as plazas
between buildings or open areas distant from high vehicular traffic.

§ 23-445. Mixed-use PDPs.
149/285
Effective: Wednesday, September 19, 2018
Mixed-use PDPs are allowed in C-1, C-2R, C-5, and PF zoning districts, and in the C-2
and C-3 zoning district where allowed under the land use classification on the Future Land
Use Map of the Comprehensive Plan. Mixed-use developments in C-2R and PF zoning
districts may be approved through the site plan process set forth in 23-222 unless there are
multiple principal buildings, in which case, PDP approval is required.
Sec. 23-445.1 Minimum standards.
a . Density and intensity. Mixed-use developments shall not exceed the density and
intensity limits for the Future Land Use designation of the property as set forth in the
Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan.
Except in the C-1 (downtown) and C-5 (village center) districts, the maximum nonresidential
square footage allowed in a mixed-use development shall be determined by
the following formula: Two thousand five hundred (2,500) times the maximum
number of dwelling units allowed on the property per the Future Land Use
Classification. Where fewer units are proposed than the maximum number of dwelling
units allowed, an additional two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet of nonresidential
area shall be added for each unit allowed, but not proposed.
b. Building setbacks. Except in developments in the C-1 (downtown) and C-5 (village
center) districts, principal buildings shall be set back fifty (50) feet from adjacent
residential uses and zones and twenty (20) feet from other property lines except front
property lines. In all districts, principal buildings fronting on an arterial or major
collector road exterior to the project shall adhere to the front setback required in the
zoning district where the project is located.
c . Buffers. Except in developments in the C-1 (downtown) and C-5 (village center)
districts, a ten-foot wide, landscaped separation strip shall be provided along all property
lines abutting a residential use or zone. Within this strip, a permanent visual screen, such
as a wall or evergreen hedge, with a minimum height of six (6) feet shall be provided.
d . Recreation. Except in the C-1 district, recreation areas shall be provided per the
requirements of section 23-310
Sec. 23-445.2 Design guidelines for mixed use PDPs except village centers. (See section
23-445.3 for design guidelines for village centers.)
The design guidelines for residential and those for commercial, industrial, and professional
PDPs shall also apply to mixed use PDPs. In addition, dwelling units within a mixed-use
development provide tenants with a setting and amenities appropriate for residential use;
apartments do not appear as an afterthought in the development.
Methods for achieving:
Dwelling units are located away from busy roadways or are shielded from traffic noise
by solid fencing and landscaping.
Outdoor space for recreation is located conveniently for the use of residents and provides
facilities for their enjoyment.
The site layout and landscaping provides for the safety and privacy of residents.
Sec. 23-445.3 Design guidelines for village centers (C-5 districts).
150/285
a. Overall concept. A village center is a commercial, business, and social center with the
characteristics of a traditional downtown. Its primary focus is serving residents in the
surrounding residential area though it may have businesses that attract patrons from the
larger community. Methods for achieving:
The center contains a variety of uses catering to residents, such as convenience stores,
barber shops and hair salons, dry cleaning businesses, restaurants, branch banks, and
video rental stores.
Mixed use buildings containing businesses and residences, as well as residential
buildings, are included in the village center. Residential densities decrease with
distance from the center, providing a transition to low density residential areas.
Buildings are arranged in a compact configuration with a pedestrian orientation.
Public spaces, such as plazas and central greens, provide focal points, informal
gathering places, and opportunities for special events.
The village center is designed to serve the pedestrian rather than the vehicle.
b . Access and circulation. Access to the village center is safe and convenient for
pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles from nearby residential areas as well as exterior
roadways; the village center is oriented for the pedestrian rather than the vehicle.
Access to the village center from surrounding residential areas is safe and convenient
for pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles.
Bike racks are provided close to businesses and parks.
A major or minor collector provides access from exterior roadways to the village
center and provides a transition to minor collectors and local streets within the village
center.
The village center streets have low speed limits and a comprehensive system of
sidewalks and crosswalks.
Peripheral parking areas are provided; street parking is permitted.
Parking areas are located to the side and rear of buildings and serve multiple
businesses.
c. Open space. Open space in the village center provides recreation for its residents and
visitors and provides areas for special events. Methods for achieving:
Parks and open space provide connections between residential areas and the village
center.
Plazas, greens, neighborhood parks, and mini-parks are centrally located within the
village center.
Benches, gazebos, landscaping, decorative lighting and other facilities are provided to
encourage social interaction and enjoyment of open space in the village center.
Outdoor eating areas are provided away from vehicular traffic and adjacent to public
spaces.
d . Streetscape. The village center streetscape is similar to the traditional downtown.
Methods for achieving:
Buildings are located close to streets and have direct access to the sidewalk.
151/285
Streets have sidewalks with low, decorative lighting, street trees, and street furniture.
Less than thirty (30) percent of the street frontage is occupied by parking areas.
Architectural guidelines ensure that all buildings in the village center are compatible in
style and scale. No large scale buildings dominate the streetscape.
(Ord. No. 2018-07, § 5, 09-19-18)
Article V. Accessory Uses And Structures
Division 1. General Provisions
§ 23-501. Generally.
Accessory uses and structures are permitted in all zoning districts subject to the restrictions
contained in this article. The types of accessory uses and structures permitted are
determined by the principal use of the property rather than by the zoning district in which
the property lies. As an example, a residential property in a commercial zone would be
allowed the uses and structures designated in this article as uses and structures permitted
for residential buildings. Additional regulations may be required according to the zoning
district of the property.
Residential properties are premises used primarily for dwellings.
Both accessory uses and accessory structures must be subordinate to the principal use or
structure. Accessory uses shall involve no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the
building or property, as applicable, where the use takes place. Accessory structures shall be
governed by specific limits in this article and in no case shall exceed fifty (50) percent of
the area of the principal structure or of the property, as applicable, occupied by the
principal use.
a. Accessory uses.
1 . Uses which do not comply with the restrictions for accessory uses shall be
considered principal uses and shall be subject to the permitting requirements of these
land development regulations for the zoning district in which the property lies. See
Table 23-421 for permitted and special exception uses allowed in each zoning district.
2 . Unless otherwise stated in these land development regulations, verification of
zoning compliance and a certificate of use under section 23-212 and 23-213 are not
required for the addition of an accessory use listed in Table 23-521 for residential
properties or Table 23-541 for non-residential properties. If the accessory use is not
listed on the applicable table, the administrative official must make a determination
whether the proposed use qualifies as an accessory use by virtue of its being a use
customarily incidental to the principal use of the property.
3 . Addition of an accessory use to a property where the principal use is a special
exception use under article IV requires a special exception use permit pursuant to
section 23-216
4 . Additional requirements may apply to the addition of accessory uses if either the
principal use or the accessory use is regulated under article II, div. 2, specific use
regulations.
b. Accessory structures.
152/285
1 . Verification of zoning compliance pursuant to section 23-212 is required for the
construction or location of any accessory structure. A site plan and other information
to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter may be required by the
administrative official prior to issuance of a building permit for an accessory structure.
2. An accessory structure may be located on a lot where no principal structure exists
only upon the approval of a special exception use permit granted pursuant to section
23-216
3 . Accessory structures on mixed-use properties (with both residential and nonresidential
uses) shall comply with the requirements for residential properties unless a
special exception permit is granted by the planning board pursuant to section 23-216.
Non-residential properties with accessory apartments shall not be classified as mixeduse
properties for the purposes of this section.
4. Accessory structures with non-rigid roofs, such as tents, are not permitted except on
a temporary basis, not to exceed four (4) weeks per calendar year.
5 . Temporary accessory structures, including trailers, tents, and modular units, for
occupation or storage use during construction, reconstruction, or repair of a principal
structure may be permitted by the administrative official for specific time periods,
subject to compliance with all applicable building codes.
Division 2. Residential Accessory Uses And Structures

§ 23-522. Accessory structures, residential properties.
Effective: Wednesday, September 19, 2018
See subsection 23-501(b)3. for accessory structures on mixed-use properties.
a . Location and setbacks. Accessory structures on residential properties shall not be
located within the front yard except as otherwise noted and shall maintain a five-foot
setback from any side or rear property line, except as otherwise noted.
b. Waiver of front yard requirements. Where lots within a subdivision have functional
rear yards backing up to an exterior street and have functional front yards gaining access
from an interior street, the planning board may grant approval for the functional rear yard
to be considered a rear yard for the purposes of accessory structure locations and
setbacks, provided a landscaped buffer is approved along the exterior street. The buffer
shall be designed to provide a solid, continuous, screen of at least four (4) feet in height
within two (2) years of planting. The buffer shall be as approved by the planning board,
and shall meet the minimum standards for a "buffer along streets exterior to a
development" in subsection 23-307.2.b.

details the proposed fence construction, including fence location in relation to property lines and easements, as well as
any other information deemed necessary by the administrative official for reviewing the application.
b. Dimensional requirements. Fences and hedges shall be located a minimum of 3 feet from the property line along an
alley. Otherwise, they are not subject to setback requirements and may be located anywhere within the property lines,
provided the height limitations set forth in Table 23-524 are met.
The planning board may waive the height requirements for a valid purpose related to compatibility with the character
of the neighborhood, addressing problems with slope or architecture, or screening an adjacent land use. Fences
required for compliance with a permit granted by an agency for structures such as retention ponds are exempt from
height restrictions. The administrative official may grant a waiver for fence height in a functional side-yard from 4

NOTATION
See paragraph (c), materials.
Measured from the edge of the pavement or travel way.
c. Materials.
1. Fence materials must be generally compatible with surrounding properties. Traditional
materials such as wood, masonry, wrought iron, or other metal are preferred materials for
fences in front yards. Fences constructed of vinyl or other plastic materials are not
permitted as the exterior perimeter wall of a development. Chain link and solid fences such as
stockade fences may be located in front yards provided shrubs are planted and maintained
along the side of the fence facing any public right-of-way. Such shrubs must be at least two
and one-half (2½) feet in height at the time of planting and shall be planted as a continuous
hedge or shall be spaced a maximum of fifteen (15) feet apart. Chain link and solid fences
constructed behind the front building line and parallel to the right-of-way must also be
landscaped per these requirements, unless the administrative official determines that
screening is not necessary because of site topography, adequate existing landscaping in the
front yard, short length of fence, sufficient setback behind the building line, or other

may be used on top of a fence a minimum of six (6) feet in height. Barbed wire may also be
used on agricultural lands.

§ 23-545. Signs.
The purpose of this section is to establish a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of
signs on non-residential properties in the city. These regulations are designed to protect and
promote the public health, safety, and welfare by controlling the type, number, location,
and physical dimensions of signs to prevent the disruptions, obstructions, and hazards to
vehicular and pedestrian traffic that signs may cause, and to enhance the quality of the
environment in residential and non-residential districts. More specifically, it is the purpose
of this section to:
a. Implement the comprehensive plan and planning policies of the city;
b. Provide liberally for the free expression of ideas through signs in the city;
c. Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication;
d. Balance the desire and need of individuals to express their creativity in signs with the
desire to maintain a pleasing visual environment for residents and visitors;
e. Protect and enhance the value of properties and to have a signage appropriate to the
planned character and development of each area in the city;
f. Balance the need for information for motorists and pedestrians with the need for traffic
safety by limiting signs or characteristics of signs that may be particularly distracting to
drivers;
g. Provide clear and objective sign standards;
h. Provide a clear and efficient review procedure for sign applications; and
i. Enable fair and consistent enforcement of the regulations set forth in this section.
169/285
Sec. 23-545.1 Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to all signs on
nonresidential properties in the city. Placement of a sign anywhere in the city shall require
a permit unless the type of sign is specifically exempted from the requirement for a permit
under section 23-545.4. For the purposes of sign regulation, a "permit" shall mean
"verification of zoning compliance" under section 23-212. To "place" a sign shall mean
construct, paint, install, erect, post, sculpt, project, or otherwise display. Placement of a
sign may also require a building permit. A permit is not required for a change in the
message on an existing sign provided that the new message is not a commercial message
where only a non-commercial message is allowed and provided there is no change in the
structural components of the sign.
a. Definition of sign.
Sign. Any device, structure, fixture, painting, or visual image using words, graphics,
symbols, numbers, or letters, designed and/or used for the purpose of communicating a
message or attracting attention.
b . Exclusions. The following are not considered signs for the purposes of regulation
under this section:
1. Decorations or displays of non-commercial nature.
2. Cornerstones, foundation stones and memorial signs or tablets displaying the names
of buildings and date of erection, when cut into any masonry surface or inlaid so as to
be part of the building or when constructed of bronze or other incombustible material.
Sec. 23-545.2 General regulations for signs on non-residential properties.
a. Sign allowance.
1 . Each developed non-residential property shall be allowed signs subject to the
provisions of table 23-545, "LOCATION, AREA, AND HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS
FOR SIGNS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL USES."
2. Individual units in a business complex shall be allocated wall signs in proportion to
their building frontage based on the formula in table 23-545, unless allocation is
otherwise set forth in the approved master signage plan filed by the owner under section
23-545.3. Allocation of space on a business complex wall or ground sign shall be the
prerogative of the owner, subject to the lettering size requirements in table 23-545
b . Commercial and non-commercial messages. Signs allowed on table 23-545 may
display a commercial or non-commercial message. Other signs allowed on non-residential
properties may display a commercial message only if specifically stated in the provision
allowing the sign. "Commercial message" is defined as follows:
Commercial message means a sign, wording, logo, or other representation that, directly
or indirectly, names, advertises, or calls attention to a business, product, service or other
commercial activity or to an institution or other non-residential activity or use. For the
purposes of sign regulation, the following are not considered commercial activities:
proposed sale, rental or lease of the real estate where the message is displayed, the
incidental and occasional sale of personal property on site, residential yard sales held in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, and construction/renovation on site.
Sec. 23-545.3 Design. It is the intent of these regulations to promote high quality design in
signage. The administrative official may provide guidelines to assist applicants in
designing signage, and the city may adopt guidelines separate from this chapter for use in
reviewing and deciding upon "master signage plans" and signs in C-1 zoning districts.
170/285
a . Master plan for signage. A master plan for signage shall be required for any
nonresidential development with more than one (1) principal building, for business
complexes, shopping centers, and for buildings with multiple tenants. For the purpose of
sign regulation, multi-tenant properties shall be referred to as "business complexes." The
purpose of a master plan for signage is to promote high quality signs and design
consistency within a development.
The plan shall be submitted with a site plan application pursuant to section 23-222.
Proposed design standards, including sizes, styles, colors, lighting, and placement shall
be provided for the purpose of demonstrating consistency among the signs on the
property. At the discretion of the owner, the master plan may provide for a share of the
wall sign and ground sign allowance for tenants in the business complex.
A master signage plan shall be approved by the administrative official if it provides for
consistency of sign type, lighting, placement, size, and style for the business complex
sign (if proposed), tenant signs, and other signs proposed on the property and meets all
other applicable requirements of this chapter. A certificate of appropriateness for the
master signage plan is required for properties within the Downtown Historic District.
(See section 23-227.)
Approved master plans for signage shall govern all signage for the project, including
"outparcels." Amendments to the plan may be approved by the administrative official
or referred to the planning board for review if the master signage plan was approved by
the planning board as part of the site plan process.
For existing business centers or buildings with multiple tenants, a master plan for
signage shall be required with any application for a sign, including any sign for an
individual unit or tenant. All new or modified signs shall comply with the master plan
as approved. The plan shall include a schedule for bringing all signs into compliance
with the master plan.
b . Business complex signage. A "business complex" sign is allowed for a business
complex, provided that the name of the building or shopping center is displayed
prominently on the sign. A bonus in size is granted for a business complex ground sign.
See table 23-545 for dimensional and other requirements.
"Business Complex" ground signs are encouraged in lieu of multiple ground signs for
out-parcels. If "business complex" signs display the names of individual businesses
within the complex, the master plan must contain design requirements for the listings.
For buildings with multiple businesses, a wall sign with tenant listings and a clearly
stated name for the building is encouraged in lieu of individual wall signs or a ground
sign with a listing of tenants.
Sec. 23-545.4 Exempt signs. The following signs are exempt from the requirement for a
permit and do not count against the sign allowance for the property:
a. Incidental signs not directed at or legible or visible by persons off-site.
b. Signs required by law or deemed necessary by the administrative official for safety or
warnings, including traffic signs and street address numbers.

Division 1. Development In Flood Prone Areas
§ 23-601. GENERAL [Repealed & Reenacted]
Effective: Tuesday, October 18, 2016
a. Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of City of Lake Wales, hereinafter referred to
as this Division.
b. Scope. The provisions of this Division shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area,
including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction,
alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that
are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings;
installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development.
180/285
c. Intent. The purposes of this Division and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building
Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:
(1) Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding;
(2) Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage;
(3) Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and
other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;
(4) Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the
natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain;
(5) Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas;
(7) Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood
events; and
(8) Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44
Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.
d. Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with
the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building
Code.
e. Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this
community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that
land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or
flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance
Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance
with this ordinance.
f. Disclaimer of Liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Lake Wales or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
(Ord. No. 2016-19, § 2, 10-18-16)
§ 23-601.1. Definitions.
The following terms are defined for use in carrying out the provisions of this section.
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the
perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing
wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a
firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the administrative official's interpretation of any
provision of this section or a request for a variance.
181/285
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or VO Zone on a Community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where
a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to
a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Base flood means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood" and the "regulatory flood").
Base flood is the term used throughout this section.
Base flood elevation means the highest water-surface elevation associated with the base
flood.
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building
and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral
loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or the
supporting foundation system.
Building. See structure
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment.
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated
above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings,
columns (posts and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters or the unusual
and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.

on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of the Lake Wales area on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium
zones applicable to the community.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by
FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FHBM (where
applicable) and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding.

top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame
construction. The terms does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking
vehicles.

Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for
purposes of flood plain management.
Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking
or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers,
shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include
long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
Hardship, (as relating to variances of the provisions of this section) means the
exceptional hardship associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the
requested variance. A hardship must be unusual and peculiar to the property involved.
Financial hardship alone is not considered exceptional. Inconvenience aesthetic
considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the
alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put
the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior
to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement).
An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest
floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation
of the non-elevation design standards of this ordinance.

were complete (including at minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) was completed
before 1988, the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted
by the City of Lake Wales. Such a park or subdivision is considered "new" if it was or
is commenced after that date.
Expansion of an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities,
the construction or streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads.)
Market value means the building value, excluding the land as established by what the
local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent
certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of the building, or adjusted
assessed values.
183/285
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as
a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this
chapter, the term is synonymous with national vertical datum (NGVD).
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control
used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: built on a single chassis, four hundred
(400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, designed to
be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and designed primarily
not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a temporary living quarters for recreational,
camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Start of construction refers to substantial improvement and means the date the building
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or
improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date.
The "actual start" of construction means the first placement of permanent construction of
a building (including manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or
footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
"Permanent" construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading,
and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main building.
For substantial improvements, the actual start of construction means the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tanks and
manufactured homes, that are principally above ground.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed
fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. The
administrative official may require verification of the "market value" in making a
determination of "substantial improvement" or "substantial damage."
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, taking place within a calendar year, the cumulative cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the "market value" of the structure before
the "start of construction" of the improvement or, in the case of repairs, before the
damage occurred. The administrative official may require verification of the "market
value" in making a determination of "substantial improvement" or "substantial damage."
The term "substantial improvement" also includes structures that have incurred
"substantial damage" or "repetitive loss" regardless of the actual repair work performed.
This term does not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for, permit for
improvement and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
184/285
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits
construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section and which is based on a
finding that specific enforcement of the provisions of this section would result in a
hardship.

or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration and enforcement of this Division. Any person
aggrieved by the decision may appeal such decision to the Circuit Court, as provided by Florida Statutes.
c. Limitations on authority to grant variances. The board of appeals shall base its decisions on variances on technical
justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in section 23-607(g), the conditions of issuance set forth in
section 23-607(h), and the comments and recommendations of the Floodplain Administrator and the Building Official. The board of
appeals has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this Division.
d. Restrictions in floodways. A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base
flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in section 23-605(c).
191/285
e. Historic buildings. A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that
is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing
Building, Chapter 12 Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not
preclude the buildings continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the buildings continued designation as a historic
building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the
requirements of the Florida Building Code.
f. Functionally dependent uses. A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary
for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this Division, provided the variance meets the requirements of section
23-607(d), is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods
and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood.
g. Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the board of appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this Division, and the
following:
(1) The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on
current and future owners;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community;
(5) The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion;
(6) The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development;
(7) The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area;
(8) The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects
of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(10) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.
h. Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon:
(1) Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size,
configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this Division or the required elevation
standards;
(2) Determination by the board of appeals that:
(a) Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land
that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute
hardship;
(b) The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws and ordinances; and
192/285
(c) The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
(3) Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of
the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and
(4) If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a
building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the
applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the
lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below
the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

extends past the boundaries of private property.
Division 5. Historic Preservation
§ 23-651. Purpose and intent, findings of fact.
The purpose and intent of this division is to protect the historic resources of the city
through establishing standards for the creation of local historic districts, for nominating
properties to the National Register of Historic Places, and for the issuance of certificates
of appropriateness for work undertaken in the locally adopted historic district(s).
Findings of fact:
a. There are located within the city districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas,
both public and private, which are reminders of past eras, events and persons important in
local, state or national history, or which provide significant examples of architectural
styles of the past, or which are unique and irreplaceable assets to the city and its
neighborhoods, or which provide for this and future generations examples of the physical
surroundings in which past generations lived.
b. In recognition of these assets, the historic preservation element of the comprehensive
plan was enacted and includes a policy to consider a historic preservation ordinance.
c. A study entitled "Historic Properties Survey of Lake Wales, Florida" was completed by
Historic Property Associates, Inc. of St. Augustine Florida in 1988 to catalogue
historical buildings in the downtown business district and in those areas that were closely
tied historically or stylistically with the downtown.
d. Through the dedicated efforts of local groups and individuals, the value of a district
and several sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas, both public and private, have
been recognized by their inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the state
inventory maintained by the division of archives.
e . The recognition, protection, enhancement and use of such resources has a public
purpose, being essential to the health, safety, morals and economic, educational, cultural
and general welfare of the public, since these efforts result in the enhancement of
property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of the city, the increase of
economic benefits to the city and its inhabitants, the promotion of local interest, the
enrichment of human life in its educational and cultural dimensions, serving spiritual as
well as material needs, and the fostering of civic pride in the beauty and noble
accomplishments of the past.
f. It is the policy of the city to encourage beautification and general improvement of and
cleanliness within the city by requiring the installation of appropriate landscaping which
will enhance the community's ecological, environmental and aesthetic qualities and
which will preserve the value of the property.
204/285

Article VII. Impacts Of Development On Public Facilities
Division 1. Concurrency
§ 23-701. Purpose and intent; definitions
Effective: Tuesday, January 19, 2016
207/285
(a) This division establishes a "concurrency management system" to evaluate development
applications to ensure that adequate capacity in required public facilities is or will be
available to serve the proposed development at the time it is required. In accordance with
F.S. § 163.180, public facilities subject to the concurrency management system are: sanitary
sewer, potable water, solid waste, roads, public schools, recreation and open space, and
drainage. The demand on a public facility is calculated through the use of the level of
service (LOS) standard for that facility or service adopted by the city in the Lake Wales
Comprehensive Plan and set forth in Table 23-705
(b) It is the intent of the city commission that no development permits or orders may be
issued that will cause a public facility or service to operate below the adopted level of
service standard. Development orders may, however, be conditioned such that public
facility improvements or capacity will be in place "concurrent" or at the time the facility or
service is needed by the proposed development. Consistent with Florida law, public
facilities to serve the new development shall be in place no later than the issuance by the
city of a certificate of occupancy (CO) or its functional equivalent.
(c) The concurrency management system is intended to serve the long term interests of the
citizens of Lake Wales by implementing a managed growth perspective that monitors the
capacity of important public facilities and services in order to prevent the degradation of
adopted levels of service. The system does not, however, serve as a guarantee to any person
or property owner that a particular level of service or amount of capacity currently exists or
will exist in the future on a particular public facility at any given point in time.
(d) The following definitions apply to concurrency management rules and regulations:
Building permit: For purposes of the concurrency management system, a permit may
authorize the construction of a new building, expansion of floor area, or an increase in the
number of dwelling units contained in an existing building, or a change in use.
Capacity: The availability of a public service or facility to accommodate users, expressed
in an appropriate unit of measure, such as gallons per day or average daily trips.
Capacity, available: Capacity that can be reserved or committed to future users for a
specific public facility.
Capacity, committed: The amount of capacity that has been committed to accommodate
existing developments, developments which have been issued a final development approval,
committed development, and vested developments.
Capacity, reserved: Capacity that has been removed from the available capacity pool and
allocated to a particular property for a set period of time.
Certificate of occupancy: A document issued by the building official allowing the
occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure or use has been constructed
or will be used in compliance with all the applicable municipal codes and ordinances.
Concurrency facilities: Public facilities and services for which a level of service must be
met concurrent with the impacts of development or an acceptable deadline as mandated in
the City of Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan pursuant to F.S. Ch. 163 , shall include:
Sanitary Sewer, Potable Water, solid Waste, Roads, Public Schools, Recreation & open
Space, and Drainage.
Concurrency management monitoring system: The data collection, processing and analysis
performed by city staff to determine available capacity for concurrency facilities. Data
utilized shall be the most current reliable information available to the city.
208/285
Concurrency management system (CMS): The procedure and process that the city uses to
ensure that no development order or building permit is issued by the city unless the
necessary concurrency facilities are available or are assured to be available consistent with
the city's comprehensive plan. The procedure and process is also intended to ensure that
sufficient capacity for concurrency facilities are available to meet and maintain adopted
levels of service. As part of the CMS, the city shall operate and maintain a concurrency
management monitoring system.
Concurrency review: An evaluation by the planning and development director and staff
based on adopted level of service standards to ensure that public facilities and services
needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such
development, as defined in this CMS. If such facilities are not available, the developer of a
proposed development shall bear the cost of providing public services and facilities at the
level of service defined by the comprehensive plan and concurrent with the impacts of a
proposed development.
Concurrency status report: A status report prepared by the city identifying available
concurrency facility capacity. The status report shall be produced, modified and adjusted
from time-to-time as a result of the reservation of capacity or other act that alters the
availability of concurrency facility capacity.
Design capacity: The potential or suitability for holding, storing or accommodating the
demands upon a concurrency facility.
Development agreement: An agreement between the city and another party associated with
the development of land or the provision of public infrastructure, which may include
development agreements defined pursuant to F.S. § 63.3220, or as may be associated with
development orders issued pursuant to F.S. § 380.01.
Level of service (LOS): An indicator of the operational efficiency of service provided by a
concurrency facility.
Level of service standard: The adopted volume of demand required for each concurrency
facility to achieve acceptable operational efficiency.
Vested: Development shall be deemed "vested" and not subject to requirements of
concurrency management if development circumstances meet criteria for common law or
statutory vesting, as defined below. All "non-vested" development or development orders
are subject to all requirements of this CMS.
Vested rights, common law: A right not created by statute or the provisions of the City of
Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan which would authorize the development of real property
or the continued development of real property notwithstanding the provisions of the city's
comprehensive plan. The city may find such vesting to exist whenever the applicant proves
by a preponderance of evidence that the real property owner, acting in good faith upon some
act or omission of the city has made a substantial change in the position or has incurred such
extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy
the right to develop or to continue the development of the real property. The assignment of
the particular zoning classification or the assignment of a particular land use designation to
parcel of real property does not guarantee or vest any specific development rights to any
person or entity as to said real property.

(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-05; Ord. No. 2008-05, § 1, 2-19-08; Ord. No. 2016-01, §
8, 01-19-16)
Vested rights, statutory: A statutory right to develop or to continue the development of real
property pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 163.3187(8) or its successor provisions. Such
vesting may be found to exist if a valid and unexpired final development approval was
issued by the city prior to the March 15, 2005, if construction has commenced on the subject
development and the development is in the process of being completed or further
development is continuing in good faith. Statutory vesting does not occur unless all material
requirements, conditions, limitations and regulations of the development approval have been
met and are being maintained.
§ 23-702. Components of concurrency management system
(a) The concurrency management system (CMS) has three (3) components:
1. Inventory of public facilities and capacities. City staff must maintain an inventory of
existing public facilities for which level of service (LOS) standards have been adopted
and for which concurrency is to be determined. The inventory includes: The existing
condition and total capacity for each facility, the reservations of capacity that have been
granted for proposed development and an estimate of when the capacity will be utilized
as development progresses, and the remaining available capacity in the facility.
2. Concurrency review of proposed developments. Each development application must
be reviewed to determine if adequate capacity is or will be available to serve the
proposed development.
3. Schedule of improvements to public facilities. A program must be conducted by the
city to implement improvements to public facilities to correct deficiencies or expand
capacity to adequately serve existing and new development. The program will include
capital projects in the city's capital facilities budget and improvements required of new
development.
( b ) The city manager will provide an annual concurrency status report to the city
commission. The initial report will be presented no later than the second regularly
scheduled meeting in June, and subsequent reports will be presented at the second meeting
in January. The report will include in the reserved and committed capacity inventory, as
applicable, all developments for which permits and approvals were issued prior to March
15, 2005, provided they meet the vesting requirements for reservations of capacity or
certificates of concurrency.
(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-2005)
§ 23-703. Inventory of public facilities and concurrency status report.
The annual concurrency status report to the city commission on the inventory of public
facilities must include:
(a) The status of the city's public facilities in relation to the adopted levels of service;
(b) A tally of capacity reservations and commitments granted during the year;
(c) An analysis of when reserved and committed capacity will be utilized as development
progresses;
(d) Available capacity in each facility; and
210/285
(e) An evaluation of improvements completed or planned to maintain adopted levels of
service.
(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-2005)
§ 23-704. Concurrency review.
Sec. 23-704.1 Applicability. A concurrency review to determine compliance with this
section is required for all development and land uses in the City of Lake Wales unless
specifically exempted herein. Verification of compliance with this section is required prior
to the issuance of a site development permit pursuant to section 23-217, a building permit,
or a certificate of use pursuant to section 23-213 and prior to approval of services for land
uses outside of the city limits. Developments with permits or approvals issued prior to
March 15, 2005 shall be vested for reservations of capacity or certificates of concurrency
as provided in subsection 23-704.4.c. and d.
Sec. 23-704.2 Burden of proof. The applicant shall bear the burden of showing
compliance with the adopted levels of service and meeting the concurrency test. The
administrative official will direct the applicant to the appropriate staff to assist in the
preparation of the necessary documentation and information.
Sec. 23-704.3 Exemptions.
a. De minimus development. Developments or activities listed below are considered de
minimus, having insignificant or no impact upon public facilities with adopted level of
service (LOS) standards, and are exempt from concurrency review.
1 . Construction of and addition to single-family and two-family dwellings on platted
lots;
2 . The addition of an accessory apartment or guest house to a residential or
nonresidential property;
3 . Construction of accessory structures on single-family and two-family properties if
permitted under section 23-521, including swimming pools, garages, pole barns,
satellite dishes, greenhouses, screen enclosures, and fences; and
4 . Construction of and modifications to nonresidential structures with less than one
thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet of floor area.
b . The following activities shall be exempt from the concurrency review if the
administrative official issues a finding that they will have no significant impact upon
public facilities with adopted level of service (LOS) standards:
1. Changes in existing use of property or existing structures when the new use does not
increase any impact on public facilities over the existing use. No change in use will be
considered exempt when the prior use has been discontinued for two (2) years or more,
in which case the use shall be considered a new use. For changes in the use of property
when the new use increases the impact on public facilities, the existing intensity shall
be exempt and any increase over the existing intensity shall not be exempt;
2. Replacement of an existing dwelling unit when no additional units are created;
3. Replacement of a building or structure with a new building or structure of the same
use when no additional impact on public facilities is created over the pre-existing
building or structure being replaced;
211/285
4. Any development orders determined by the administrative official to have no impact
public facilities.
c . Applicants for development permits who claim vesting of rights under this section
shall meet a three-part test established under Florida case law for determining vested
development rights. All three (3) of the following must be met in order to be vested for
development:
A. good faith reliance on an act or omission of the city;
B. substantial expenditures or obligations subsequent to reliance on an act or omission
of the city; and
C. highly inequitable to deny development (i.e., private hardship outweighs the public
hardship).
(Ord. No. 2007-14, § 2, 6-5-07)
Sec. 704.4 Concurrency review process.
a . Development impact data. The applicant for approval of a preliminary subdivision
plat pursuant to section 23-223, a preliminary planned development project plan
pursuant to section 23-224, a major or minor site plan pursuant to section 23-222, a site
development permit pursuant to section 23-217, a building permit for a new structure or
expansion of a structure, a change of use pursuant to section 23-212 or 23-213, or any
application for services shall submit required development impact data on the proposed
development at the time of application. Submission of development impact data is also
required for the establishment of new land uses or changes in land use (see section 23-
213) regardless of whether construction is proposed on the property. Development
impact data required:
1. Sanitary sewer. For residential developments, projected sanitary sewer flow of the
proposed development, based upon the projected number of residents and the LOS
Standard provided in section 23-706. For nonresidential development, projected
volume of sewer flow. Additional information on the characteristics of the proposed
sanitary sewer flow may also be required by the director of public works to assess
impacts to the wastewater treatment plant.
2. Potable water. For residential developments, projected potable water demand of the
proposed development, based upon the projected number of residents and the LOS
standard provided in section 23-706. For nonresidential developments, projected daily
water usage.
3 . Solid waste. Projected solid waste to be generated by the proposed development,
based upon the LOS standard established by Polk County for its landfill facilities. For
nonresidential developments, projected daily solid waste generation. A certificate of
solid waste concurrency from Polk County is required prior to the issuance of a site
development permit.
212/285
4 . Roads. Preliminary traffic generation information, including estimated number of
trips and estimated impact upon roadways adjacent to the proposed development or use
shall be provided with applications for preliminary subdivision plats, preliminary
planned development project plans, major and minor site plans and changes of use.
Local and minor collector roads shall be considered project-level facilities, to be
provided by the developer. A certificate of transportation concurrency or an exemption
from Polk County is required prior to the issuance of a site development permit or
certificate of use for any project or change of use impacting county or state roadways.
5 . Recreation and open space. (Residential developments only.) The number of
residents projected in residential subdivisions, planned development projects and
multi-family developments or buildings shall be submitted. Also required is a
calculation of the acreage of parks required to serve the projected population, based on
the LOS standards per one thousand (1,000) people: .25 acres of mini-parks, 1.5 acres
of neighborhood parks, two (2) acres of community parks, and 3.75 acres of total
parks. Mini-parks and neighborhood parks are considered project-level facilities, to be
provided by the developer. Plans submitted for a site development permit shall show
all open space and parks in the development as required by the city as a condition of
approval of a preliminary subdivision plat, preliminary planned development project
plan, or site plan for multi-family development.
6 . Drainage. Information as required for applications for preliminary subdivision
plats, preliminary planned development project plans, and site plans shall suffice for
review of drainage concurrency. Drainage is considered a project-level facility, to be
provided by the developer. A copy of the storm water management permit or exemption
letter from the Southwest Florida Water Management District is required prior to the
issuance of a site development permit (section 23-217).
7 . Public schools. School concurrency requirements shall apply to all developments
with residential units if a major or minor site plan, subdivision plat or planned
development project plan is required for the development under this chapter.
Preliminary projections of students to be generated by the development shall be
provided with an application for a preliminary subdivision plat, preliminary planned
development project plan, or major or minor site plan. A finding by the administrative
official that school concurrency requirements are satisfied is required prior to the
issuance of a site development permit, building permit, or certificate of use for any
project or change of use impacting public schools, unless specifically exempted under
this chapter.
b. Impact assessment. The administrative official shall review the impact data for the
proposed development in consultation with the director of public works, the
development review committee, and Polk County departments, as applicable. The
"inventory of public facilities and capacities" maintained by the city as required under
section 23-703 shall be the basis for determining available capacities. The administrative
official shall make a report on each application stating the findings of the concurrency
review, including information or findings provided by Polk County in regard to roadway
impacts, solid waste capacity, or other matters under the county's jurisdiction. The report
may include recommendations on addressing concurrency deficiencies, including
developer contributions. The report shall be used by the permitting authority, (the
administrative official, the building official, the director of public works, the planning
board, and/or the city commission, as applicable), in deciding upon the application.
213/285
c . Reservation of capacity. A reservation of capacity shall be granted with a site
development permit, a building permit, or certificate of use only upon a finding of
adequate capacity in all facilities requiring concurrency review and satisfaction of the
requirements of section 23-731, as applicable.
1. Building permit or certificate of use. A building permit or certificate of use shall be
granted only if capacity in all required facilities is found to be adequate for a proposed
new use or change of use requiring an increase in service capacity. For potable water
and wastewater, a reservation of capacity shall not be granted without payment of
applicable impact fees per Article VII, division 4. Such reservation shall expire with the
building permit if the project is not completed, and in cases where a building permit is
not required, it shall expire six (6) months from the date of its issuance if the use for
which the certificate was issued is not established.
2. Preliminary plans. A preliminary site plan, subdivision plat or planned development
project plan shall be approved only upon a finding that there will be sufficient capacity
available for the project at the time it is required or that measures to correct any
deficiency have been identified and agreed to by the city in writing. Capacity for a
development with an approved and unexpired preliminary plan or plat shall be used in
calculating available capacity during the review of other preliminary plans. However,
except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no reservation of capacity shall be granted
with approval of a preliminary plan or plat, and approval of preliminary plans does not
guarantee that capacity will be available at the site development permit stage of project
review.
3. Site development permit. A site development permit under section 23-217 shall be
issued only upon a finding of adequate capacity in required facilities and approval by
the city of a utility services agreement if required under section 23-731. If exempted
under that section, a project shall be granted a reservation of potable water and
wastewater treatment capacity only upon payment of applicable impact fees per article
VII, division 4.

(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-05; Ord. No. 2008-05, § 4, 2-19-08)
§ 23-706. Application of level of service standards.
The applicant shall provide the planning and development department with the information
required to apply the adopted level of service standard as cited below. The demand on
concurrency facilities generated by the applicant's development will be determined as cited
below. Population densities will be calculated at an average of 2.4 per residential unit for
all residential development.
215/285
1 . Sanitary sewer. The demand for sanitary sewer capacity will be determined by
multiplying the total number of persons served times the level of service standard (one
hundred (100) gallons per capita per day). For nonresidential development, capacity will
be determined by projected volume of daily sewer flow.
2 . Potable water. The demand for potable water capacity will be determined by
multiplying the total number of persons served times the level of service standard (one
hundred twenty-two (122) gallons per capita per day). For nonresidential development,
capacity will be determined by projected volume of daily water usage.
3 . Solid waste. The demand for solid waste collection and disposal capacity will be
determined by multiplying the total number of persons served by the level of service
standard established by Polk County for its landfill facilities. For nonresidential
developments, capacity will be determined by projected daily solid waste generation.
Certification from Polk County for solid waste concurrency constitutes such evidence.
4 . Roads. The applicant will provide evidence demonstrating that the proposed project
meets the LOS established in the Transportation Element of the City's Comprehensive
Plan. Certification from Polk County for roadway concurrency constitutes such
evidence.
5 . Drainage. The applicant will provide evidence demonstrating that the proposed
project meets the LOS established in the Drainage Element of the City's Comprehensive
Plan. Issuance of a permit or exemption from the Southwest Florida Water Management
District for drainage facilities shall constitute such evidence.
6. Recreation and open space. The demand for recreation and open space capacity will
be determined by multiplying the total number of persons served times the level of
service standard for Community Parks (two (2) acres per one thousand (1,000)
population).
7 . Public schools. The demand for public school capacity shall be based upon the
number of units proposed and the student generation ratios approved for use by the Polk
County School Board.
(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-05; Ord. No. 2008-05, § 5, 2-19-08)
§ 23-707. Determination of available capacity.
For purposes of the CMS, the available capacity of a facility will be determined by adding
the cumulative total supply for each public facility component as cited in Step 1 and
subtracting cumulative total demand for each component as cited in Step 2.
Step 1: Add the indicators of available facility capacity:
1. Capacity of existing facility. The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the
required level of service; and
2 . Capacity of committed potable water, sewer, solid waste and drainage. The total
capacity of committed new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the
date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development.
Step 2: Subtract the committed capacity:
1 . Existing demand based on existing development. The demand for services or
facilities created by existing development as provided by the city.
216/285
2 . Demand to be generated by vested development, valid capacity reservations, and
valid certificates of concurrency. The demand for the service or facility created by the
anticipated completion of other vested and/or approved developments.
(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-2005)
§ 23-708. Criteria for concurrency.
A certificate of concurrency will not be granted for a proposed development unless the city
finds that adequate capacity for concurrency facilities exists at or above the adopted level
of service in order to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development, or that
improvements necessary to bring concurrency facilities up to their adopted level of service
will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development.
a. Minimum criteria. The following minimum criteria must be used to determine if a
required public facility or service is available to support proposed development.
1. Sanitary sewer, potable water and drainage.
A. The necessary facilities are in place at the time a development permit is issued; or
B . A development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary
facilities will be in place when the impacts of the development occur; or
C. The necessary facilities are under construction at the time the permit is issued; or
D. The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development
agreement that includes the provisions of Rules 9J-5.005(2)(a)13. An enforceable
development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements
pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 or an agreement or development order issued pursuant
to F.S. ch. 380. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and
services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur.
2. Solid waste. The criteria of paragraph 1. shall apply, and, in addition, the applicant
must provide the city with a notarized letter from Polk County certifying that the
proposed development's solid waste generation can be accommodated at the county's
landfill. A certificate of occupancy will not be issued unless all facility improvements
necessary to accommodate the impacts of the development are in place.
3 . Roads. The criteria of paragraph 1. shall apply, and, in addition, for projects
impacting county and state roadways, the applicant must provide the city with a
certificate of transportation concurrency or an exemption from Polk County and a copy
of a proportionate fair-share agreement, if applicable. Transportation concurrency for
city roadways may be satisfied by a transportation proportionate fair-share agreement
executed pursuant to section 23-709
4. Parks and recreation. The criteria of paragraph 1. shall apply, or alternatively, the
following shall be met:
A. At the time the development permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services
are the subject of a binding executed contract that provides for the commencement of
the actual construction of the required facilities or the provision of services within
one (1) year of the issuance of the development permit; or
217/285
B. The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development
agreement that requires the commencement of actual construction of the facilities or
the provision of the services within one (1) year of the issuance of the applicable
development permit. An enforceable development agreement may include but is not
limited to development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220 or an agreement or
development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380.
5. Public schools. School concurrency decisions should support and not be in conflict
with growth management policies of the comprehensive plan and shall be based upon
the school board's concurrency review findings and recommendations and interlocal
agreement.
A. Concurrency approval shall be granted by the administrative official only where:
i. The school board's findings indicate adequate school facilities for each level of
school will be in place or under construction within three (3) years of the issuance
of the subdivision plat or site plan for each level of school.
i i . Adequate school facilities are available in the relevant school concurrency
service area (CSA) or adjacent CSA where impacts of development can be shifted
to that area; or
iii. The developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation
proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by the actual
development of the property subject to the final plat or site plan.
iv. The identified deficiency is mitigated by available capacity in a start-up charter
school.
B. In the event that there is not sufficient capacity in the affected concurrency service
area based on the adopted level of service standard to address the impacts of a
proposed development, and the availability standard for school concurrency cannot
be met, one (1) of the following shall apply:
i . The project shall provide capacity enhancement(s) sufficient to meet its impact
through mitigation approved by the school board and consistent with the city's
school facilities element of the comprehensive plan; or
ii. The project shall be delayed to a date when the level of service can be ensured
through capital enhancement(s) of planned capacity increases; or
iii. A condition of approval of the subdivision or site plan is imposed to phase the
project's impact on a schedule ensuring that capacity enhancement and level of
service can be ensured; or
iv. The project shall not be approved.
C. If the impact of the project will not occur until years two (2) or three (3) of the
school board's financially feasible five-year program of work, then any relevant
programmed improvements in those years shall be considered available capacity for
the project and factored into the level of service analysis. If the impact of the project
will not be felt until years four (4) or five (5) of the five-year program of work, then
any relevant programmed improvements shall not be considered available capacity
for the project unless funding of the improvement is ensured through school board
funding to accelerate the project, through proportionate share mitigation or some
other means.
b. Additional requirements.
218/285
1. Solid waste. Commercial and industrial developments that are potential hazardous
waste generators shall provide a description and estimate of tonnage of solid waste to
be generated for which the development will be responsible for coordinating with Polk
County for disposal of such waste. The applicant will provide the city with a notarized
letter from Polk County certifying that the proposed development's hazardous waste
generation can be accommodated at the county's landfill. A certificate of occupancy
will not be issued unless all improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of
the development are in place.
2. Recreation. Commercial and industrial developments are not assessed as having an
impact on recreational facilities. However, the city may require the provision of
recreational facilities as part of planned unit developments. Prior to the issuance of a
building permit, all facility improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of
the entire development must be approved and a schedule established for their
implementation such that all improvements will be completed prior to the issuance of
the last certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. No. 2005-27, § 1, 7-5-05; Ord. No. 2006-46, § 2, 12-5-06; Ord. No. 2008-05, § 6,
2-19-08)
§ 23-709. Transportation proportionate fair-share program.
A. Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the
impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative
efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the Proportionate Fair-Share
Program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16).
B. Findings.
1. The commission finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that
has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city proportionate fair-share
program:
a. Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities
can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors;
b. Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure
of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost
of the transportation facility;
c . Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and
promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing
the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion;
d . Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve
future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the City to expedite
transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for
transportation improvements in the Capital Improvements Element (CIE).
e. Is consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), and supports the Concurrency Management
System (CMS) in the City Comprehensive Plan. (Policies 2.01 and 2.02 under
Objective 2 of the CIE and Policy 1.01 and 1.02 under Objective 1 of the
Transportation Element.)
219/285
C. Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in
city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a
transportation facility in the city CMS, including transportation facilities maintained by
FDOT or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations,
pursuant to the requirements of subsection D. The proportionate fair-share program does
not apply to developments of regional impact (DRI's) using proportionate fair-share under
F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in
article VII, div. 1, subsection 704.4(a)4 LWC. The proportionate fair-share program does
not preclude applicants from funding transportation improvements pursuant to a
development agreement to meet concurrency requirements.
If the project traffic for a proposed development will impact or create a deficient roadway
segment or intersection that is maintained by another jurisdiction, then the permitting
jurisdiction will coordinate with the maintaining jurisdiction regarding the need or
applicability for proportionate fair-share mitigation of project traffic.
D. General requirements.
1. An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirement of the
city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following
requirements:
a. The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable
land development regulations.
b . The five-year schedule of capital improvements in the city CIE or the long-term
schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term CMS includes the
construction phase of a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will
satisfy the requirements of the city transportation CMS.
2. The city may choose to allow applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through
the proportionate fair-share program by adding an improvement (construction phase) to
the CIE or adopted long-term CMS that will satisfy the requirements of the city
transportation CMS. For the purposes of the proportionate fair-share program, no
capacity road project shall be added to the CIE unless any required alignment study or a
project development and environmental (PD&E) study has been completed with an
endorsed build alternative.
To implement this option, the city shall adopt, by resolution or ordinance, a
commitment to add the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements
in the CIE or long-term schedule of capital improvements for an adopted long-term
CMS no later that the next regularly schedules update. To qualify for consideration
under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the appropriate city
commission, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)
(b)1, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of
this ordinance. Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share
obligation must meet the design standards of the jurisdiction with maintenance
responsibility for the subject transportation facility.
220/285
E. Memorandum of understanding on proportionate fair-share program. The city shall
coordinate with the Florida Department of Transportation, Polk Transportation
Organization, Central Florida Regional Planning Council and other local governments to
implement the provisions of the proportionate fair-share program. Appropriate provisions
for intergovernmental coordination will be detailed in a memorandum of understanding on
the proportionate fair-share program (MOU), and city shall coordinate with the signatory
parties to ensure that mitigation to impacted facilities is based on comprehensive and
consistent transportation data.
F. Application process.
1 . Upon notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, the
applicant shall also be notified in writing of the opportunity to satisfy transportation
concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the requirements
in subsection D.
2 . Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a preapplication
meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, e.g., project status in CIE,
application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the
impacted facility is on the SIS, or any state transportation facility, then the FDOT will be
notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting.
3. Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application
fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and the following:
a. Name, address and phone number of owner(s), developer and agent;
b. Property location, including parcel identification numbers;
c. Legal description and survey of property;
d. Project description, including type, intensity and amount of development;
e. Phasing schedule, if applicable;
f. Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation;
g. Copy of the project's traffic study or traffic impact analysis; and
h. Location map depicting the site and affected road network.
4. The city shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and
complete within ten (10) business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient,
incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share
program as indicated in subsection D., then the applicant will be notified in writing of the
reasons for such deficiencies within ten (10) business days of submittal of application. If
the applicant does not remedy such deficiencies within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The commission
may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed sixty (60) days to cure
such deficiencies, provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and
has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure.
5. Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for
development impacts to facilities on the Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) require the
concurrence of the FDOT. The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between
the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement.
221/285
6. When an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, the applicant shall be
advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding
agreement will be prepared by the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review,
including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a
SIS facility, or any state transportation facility, no later than sixty (60) days from the date
at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer
that forty-five (45) working days prior to the commission meeting when the agreement
will be considered.
7. The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the commission meeting when
the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share
agreement will be effective until approved by the commission.
G. Determining proportionate fair-share obligation.
1 . Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without
limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and
construction and contribution of facilities as provided in F.S. § 163.3180(16)(c).
2. A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The
fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities
shall not differ based on the form of mitigation as provided in F.S. § 163.3180(16)(c)
(contributions of private funds, land or facility construction).
3. The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation
shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows:
The cumulative number of peak hour, peak direction trips from the complete buildout
of the proposed development, or buildout of the stage or phase being approved, that are
assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided by the change in the peak
hour maximum service volume (MSV) or the proportionate share program segment
resulting from construction of the proportionate share program improvement,
multiplied by the anticipated cost of the proportionate share project. In this context,
cumulative does not include project rips from previously approved stages or phases of
development.
This methodology is expressed by the following formula:
Proportionate Fair Share = s[[(Development Trips;sub\sub;) / (SV Increase;sub\sub;)]
× Cost;sub\sub;]
Where:
s = Sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fair-share mitigation for a
project;
Development Trips;sub\sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development
under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency
per the concurrency management system (CMS);
SV Increase;sub\sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement
to roadway segment "i";
Cost;sub\sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include
the cost of all project phases (preliminary engineering or alignment study, design,
rights-of-way acquisition and construction) in the years said phases will occur with all
associated costs.
222/285
4. The cost of the proportionate fair-share project shall be determined by the maintaining
jurisdiction.
5. The value of right-of-way dedications used for proportionate fair-share payment shall
be subject to the approval of the maintaining jurisdiction. No value shall be assigned to
right-of-way dedications required under ordinance or as a condition of development
approval.
H. Proportionate fair-share agreements.
1 . Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) and satisfying
other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive a city certificate of
concurrency approval for transportation. Should the applicant fail to apply for building
permits within the timeframe provided for in the city concurrency certificate, then the
project's concurrency vesting shall expire, and the applicant shall be required to reapply.
Once a proportionate fair share payment for a project is made and other impact fees for
the project are paid, no refunds shall be given. All payments, however, shall run with the
land.
2 . Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution for a project and other road
impact fees not subject to an impact fee credit shall be due and must be paid within sixty
(60) days of the effective date of the proportionate fair-share agreement. The effective
date shall be specified in the agreement and shall be the date the agreement is approved by
the commission.
3 . All developer improvements accepted as proportionate fair-share contributions must
be completed within three (3) years of the issuance of the first building permit for the
project which is the subject of the proportionate fair-share agreement and be
accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all
required improvements. It is the intent of this section that any required improvements be
completed within three (3) years of the issuance of the first building permit for the
project which is the subject of the proportionate fair-share agreement.
4 . Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a
proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to the effective date of the
proportionate fair-share agreement.
5 . Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a
development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to
the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation.
6 . Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share
agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and
any associated advertising costs to the city will be nonrefundable.
I. Appropriation of fair-share revenues.
223/285
1. Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for
funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the
terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the discretion of the local
government having jurisdiction over the relevant transportation facility subject to the
proportionate fair-share agreement, and with the concurrence of the local government
issuing the development order, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for
operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the
proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. These operational improvements shall be
consistent with, and sustainable through, the construction of the capacity project.
Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the fifty (50) percent local match
for funding under the FDOT TRIP.
2 . In the event a scheduled facility improvements is removed from the CIE, then the
revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another
improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of
development.

Division 2. Development Agreements
§ 23-731. Utility capacity queue agreement.
Sec. 23-731.1. Findings, purpose and intent. The city commission has determined that,
during times of increased demand for and rapid utilization of remaining water, wastewater,
and reclaimed water capacity, additional capacity should not be sold without ensuring that
the existing facilities are not oversold, leaving the city unable to meet the capacity demands
sold. The city commission is committed to developing new facilities, but is unable to do so
without firm commitments for the new capacity and orderly reservation of capacity for
developers. Given the uncertainty of developer commitments, the city commission finds
that capacity reservations must be irrevocable after the developer has contracted for
services, but will allow transfer of capacity without a profit. The city commission finds
that it is in the interests of city citizens and the developers interested in developing within
the city, to develop a "queue" for all new requests for additional treatment plant capacity.
Sec. 23-731.2. Capacity reservations determine queue.
a . All capacity reserved paid in advance; queue position established. All future
requests for contracts for water, wastewater, and reclaimed water service by developers
owning or controlling property within the city shall require the developer to make
deposit payment based on ten (10) percent of the present capacity fees for the capacity
necessary for that property, and be placed in the city's utility capacity queue, prior to any
reservation of capacity in existing or future utility facilities. Application for development
approval, including application for approval of a conceptual plan, preliminary site plan,
preliminary subdivision plat, or preliminary planned development project plan shall
constitute a request for contract for utility service.
224/285
1 . Upon application for development approval, the developer shall execute a shortform
agreement ("Utility Capacity Queue Agreement") for the sole purpose of placing
the developer in the capacity queue for any future capacity to be constructed or
otherwise made available at new or existing facilities, until such time as a utility
services agreement can be negotiated between the parties. No capacity shall be
promised to the developer under the capacity queue agreement in exchange for the
partial capacity fee payment, but only a position in the queue to facilitate future
agreements for reservation of capacity, as well as the planning, design, or construction
of new capacity, if necessary. Once the queue agreement is executed and the partial
capacity fee is delivered with the agreement to the city, the city shall clock in the
agreement and capacity fee to establish the developer's position in the queue. The city's
signature is not required for the queue position. The development shall remain in the
capacity queue until such time as the city executes a utility services agreement with the
developer to reserve the utility treatment plant capacity.
2 . The city shall establish a utility capacity queue based on date of approval for all
developments or development phases for which a preliminary site plan, preliminary
subdivision plat, or preliminary planned development plan was approved prior to May
1, 2007 but for which a site development permit has not been granted. The capacity
queued for the development shall be that which was approved with the development
with the preliminary plan or plat, and a deposit of capacity fees shall not be required.
b . Capacity queue position converted to reservation of capacity. Once the utility
facilities for which the developers are queued are identified or completed by the city, or
the city manager determines that the facilities shall be completed before the capacity is
needed by the developers, developers in the queue may be offered utility services
agreements for their capacity needs, depending on the availability of capacity.
c . Abandonment of capacity by failure to execute utility services agreement. In the
event that a developer chooses not to execute a utility services agreement or is unable to
resolve contractual issues with the city in the city's utility services agreement within
thirty (30) days of being provided a draft of said agreement, the developer shall have
abandoned its capacity reservation offer. The city manager may extend the termination
date hereunder for no more than one (1) additional fifteen-day period, without
commission approval, if the city manager, in his or her sole discretion, determines that
the developer is negotiating in good faith, but has still been reasonably unable to resolve
its issues with the draft utility services agreement. Those developments for which a
utility services agreement has not been executed within the required time period shall
remain in the queue with their positions based upon their queue agreement dates. Those
developments that do not have a queue agreement and are in the queue based upon a plan
approval (see section 23-731.2.a.2) shall be removed from the queue. Upon notification
by a developer to remove a development from the queue, the city shall refund the partial
utility capacity fees made with the queue agreement less any city costs.
d. Capacity queue position may be transferred, but not for a profit. The developer's
position in a capacity queue can be transferred only as part of a sale of the land for which
the capacity is sought; however, such capacity cannot be sold or transferred for more than
the amount paid by the developer.
e. Ties for capacity queue take same place. In the event that more than one developer
executed and paid for their requested capacity within twenty-four (24) hours of another
developer, the queue position shall be deemed a "tie," and both (or all) shall be given the
same place in the queue. Bond placement shall not be considered for the tie.
225/285
f . Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the requirement that all developments
requesting new capacity shall first enter into a queue agreement:
1. Units constructed on lots platted or otherwise legally in existence prior to the date of
passage of this Ordinance.
2 . Non-residential developments to be served by capacity set aside for economic
development.
(Ord. No. 2008-13, § 1, 5-6-08)
Sec. 23-731.3. Existing agreements for capacity reservation not in queue. This
Ordinance is not intended to modify any existing agreements committing the city to
provide capacity at the present utility facilities, except for the addition of Minimum
Revenue Fees for Capacity.
Sec. 23-731.4. Form of utility capacity queue agreement.
NOTE: THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO
TIME BY RESOLUTION.
UTILITY CAPACITY QUEUE AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into this day of

Division 3. Development Exactions And Dedications
§ 23-751. Dedication of sites for recreational uses or fee in lieu.
a. Where an evaluation under the concurrency management system (See article VII, div. 1)
indicates that additional usable recreation land and facilities are needed to maintain the
adopted level of service standard, the developer shall dedicate land of suitable size,
topography and general character to the city or pay a fee that is equal to the fair market
value of the land otherwise required to be dedicated. The required acreage or fee shall be
determined by the administrative official based on the development impact data submitted
in connection with the proposed development.
b . Where dedication of recreation land is not required to maintain the adopted level of
service, the city may refuse to accept such land, or establish reasonable conditions for
acceptance. Proposed recreational uses must be consistent with the Future Land Use Map
of the Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan. Other conditions may include, but are not limited
to, the following:
1. Land must be readily accessible and usable for recreational purposes.
2. Land must be fully or partially developed for recreational use at time of acceptance.
3. The facility would meet a specific recreational need of the city (i.e., picnic areas, boat
launch facilities).
§ 23-752. Dedication of right-of-way.
Right-of-way required to serve all development shall be dedicated to the City of Lake
Wales in accordance with the requirements of section 23-303. Where subdivisions are
bordered by public right-of-way, additional right-of-way shall be dedicated so as to meet
minimum widths specified in the comprehensive plan. Where dedicated right-of-way is
extended to an adjoining property or street, there shall be no reserved strips affording
private control of future access. The city may require public reserved strips where such
reservations promote the public health and safety and implement the comprehensive plan.
Where right-of-way has been dedicated independent of any requirement of these land
development regulations or the Comprehensive Plan, the city may refuse to accept such
right-of-way, or establish such conditions for acceptance as the city commission
determines to be reasonable.
§ 23-753. Dedication of utility easements.
Easements for public utilities shall be dedicated to the city as required in conjunction with
approvals subdivision plats, planned development projects, site plans, and site development
permits.
§ 23-754. Conveyance of land, streets or facilities to an owners
association.
227/285
Where common land, private streets or facilities are not to be dedicated to the city but are
to be conveyed to an owners association, the following standards shall apply:
a. The organization or legal entity established for the purpose of owning and maintaining
common land, private streets or facilities shall be created by covenants running with the
land. The documents creating such an association shall be reviewed and approved by the
city attorney prior to issuance of the final development order.
b . No such organization shall be dissolved nor shall it dispose of any common land,
private streets or facilities by sale or otherwise except to an organization conceived and
organized to own and maintain such property. The organization may offer to dedicate all
such land, streets and facilities to the city. The city may make acceptance subject to
improvements which shall be made before the land, streets or facilities are transferred. If
the city agrees to accept the land, streets or facilities, the organization may be disbanded,
but not before the improvements are made and the property is transferred.
Division 4. Public Facilities Impact Fees
§ 23-761. Definitions.
When used in this division, the following words, terms or phrases shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
Affordable housing shall mean a dwelling unit which is offered for sale or rent to lowincome
persons or very low-income persons and which monthly rent or monthly
mortgage payments, including taxes and insurance, do not exceed thirty (30) percent of
that amount which represents the percentage of the median adjusted gross income for
low-income persons and very low-income persons.
Alternative impact fee shall mean any alternative fee calculated by an applicant and
approved by the city manager or city commission pursuant to section 23-765.
Encumbered shall mean monies committed by contract or purchase order in a manner
that obligates the city to expend the encumbered amount upon delivery or completion of
goods, services or real property provided by a vendor, supplier, contractor or owner.
Impact fee shall mean, collectively, the fees imposed pursuant to this division.
Impact fee study shall mean the study adopted pursuant to section 23-763, as amended
and supplemented pursuant to section 23-779.
Infill lot shall mean any single vacant lot located in a predominately built-up area served
by city utilities, which is bounded on two (2) or more sides by existing development. In
addition, any lot that contains an existing building which will be removed and replaced
with a new building shall also be considered an infill lot.
Mixed use construction shall mean construction in which more than one (1) impact fee
land use category is contemplated, with each category consisting of a separate and
identifiable enterprise not subordinate to or dependent on other enterprises within the
construction.
Owner shall mean the person holding legal title to the real property upon which public
facilities impact construction is to occur.
Person shall mean an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an incorporated
association, or any other similar entity.
228/285
Public facilities shall mean those facilities identified in this division for which impact
fees are imposed.
Public facilities impact construction shall mean land development which changes the
use of land in a manner which increases the impact upon the public facilities for which
impact fees are imposed under this division.
Residential shall mean apartments, condominiums, mobile homes or single-family
detached houses.
Site-related improvement shall mean any improvement constructed on the development
site which is required to connect a building or structure with a city capital facility.
(Ord. No. 2008-08, § 1, 3-4-08)
§ 23-762. Legislative findings and intent.
a. Both existing development and development resulting from growth, as contemplated by
the comprehensive plan, will require improvements, and additions to public facilities to
accommodate and maintain the level of service adopted by the city.
b. Future growth represented by public facilities impact construction should contribute its
fair share to the cost of improvements and additions to public facilities that are required to
accommodate the use of such facilities by growth.
c. The required improvements and additions to the public facilities needed to accommodate
existing development at the adopted level of service shall be financed by revenue sources
other than impact fees.
d . Implementation of an impact fee structure to require future public facilities impact
construction to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to
public facilities is an integral and vital element of the management of growth.
e. Public facilities planning is an evolving process and the level of service adopted by the
city for such public facilities constitutes a balancing of anticipated need and the
corresponding cost to implement such standard, based upon present knowledge and
judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns, the needs of the
community and the dynamics of public facilities planning, it is the intent of the
commission that the level of service and the cost of the various public facilities be
reviewed and adjusted periodically, pursuant to section 23-779, to insure that the impact
fees imposed pursuant to this division are equitable and lawful based on the impact of
growth upon these public facilities.
f. This ordinance shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from public
facilities impact construction in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the
need for and demand on those public facilities generated by such impact construction.
g. This division is intended to be consistent with the principles for allocating a fair share of
the cost of new public facilities to new users as established by the Florida Supreme Court
in the case of Contractor and Builders Association of Pinellas County vs. City of Dunedin,
329 So. 2nd 314 (FL 1976) and to meet the requirements of the "Florida Impact Fee Act,"
F.S. ch. 163.31801, particularly the requirement that impact fees are to be based on "the
most recent and localized data."

229/285
§ 23-763. Adoption of impact fee study and impact fee schedule.
The commission hereby adopts and incorporates by reference the study entitled
"Development Impact FeesCity of Lake Wales, Florida" prepared by Clarion Associates
and dated December 26, 2011 particularly the assumptions, conclusions and findings in
such study as to the allocation of anticipated costs of capital improvements and additions
to the capital facilities between those costs required to accommodate existing development
and those costs required by growth. The impact fee schedule shall be as set forth in said
study on "Figure 2AProposed Impact Fees in North and South Service Areas."
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-21-2006; Ord. No. 2012-03, § 2, 2-7-12)
§ 23-764. Payment of impact fees.
a. Except as otherwise provided in this article, prior to the issuance of a building permit for
a public facilities impact construction, an applicant shall pay the appropriate impact fees as
established by this division.
b. The obligation for payment of the impact fees shall run with the land.
c . In the event that a building permit issued for a public facilities impact construction
expires prior to completion of the public facilities impact construction for which it was
issued, the applicant may within ninety (90) days of the expiration of the building permit
apply for a refund of the impact fees. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the impact fees
shall waive any right to a refund.
1 . The application for a refund shall be filed with the administrative official and shall
contain the following:
A. The name and address of the applicant;
B. The location of the property which was the subject of the building permit;
C. The date the impact fee was paid;
D. A copy of the receipt of payment for the impact fees; and
E. The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration.
2 . After verifying that the building permit has expired and the public facilities impact
construction has not been completed, the administrative official shall refund the impact
fees paid for such public facilities impact construction.
3 . A building permit which is subsequently issued for a public facilities impact
construction on the same property which was the subject of a refund shall pay all impact
fees as established by this division.
d . In the event that the city issues separate building permits for a building or part of a
building within a public facilities impact construction which by design contemplates
phased occupancy, the city and the applicant may enter into an agreement for the phased
payment of the impact fees applicable to that portion of the public facilities impact
construction represented by such building, provided, however, that all impact fees due shall
be paid prior to the issuance of the final building permit for the building.
e. The payment of all impact fees shall be in addition to other fees, charges or assessments
imposed by the city for the issuance of a building permit.
230/285
f . Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant of a public facilities impact
construction may enter into a fee agreement with the city providing for the payment of the
impact fees at a time other than as provided in this division. Such an agreement shall
require the applicant to post an irrevocable letter of credit payable by a financial
institution, acceptable to the city, to ensure payment of the fees at a time other than prior to
issuance of the building permit.
1. The irrevocable letter of credit shall contain no conditions upon the obligation of the
issuer for the payment of the principal amount and any interest due thereon.
2. Except as otherwise approved by the city commission, no deferral of the payment of
impact fees shall extend for a period greater than one (1) year from the date of the
building permit, provided that the city manager may approve an additional period of six
(6) months upon good cause shown, and subject to the submission of a new application.
Any requests for a six-month extension must be made in writing at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration date of the irrevocable letter of credit.
3. Notwithstanding that the applicant may obtain a deferral to a date certain, all impact
fees shall be paid at either the date to which the payment has been deferred or the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the public facilities impact construction,
whichever occurs first except as otherwise approved by the city commission.
(Ord. No. 2007-14, § 4, 6-5-07)
§ 23-765. Alternative impact fee calculation.
a. In the event an applicant believes that the impact to the public facilities necessitated by a
public facilities impact construction is less than the fees established by this division, such
applicant may, prior to issuance of a building permit for such public facilities impact
construction, submit a calculation of an alternative impact fee to the city manager pursuant
to the provisions of this section. The city manager shall review the calculations and make a
determination within ten (10) business days of submittal as to whether such calculation
complies with the requirements of this section.
b . The alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or
assumptions contained in this division, the impact fee study or independent sources,
provided that:
1 . The independent source is a generally accepted standard source of planning
information and cost impact analysis performed pursuant to a generally accepted
methodology of planning and cost impact analysis which is consistent with the impact fee
study;
2 . The independent source is a local study supported by a data base adequate for the
conclusions contained in such study performed pursuant to a generally accepted
methodology of planning and cost impact analysis which is consistent with the impact fee
study; or
3. The independent source is based upon recent available data from the Trip Generation
Report by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) for the land use category in
question.
231/285
c. If a previously approved public facilities impact construction project submitted, during
its approval process, an alternative impact fee study substantially consistent with the
criteria required by this section, and if such study is determined by the city manager to be
current, the impact upon the public facilities as determined by such previously approved
public facilities impact construction shall be presumed to be as described in the prior
study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative impact fee study
conducted more than two (2) years earlier is invalid.
d. If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the
applicant to calculate the alternative impact fees comply with the requirements of this
section, the alternative impact fees shall be paid in lieu of the fees established by this
division.
e. If the city manager determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the
applicant to calculate the alternative impact fees do not comply with the requirements of
this section, then the city shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt
requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative impact fees and the reason
therefor. The applicant shall have fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the written
notification of rejection to request a hearing pursuant to section 23-772
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-21-2006)
§ 23-766. Alternative collection of fees.
In the event that impact fees are not paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the
affected public facilities impact construction, the city shall proceed to collect the impact
fees as follows:
a. The city shall serve, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice of impact fees
upon the applicant at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the
property appraiser of the county. Service of the notice of impact fees shall be deemed
notice of the impact fees due and service shall be deemed effective on the date the return
receipt indicates the notice was received by either the applicant or the owner or the agent
of either by execution of the return receipt, whichever occurs first. The notice of impact
fees shall contain the legal description of the property upon which the public facilities
impact construction occurred and shall advise the applicant and the owner as follows:
1. The amount due and the general purpose for which impact fees were imposed;
2 . That a hearing pursuant to section 23-772 may be requested within fifteen (15)
calendar days from the date of receipt of the notice of impact fees, by making
application to the city manager;
3. That the impact fees shall be deemed delinquent if not paid and received by the city
within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the notice of impact fees is received,
excluding the date of receipt, or if hearing is not requested pursuant to section 23-772,
and, upon becoming delinquent, shall be subject to the imposition of a delinquent fee
and interest on the unpaid amount until paid; and
4. That in the event the impact fees become delinquent, a lien against the property for
which the building permit was secured shall be recorded in the official records of the
county.
232/285
b. The impact fees shall be delinquent if, within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of
receipt of the notice of impact fees by either applicant or owner, neither the impact fees
have been paid and received by the city, nor a hearing requested pursuant to section 23-
772. In the event a hearing is requested pursuant to section 23-772, the impact fees shall
become delinquent if not paid within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the
commission determines the amount of impact fees due upon the conclusion of such
hearing. Said time periods shall be calculated on a calendar day basis, including
Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays, but excluding the date of the earliest receipt of
said impact fee statement or the date of the commission's decision, in the event of an
appeal. In the event the thirtieth day prior to becoming delinquent falls on a Saturday,
Sunday or legal holiday, then the impact fees shall become delinquent at 5:00 p.m. of the
next business day. Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten (10)
percent of the total impact fees imposed shall be assessed. Such total impact fees, plus
delinquency fee, shall bear interest at the statutory rate for final judgments calculated on
a calendar day basis, until paid.
c. Should the impact fees become delinquent as set forth in paragraph b., the city shall
serve, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice of lien upon the delinquent
applicant and upon the delinquent owner at the address appearing on the most recent
records maintained by the property appraiser of the county. The notice of lien shall notify
the delinquent applicant and the delinquent owner that due to their failure to pay the
impact fees, the city shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court.
d. Upon the mailing of the notice of lien, the city clerk shall file a claim of lien with the
clerk of the circuit court for recording in the official records of the county. The claim of
lien shall contain the legal description of the property upon which the public facilities
impact construction occurred, the amount of the delinquent impact fee and the date of its
imposition. Once recorded, the claim of lien shall constitute a lien against the property
described therein.
e. After the expiration of one (1) year from the date of recording of the claim of lien, as
provided herein, a suit may be filed to foreclose said lien. Such foreclosure proceedings
shall be instituted, conducted and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the
foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. ch. 173, and any
amendments thereto, which provisions are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety to
the same extent as if such provisions were set forth herein verbatim.
f. The liens for delinquent impact fees imposed hereunder shall remain liens coequal with
the liens of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, superior in dignity to all other
filed liens and claims, until paid as provided herein.
g. The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in this section shall be cumulative
with, supplemental to, and in addition to all other applicable procedures provided in any
other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city or any applicable law or
administrative regulation of the State of Florida, and any amendments thereto. Failure of
the city to follow the procedure set forth in this section shall not constitute a waiver of
its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city
or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of Florida.
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-21-2006)

facilities impact construction with square footage equal to the existing square footage,
plus the contemplated increased square footage. However, the impact fee shall be
calculated only upon the increased square footage.
(Ord. No. 2006-04, § 1, 2-21-06)
§ 23-769. Vested rights.

manager shall issue an impact fee exemption. The impact fee exemption shall be presented
in lieu of payment of the public facilities impact fees.
d. For a residential unit to receive an affordable housing exemption, the monthly rent or
mortgage payment, including taxes and insurance, shall not exceed thirty (30) percent of
the monthly income of a low-income household in Lake Wales, and such restriction must
continue for a period of at least seven (7) years from the issuance of the building permit.
For properties proposed for sale, such restriction shall be contained either within the deed
for the property, within the terms, restrictions and conditions of the direct government
grant or subsidy, or within the terms of a development agreement entered into pursuant to
the Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act. For units proposed for rental,
such restriction shall be contained in any lease or rental agreement between the owner and
renter, and a notarized affidavit by the owner attesting that the rental fee meets the current
restricted amount and that a copy of the affidavit has been given to the renter(s) shall be

in section 23-762, the commission hereby specifically ascertains, determines and declares
as follows:
1. The water systems are designed and intended to provide water services for all persons
within the city's utility service area and are exclusively provided by the city; therefore, the
water system impact fee shall be imposed throughout the Lake Wales Utility Service
Area as that area is defined by interlocal agreement between the city and the county and
the tri-city agreement between the city and the cities of Winter Haven and Dundee, as
they may be amended from time to time. Said agreements are on file in the official

impact fee provide a benefit to all water system impact construction in excess of the
impact fee.
3. The existing water system and other improvements and additions contemplated by the
commission and funded by revenues other than impact fees, shall eliminate any
deficiency between the existing water system and the adopted level of service and shall be
sufficient for the needs of the existing population of the utility service area. Therefore,
the revenues derived from the water system impact fee shall be utilized only for the
improvements and additions to the water system which are necessitated by water system
impact construction.
b. Imposition of water system impact fees. All water system impact construction occurring
within the city, shall pay the impact fees as established within Schedule "B", which is
attached hereto and incorporated by reference.
240/285

the "Water System Impact Fee Trust Account," which shall be maintained separate and
apart from all other accounts of the city. All such impact fees shall be deposited into such
trust fund immediately upon receipt.
d. Use of water system impact fees. The monies deposited into the Water System Impact

§ 23-775. Wastewater system impact fees.
a . Findings applicable to wastewater system impact fees. In addition to the findings
contained in section 23-762, the commission hereby specifically ascertains, determines and
declares as follows:
241/285
1. The wastewater systems are designed and intended to provide wastewater services for
all persons within the city's utility service area and are exclusively provided by the city;
therefore, the wastewater system impact fee shall be imposed throughout the Lake Wales
Utility Service Area as that area is defined by interlocal agreement between the city and
the county and the tri-city agreement between the city and the cities of Winter Haven and
Dundee, as they may be amended from time to time. Said agreements are on file in the
official records of the city and are incorporated herein by reference.
2. The improvements and additions to the wastewater system funded by the wastewater
system impact fee provide a benefit to all wastewater system impact construction in
excess of the impact fee.
3 . The existing wastewater system and other improvements and additions contemplated
by the commission and funded by revenues other than impact fees, shall eliminate any
deficiency between the existing wastewater system and the adopted level of service and

Lake Wales classes of streets:
Arterial means a highway or street which provides a direct, relatively high-speed route
for large volumes of traffic for long, local trips and provides access to major regional
highways. The Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan defines an arterial as "A route that is
relatively continuous, of high traffic volume, of long average trip length, of high
operating speed, and of high mobility importance. A part of a rural network of
continuous routes serving substantial statewide travel by connecting urbanized areas of
linking counties and towns providing intrastate and intracounty service."
Collector means a street which conducts moderate volumes of traffic between local
streets and arterials and also provides access to abutting properties.
Major collectors provide connections between minor collectors or local streets and
arterials. The Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan defines an arterial as "A route that is
relatively continuous, of high traffic volume, of long average trip length, of high
operating speed, and of high mobility importance. A part of a rural network of
continuous routes serving substantial statewide travel by connecting urbanized areas of
linking counties and towns providing intrastate and intracounty service."
267/285
Minor collectors provide connections between local streets and major collectors or
arterials. The Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan defines a minor collector as "A route
that collects traffic from local roads and brings all developed areas within a reasonable
distance of a major collector road."
Local streets provide connections between individual properties and collectors or
arterials. The Lake Wales Comprehensive Plan defines a local street as "A route that
has the function of providing accessibility to individual parcels of property in
residential areas. Local streets carry light volumes of traffic and should be designed to
discourage through traffic and encourage low vehicular speeds."
Street, private means a road not dedicated for public use; a private street may be owned
by a developer, homeowners' association, or other non-governmental entity.
Street, public means a road dedicated to a governmental entity (e.g. state, city) for use

Accessory structure means a building or appurtenance incidental and subordinate to the
principal buildings and located on the same lot as the principal building or on an

building, it shall be considered a part thereof, and not an accessory building. Examples
of accessory structures are: detached garages, storage sheds, swimming pools.

unimproved, into three (3) or more contiguous lots or parcels of land for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership if the establishment of a new
street is necessary to provide access to the lots, parcels or tract of land; provided,
however, that the division of land into lots or parcels of five (5) acres or more and which
does not involve any change in street lines or public easements of any kind, shall not be
deemed a subdivision within the meaning of this ordinance. Subdivision does include
resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context of this ordinance, relates to the
process of subdividing or to the land subdivided or proposed to be subdivided.
Resubdivision. A change in a map of an approved or recorded subdivision plat if such

the terms replat, or revised plat. In whatever tense used: To plat shall mean to divide or
subdivide land into lots, blocks, tracts, sites, streets, rights-of-way, easements, or other
divisions, however designated.
Subordinate. The term "subordinate" is used in reference to accessory uses and
structures to mean smaller in size, importance, and scope. Generally, unless otherwise
limited in this ordinance, "subordinate" shall mean less than twenty-five (25) percent of
the size, importance, or scope of the principal use and less than fifty (50) percent of the
size of the principal structure on the premises.
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed
fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. The
administrative official may require verification of the market value in making a
determination of substantial improvement or substantial damage.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, taking place within a calendar year, the cumulative cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the "market value" of the structure before
the "start of construction" of the improvement or, in the case of repairs, before the
damage occurred. The administrative official may require verification of the "market
value" in making a determination of "substantial improvement" or "substantial damage."
The term "substantial improvement" also includes structures that have incurred
"substantial damage" or "repetitive loss" regardless of the actual repair work performed.
This term does not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for, permit for
improvement and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
