PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Gilbert, Arizona. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through July 6, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the common council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the town staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

(3)  A judge or hearing officer may waive all or part of the default fee if the payment of the fee would cause a financial hardship to the defendant. 
(4)  If the court refers any delinquent fines, fees, sanctions, penalties or restitution for collection, any collection or attorney costs are recoverable from the defendant and may be added to any balance due from the defendant to the court. 
(g)  The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise.

(4)  The court shall conduct the post-seizure hearing within 15 days of the court's receipt of the request, excluding weekends and town holidays. 
(5)  Failure of the owner or keeper, or the owner's or keeper's agent, to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall result in a forfeiture of any right to a post-seizure hearing and the animal shall be abandoned and will be either placed up for adoption through Maricopa County Animal Care and Control, an animal welfare organization, an animal shelter, a suitable home or humanely destroyed according to law. 
a.  In the event of the acquittal or final discharge without a conviction of a person who was charged under this article, or a determination that the animal is not vicious, the court shall, upon demand, direct the release of seized or impounded animals that have not been forfeited upon a showing of proof of ownership. Any questions regarding ownership shall be determined in a separate hearing by the court and the court shall hear testimony from any persons who may assist in determining ownership of the animal. If the owner is determined to be unknown or the owner is prohibited or unable to retain possession of the animal for any reason, the court shall order the animal released for placement with Maricopa County Animal Care and Control, an animal welfare organization, an animal shelter, a suitable home or humanely euthanized according to law. This subsection shall not be construed to cause the release of an animal seized or impounded pursuant to any other local, state or federal law or regulation.

Upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in the rights-of-way or utility easement of the town, the permittee shall provide to town the installation records in a format compatible with the current town mapping format showing the locations of all underground and above ground facilities. In the event permittee fails to provide the records as required herein, the town shall have the right to recover all costs incurred by the town in creating or obtaining said records. If facilities are not located in the precise location depicted in the records and the permittee fails to correct said deficiency in records within 30 calendar days to the satisfaction of the town, permittee shall reimburse the town for all costs and damages the town incurs associated with locating said facilities (and, if deemed necessary by the town, to relocate), including all delay costs. In the event the town determines that facilities need to be relocated as provided herein, the permittee shall also reimburse the town for the costs associated with locating and potholing permittee's facilities. 
(4)  Removal and restoration obligations. Whenever the permittee shall cause any opening or alteration whatever to be made for any purpose in any rights-of-way or utility easement of the town, the work shall be completed within a reasonable time, and the permittee shall, without expense to the town and upon completion of such work, restore the property disturbed in a manner consistent with the town's duly adopted standards, and as required by its permit, license, or franchise which may incorporate special standards when required for town purposes. Landscaping, whether in the right-of-way or on private property, which is damaged by a permittee shall be restored to its condition as it existed prior to the work. A permittee shall exercise special care when working near established trees or shrubs. If established trees or shrubs die within six months of completion of work by a permittee, it is presumed that the permittee caused such damage if the work performed was in the location of the roots of such tree or shrub. 
(5)  Town's facilities. The installation, use, and maintenance of the permittee's facilities within the rights-of-way or utility easement of the town authorized herein shall be in such a manner as not to interfere with the town's placement, construction, use, and maintenance of its rights-of-way, street lighting, water pipes, drains, sewers, traffic signal systems, or other town systems that have been, or may be, installed, maintained, used or authorized by the town. 
(6)  Interference. The permittee shall not install, maintain, or use any of its facilities in such a manner as to damage or interfere with facilities of another located within the rights-of-way or utility easement of the town. 
(7)  Location and maintenance. The location of above-ground facilities, such as boxes, cabinets and similar equipment or appurtenances, shall be approved by the town engineer. The permit shall set forth the location of such above-ground facilities. If the town engineer determines that a proposed location would impair traffic visibility or visibility of existing signage or would substantially harm existing landscaping, or that similar conditions exist which would justify a denial of a permit in that location, the permit shall be denied. All facilities shall be maintained in good condition. If the town finds any of permittee's facilities are not maintained in good condition, including any pedestals or cabinets in their appropriate or upright position, permittee shall correct such condition within three business days of receiving notice from town. 
(8)  Plans. Unless waived by the town engineer pursuant to subsection 10-5(a)(3), all facilities shall be installed per plans prepared by a registered professional engineer. All plans shall be approved by the town before the work commences. A permittee may install facilities on existing utility poles or in existing conduit where permission is granted by owner of the utility pole or conduit, and such permission is verified by the town except where those same poles are scheduled to be replaced with buried facilities. The town may require the permittee to prove that it has such permission from the owner to use the owner's facilities. To the extent permitted by law, no new poles, or longer poles, will be permitted in the rights-of-way or utility easement of the town for any new facilities. If permittee installs facilities on existing poles as provided herein, the permittee shall bury its facilities if such poles are removed and not replaced in kind for any reason. If the permittee makes use of existing conduit of another person, the permittee shall be subject to the provisions of this section in the use of such conduit in the rights-of-way. As used herein, a pole installed to replace a damaged pole and which is the same weight and size of the pole being replaced shall not be considered to be a new pole. 
(9)  Insurance; bonding. Each permittee must obtain and maintain such insurance, bonding, and security fund requirements as specified by the town, or if no specific requirements are specified, as are required by the town for similar facilities. No work shall commence unless these requirements have been satisfied, and the town may require the permittee to remove or stop work on facilities or require a permittee to cease using the facility, when any insurance, bonding, and security fund requirements are not satisfied. 
(10)  Repairs. A permit shall be obtained from the town prior to a person removing, abandoning, relocating, or reconstructing, if necessary, any portion of a person's facilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town understands and acknowledges there may be instances when a person is required to make repairs, in compliance with federal or state laws, that are of an emergency nature. The permittee will notify the town prior to such repairs, if practicable, and will obtain the necessary permits in a reasonable time after notification. 
(11)  Conflict with town projects and public improvements. 
a.  Identification of conflict. If, during the design process for public improvements, the town discovers a potential conflict with proposed construction, the permittee shall either: 
1.  Locate and, if necessary, expose its facilities in conflict; or 
2.  Use a location service under contract with the town to locate or expose its facilities. The permittee shall reimburse the town for the cost resulting from the use of such location service. The town shall make reasonable efforts to design and construct projects pursuant to this section so as to avoid relocation expense to the permittee. Permittee shall furnish the location information in a timely manner, but in no case longer than ten calendar days from the town's request. 
b.  Priority right. The town reserves the prior and superior right to lay, construct, erect, install, use, operate, repair, replace, remove, relocate, regrade, widen, realign, or maintain rights-of-way, aerial, surface, or subsurface improvements, including, but not limited to, water mains, traffic control conduits, cable and devices, sanitary or storm sewers, subways, tunnels, bridges, viaducts, or any other public construction within the rights-of-way and utility easements of the town. 
c.  Relocation. When the town invokes its prior superior right to the rights-of-way, the permittee shall move its facilities located in the rights-of-way and utility easements of the town, at its own cost, to such a location as the town directs. 
d.  Procedures. If, during the course of a project, the town determines permittee's facilities are in conflict, the following shall apply: 
1.  Prior to the town notice to proceed to contractor: The permittee shall, within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding one month, remove or relocate the conflicting facility. This time period shall begin running upon receipt by the permittee of written notice from the town. However, if both the town and the permittee agree, the time frame may be extended based on the requirements of the project. 
2.  Subsequent to town notice to proceed to contractor: The town and the permittee will immediately begin the coordination necessary to remove or relocate the facility. Actual construction of such removal or relocation is to begin no later than 72 hours, if practicable, after written notification from the town of the conflict. 
(12)  Damage to town rights-of-way and facilities. 
a.  If, in the installation, use, or maintenance of its facilities, the permittee damages or disturbs the surface of subsurface of any rights-of-way or adjoining public property, or the public improvement located thereon, therein, or thereunder, the permittee shall promptly, at its own expense, and in a manner acceptable to the town, restore the surface or subsurface of the rights-of-way or public property, or repair or replace the public improvement thereon, therein, or thereunder, in as good a condition as before such damage or disturbance. If such restoration, repair or replacement of the surface, subsurface, or any structure located thereon, therein, or thereunder is not completed within a reasonable time, or such repair or replacement does not meet town standards, the town shall have the right to perform the necessary restoration, repair, or replacement, either through its own forces, or through a hired contractor, and the occupant agrees to reimburse the town for its expense in so doing within 30 calendar days after receipt of the invoice therefor. 
b.  The permittee shall reimburse the town for all costs arising from the reduction in the service life of any public road or pavement damage, to the extent required by any other town ordinances, resulting from pavement cuts of permittee. Permittee agrees to pay such costs within 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of an invoice from town. 
(13)  Relocation of facilities. 
a.  General. The town shall not bear any cost of relocation of existing facilities, irrespective of the function served, where the town facilities or other facilities occupying the rights-of-way or utility easement of the town under authority of a town permit, license, or franchise which must be relocated, are already located in the rights-of-way and the conflict between the permittee's potential facilities and existing facilities can only be resolved expeditiously as determined by the town by the movement of the existing town or other approved facilities. 
b.  Delay. If permittee's relocation effort so delays construction of a public project causing the town to be liable for delay damages, the permittee shall reimburse the town for those damages attributable to the delay created by the permittee. 
c.  Town costs. Except as otherwise provided in a license, franchise, or permit, or by other provision of law, the entire cost of relocation shall be borne by the town if the permittee is required by the town to relocate facilities which are located in private easements obtained by the permittee prior to the dedication of the public street or easement from which the facilities must be relocated. These prior rights of the permittee would also be unaffected by any subsequent relocation. "Prior rights" as used in this subsection means private easement rights obtained by the permittee prior to the dedication of the streets or public ways from which the facilities are requested by the town to be relocated. In the case of a facility that serves multiple purposes, the prior rights must extend to all uses for this exception to apply. 
(14)  Conflict with designated future freeway corridors. 
a.  The town engineer shall maintain in his office a map depicting the boundaries of designated future freeway corridors within the town. 
b.  Any permittee proposing to install, construct, erect, replace, or relocate facilities within the boundaries of a designated future freeway corridor shall comply with the provisions of this paragraph. 
c.  The town engineer shall establish the locations of rights-of-way within future freeway corridors in the town in which facilities shall be permitted to be installed, constructed, erected, replaced, or relocated ("permitted crossings"). The town engineer shall maintain in his office a description of permitted crossings as a permanent record in a document entitled "Permitted Crossings of Designated Future Freeway Corridors." This document shall be updated at least every six months. 
d.  A permittee proposing to install, construct, erect, replace, or relocate facilities in a public right-of-way or utility easement of the town, which is within a designated future freeway crossing shall place such facilities only in permitted crossings, unless the state department of transportation authorizes a different location for the facilities. Other than in permitted crossings, all applications to install, construct, erect, replace, or relocate facilities in a public right-of-way or utility easement of the town within a designated future freeway corridor must be reviewed and approved by the town engineer and the state department of transportation. 
(15)  Rights reserved to town. Without limiting the rights that the town might otherwise have, the town hereby expressly reserves the following rights, powers and authorities: 
a.  To exercise its governmental powers now or hereafter to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the town. 
b.  To determine any question of fact relating to the meaning, terms, obligations, or other aspects of this chapter and the instruments issued under this chapter. 
c.  To grant multiple, nonexclusive licenses, franchises, licenses, or permits within the town to other persons. 
(16)  Town police power; continuing jurisdiction. 
a.  Police power. The permittee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power by the town, including any and all ordinances, rules, or regulations which the town has adopted or may adopt, and all laws, rules, regulations, order, and policies of the state and the United States government. Any conflict between the provisions of this section and other provisions of the town Code, the stricter requirement shall apply. 
b.  Continuing jurisdiction. The town shall have continuing jurisdiction and supervision over any facilities located within or on town rights-of-way or utility easements of the town. However, it is recognized that the daily administrative, supervisory, and enforcement responsibilities of the provisions of this section and any license or franchise shall be delegated and entrusted to the town manager or director of public works to interpret, administer, and enforce the provisions of this section, and to promulgate standards regarding the construction, reconstruction, relocation, maintenance, dismantling, abandonment, or use of the facilities within the town rights-of-way. 
(17)  Violation. From and after the effective date of this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to occupy the streets and public ways unless the person is in compliance with the provisions of this section and any other applicable ordinance, license, franchise or requirement.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 10-66. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Agency means the state department of environmental quality. 
    Air gap separation (AG) means a physical separation between the free flowing discharge end of a potable water supply pipeline and an open or nonpressure receiving vessel. An approved air gap separation shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the overflow rim of the vessel -0 in no case less than one inch (2.5 cm). 
    Approved means backflow prevention assembly or methods approved by the department as either meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this article, or suitable for the proposed use. 
    Assembly means any system for backflow protection consisting of more than one component and having been tested as one unit, and approved as one unit. 
    Atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) (nonpressure type vacuum breaker) means an assembly containing a float check, a check seat and an air inlet port. The flow of water into the body causes the float to close the air inlet port. When the flow of water stops, the float falls and forms a check valve against backsiphonage and at the same time opens the inlet port to allow air to enter and satisfy the vacuum. A shutoff valve immediately upstream may be an integral part of the assembly. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is designed to protect against a health hazard (i.e. contaminant) under a backsiphonage condition only. 
    Auxiliary water system means a source of water outside of the town's public water supply system. No connection to the town's public water supply system shall be made with any other water system without the approval of the local authority.

    Waivers shall only be considered under the following circumstances: 
(1)  In a residential area with distribution (12 kV) and/or communication lines co-located with transmission lines (69 kV or greater), more than 50 percent of the developed frontage within one-quarter mile on each side of the project must have existing overhead utility lines; or 
(2)  In a non-residential area with distribution (12 kV) and/or communication lines co-located with transmission lines (69 kV or greater), more than 50 percent of the developed frontage within one-eighth mile on each side of the project must have existing overhead utility lines; or 
(3)  The cost of undergrounding the overhead power lines is at least 30 percent of the valuation of the project based on the valuation methodology used in the adopted building code for assessing building permit fees. The developer shall obtain from the appropriate utility companies a reliable estimate of the current cost for undergrounding that is required along the development frontage, including new and existing lines in the adjacent offsite frontage. 
    If an in-lieu payment is authorized by the development engineering manager, the developer shall deposit with the town an approved in-lieu fee in an amount sufficient to cover all undergrounding and restoration that is required. Such in-lieu fee shall be paid by the developer as a condition of final plat approval (residential development) or approval to construct (non-residential development). At the time the in-lieu payment is made, the developer shall enter into a development agreement with the town, defining the terms and conditions of the town's use of the funds, as well as the expiration date and any terms for reimbursement of the in-lieu fees to the developer. The development agreement shall provide a minimum ten-year and a maximum 20-year period during which the town shall use the in-lieu fees. 
    If an in-lieu payment or waiver is denied by the development engineering manager, the developer may appeal the decision to the town council. If an in-lieu payment or waiver is approved by the development engineering manager, any interested party may appeal the decision to the town council. An interested party for the purpose of this section is any person who is affected by the decision and has standing to appeal pursuant to state law. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the town clerk no later than 30 calendar days following the decision of the development engineering manager.

(b)  It is the duty of the building official, before issuing said permit, to investigate and inquire into the sanitary and other conditions of all proposed connections with such sewer system for the purpose of ascertaining whether same may be made in a proper and sanitary condition. In the event the building official finds that the proposed connection may be made or installed in a proper and sanitary condition, it shall be his duty, upon receipt of the appropriate wastewater system development fee, to issue to the applicant a permit, to make or install said proposed connection. 
(c)  Upon the issuance of such permit by the building official, he shall keep a record of all such taps and connections made, the purpose for which same are to be used, and the name of the owner of the property, his agent or representative, for whom the tap or connection was made.

However, if the total cost of the sewer connection from the sewer pipe or main to the property line (including trench backfill and restoration of surface conditions in accordance with town standards) exceeds 150 percent of the cost of construction or replacement of an adequately designed septic system, then this requirement may be waived by application to the town engineer, and if approved, connection may be made to a properly permitted septic system in good working order. An application for waiver shall include at least two bids prepared by licensed contractors in support of the costs alleged therein. The town engineer shall approve or deny a waiver request within 30 days, and that decision may be appealed to the town council.

Sec. 10-336. - Authority for system development fees. 
(a)  Fee report and implementation. The town may assess and collect a system development fee for costs of necessary public services, including all professional services required for the preparation or revision of an infrastructure improvements plan, fee report, system development fee, and required reports or audits conducted pursuant to this article. System development fees shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  The town shall develop and adopt a fee report that analyzes and defines the system development fees to be charged in each service area for each capital facility category, based on the infrastructure improvements plan, calculated pursuant to section 10-339(a)(12) of this article. 
(2)  System development fees shall be assessed against all new commercial, residential, and industrial developments, provided that the town may assess different amounts of system development fees against specific categories of development based on the actual burdens and costs that are associated with providing necessary public services to that category of development. 
(3)  No system development fees shall be charged, or credits issued, for any capital facility that does not fall within one of the categories of necessary public services for which system development fees may be assessed as identified in section 10-339(a)(1) of this article. 
(4)  Costs for necessary public services made necessary by new development shall be based on the same level of service provided to existing development in the same service area. System development fees may not be used to provide a higher level of service to existing development or to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory standards to the extent that these are applied to existing capital facilities that are serving existing development. 
(5)  System development fees may not be used to pay the town's administrative, maintenance, or other operating costs. 
(6)  Projected interest charges and financing costs can only be included in system development fees to the extent they represent principal and/or interest on the portion of any financing or debt used to finance the construction or expansion of a capital facility identified in the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(7)  All system development fees charged by the town must be included in a "fee schedule" prepared pursuant to this article. 
(8)  All system development fees shall meet the requirements of A.R.S. § 9-463.05. 
(b)  Costs per service unit. The fee report shall summarize the costs of capital facilities necessary to serve new development on a per service unit basis as defined and calculated in the infrastructure improvements plan, including all required offsets, and shall recommend a system development fee structure for adoption by the town council. 
(c)  Carry-over of previously established system development fees and grandfathered facilities. Notwithstanding the requirements of this article, certain system development fees adopted by the town prior to the effective date of this article shall continue in effect as follows: 
(1)  System development fees collected prior to January 1, 2012, shall be expended on capital facilities within the same category of necessary public services for which they were collected. 
(2)  The town may continue to collect and use any system development fee established before January 1, 2012, even if the system development fee would not otherwise be permitted to be collected and spent pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-463.05, as amended by the state legislature in SB 1525, Fiftieth Legislature, First Regular Session, if either of the following apply: 
a.  Both of the following conditions are met: 
i.  Prior to June 1, 2011, the system development fee was pledged towards the repayment of financing or debt incurred by the town to provide a capital facility. 
ii.  The applicable capital facility was included in the town's infrastructure improvements plan, or other town planning document prepared pursuant to applicable law, prior to June 1, 2011. 
b.  Before August 1, 2014, the town used the system development fee to finance a capital facility in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05(S). 
(3)  Defined terms in any previously established fee schedule shall be interpreted according to the ordinance in effect at the time of the fee schedule's adoption. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-337. - Administration of system development fees. 
(a)  Separate accounts. System development fees collected pursuant to this article shall be placed in separate funds for each capital facility category within each service area. 
(b)  Limitations on use of fees. System development fees and any interest thereon collected pursuant to this article shall be spent to provide capital facilities associated with the same category of necessary public services in the same service area for which they were collected, including costs of financing or debt used by the town to finance such capital facilities and other costs authorized by this article that are included in the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(c)  Time limit. System development fees collected after July 31, 2014, shall be used within ten years of the date upon which they were collected for all categories of necessary public services except for water and wastewater facilities. For water facilities or wastewater facilities collected after July 31, 2014, system development fees must be used within 15 years of the date upon which they were collected. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-338. - Land use assumptions. 
    The infrastructure improvements plan shall be consistent with the town's current land use assumptions for each service area and each category of necessary public services as adopted by the town pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-463.05. 
(a)  Reviewing the land use assumptions. Prior to the adoption or amendment of an infrastructure improvements plan, the town shall review and evaluate the land use assumptions on which the infrastructure improvements plan is to be based to ensure that the land use assumptions within each service area are consistent with the general plan. 
(b)  Evaluating necessary changes. If the land use assumptions upon which an infrastructure improvements plan is based have not been updated within the last five years, the town shall evaluate the land use assumptions to determine whether changes are necessary. If, after general evaluation, the town determines that the land use assumptions are still valid, the town shall issue the report required in section 10-341 of this article. 
(c)  Required modifications to land use assumptions. If the town determines that changes to the land use assumptions are necessary in order to adopt or amend an infrastructure improvements plan, it shall make such changes as necessary to the land use assumptions prior to or in conjunction with the review and approval of the infrastructure improvements plan pursuant to section 10-341 of this article. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-339. - Infrastructure improvements plan. 
(a)  Infrastructure improvements plan contents. The infrastructure improvements plan shall be developed by qualified professionals and may be based upon or incorporated within the town's capital improvements plan. The infrastructure improvements plan shall: 
(1)  Specify the categories of necessary public services for which the town will impose a system development fee, which may include any or all of the following: 
a.  Water facilities. 
b.  Wastewater facilities. 
c.  Stormwater, drainage, and flood control facilities. 
d.  Library facilities. 
e.  Street facilities. 
f.  Fire and police facilities. 
g.  Park and recreation facilities. 
(2)  Define and provide a map of one or more service areas within which the town will provide each category of necessary public services for which system development fees will be charged. Each service area must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a substantial nexus between the capital facilities to be provided in the service area and the service units to be served by those capital facilities. The town may cover more than one category of capital facilities in the same service area provided that there is an independent substantial nexus or direct benefit, as applicable, between each category of necessary public services and the service units to be served. 
(3)  Identify and describe the land use assumptions upon which the infrastructure improvements plan is based in each service area. 
(4)  Analyze and identify the existing level of service provided by the town to existing service units for each category of necessary public services in each service area. 
(5)  Identify the level of service to be provided by the town for each category of necessary public services in each service area based on the relevant land use assumptions and any established town standards or policies related to required levels of service. 
(6)  For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify the existing capacity of the capital facilities in each service area, the utilization of those capital facilities by existing service units, and the available excess capacity of those capital facilities to serve new service units including any existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity. The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally identify any changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service units, or to meet new safety, efficiency, environmental, or other regulatory requirements for services provided to existing service units. 
(7)  Identify any grandfathered facilities and the impact thereof on the need for necessary public services in each affected service area. 
(8)  Estimate the total number of existing and future service units within each service area based on the town's land use assumptions. 
(9)  Based on the analysis in paragraphs (3) through (6) of this subsection, provide a summary table or tables describing the level of service for each category of necessary public services by relating the required capital facilities to service units in each service area, and identifying the applicable service unit factor associated with each category of development. 
(10)  For each category of necessary public services, analyze and identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing capital facilities, and all new or expanded capital facilities that will be required to provide and maintain the planned level of service in each service area as a result of the new projected service units in that service area, for a period not to exceed ten years. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the town from additionally including in its infrastructure improvements plan projected utilization of, or needs for, capital facilities for a period longer than ten years, provided that the costs of such capital facilities are excluded from the development fee calculation. 
(11)  For each category of necessary public services, estimate the total cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded capital facilities that will be required to serve new service units, including costs of land acquisition, improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs, as well as projected costs of inflation. Such total costs shall not include costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of capital facilities, nor for replacement of capital facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve existing service units. If the infrastructure improvements plan includes changes or upgrades to existing capital facilities that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned level of service to existing service units, or to meet new regulatory requirements for services provided to existing service units, such costs shall be identified and distinguished in the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(12)  Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded capital facilities identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, which shall include estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based on the approved land use assumptions. The infrastructure improvements plan shall additionally estimate the time required to finance, construct and implement the new or expanded capital facilities. 
(13)  Calculate required offsets as follows: 
a.  From the forecasted revenues in paragraph (12) of this subsection, identify those sources of revenue that: 
(i)  Are attributable to new development, and 
(ii)  Will contribute to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services. 
b.  For each source and amount of revenue identified pursuant to paragraph (13)(a) of this subsection, calculate the relative contribution of each category of development to paying for the capital costs of necessary public services in each service area. 
c.  Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to paragraph (13)(b) of this subsection, for each category of necessary public services, calculate the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service area. 
d.  For each category of necessary public services, convert the total offset to be provided to each category of development in each service area into an offset amount per service unit by dividing the total offset for each category of development by the number of service units associated with that category of development. 
e.  Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the required offset, if the town imposes a construction, contracting, or similar excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax classifications in the town, the entire excess portion of the construction, contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the capital costs of necessary public services provided to new development unless the excess portion is already taken into account for such purpose pursuant to this section. 
f.  In determining the amount of required offset for land included in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 4, Article 6, the town shall take into account any capital facilities provided by the district that are included in the infrastructure improvements plan and the capital costs paid by the district for such capital facilities, and shall offset impact fees assessed within the community facilities district proportionally. 
(b)  Multiple plans. An infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to this subsection may address one or more of the town's categories of necessary public services in any or all of the town's service areas. Each capital facility shall be subject to no more than one infrastructure improvements plan at any given time. 
(c)  Reserved capacity. The town may reserve capacity in an infrastructure improvements plan to serve one or more planned future developments, including capacity reserved through a development agreement pursuant to section 10-344 of this article. All reservations of existing capacity must be disclosed in the infrastructure improvements plan at the time it is adopted. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-340. - Adoption and modification procedures. 
(a)  Adopting or amending the infrastructure improvements plan. The infrastructure improvements plan shall be adopted or amended subject to the following procedures: 
(1)  Major amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the adoption or amendment of an infrastructure improvements plan shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule, and may occur concurrently with the adoption of an update of the town's land use assumptions as provided in section 10-338 of this article: 
a.  Sixty days before the first public hearing regarding a new or updated infrastructure improvements plan, the town shall provide public notice of the hearing and post the infrastructure improvements plan and the underlying land use assumptions on its website; the town shall additionally make available to the public the documents used to prepare the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions and any proposed changes to capital facilities. 
b.  The town shall conduct a public hearing on the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions at least 30 days, but no more than 60 days, before approving or disapproving the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(2)  Minor amendments to the infrastructure improvements plan. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, the town may update the infrastructure improvements plan and/or its underlying land use assumptions without a public hearing if all of the following apply: 
a.  The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions will not add any new category of necessary public services to any service area. 
b.  The changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions will not increase the level of service to be provided in any service area. 
c.  Based on an analysis of the fee report and the town's adopted system development fee schedules, the changes in the infrastructure improvements plan and/or the underlying land use assumptions would not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments undertaken pursuant to this subsection, have caused a system development fee in any service area to have been increased by more than five percent above the system development fee that is provided in the current system development fee schedule. 
d.  At least 30 days prior to the date that the any amendment pursuant to this section is adopted, the town shall post the proposed amendments on the town website. 
(b)  Amendments to the fee report. Any adoption or amendment of a fee report and fee schedule shall occur at one or more public hearings according to the following schedule: 
(1)  The first public hearing on the fee report must be held at least 30 days after the adoption or approval of and infrastructure improvements plan as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The town must give at least 30 days' notice prior to the hearing, provided that this notice may be given on the same day as the approval or disapproval of the infrastructure improvements plan. 
(2)  The town shall make the infrastructure improvements plan and underlying land use assumptions available to the public on the town's website 30 days prior to the public hearing described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. 
(3)  The fee report may be adopted by the town no sooner than 30 days, and no later than 60 days, after the hearing described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. 
(4)  The system development fee schedules in the fee report adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective after adoption of the fee report by the town, at the time set forth in A.R.S. 9-463.05. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-341. - Timing for the renewal and updating of the infrastructure improvements plan and the land use assumptions. 
(a)  Renewing the infrastructure improvements plan. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, not later than every five years the town shall update the applicable infrastructure improvements plan and fee report related to each category of necessary public services pursuant to section 10-340 of this article. Such five-year period shall be calculated from the date of the adoption of the infrastructure improvements plan or the date of the adoption of the fee report, whichever occurs later. 
(b)  Determination of no changes. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if the town determines that no changes to an infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, or fee report are needed, the town may elect to continue the existing infrastructure improvements plan and fee report without amendment by providing notice as follows: 
(1)  Notice of the determination shall be published at least 90 days prior to the end of the five-year period described in subsection (a) of this section. 
(2)  The notice shall identify the infrastructure improvements plan and fee report that shall continue in force without amendment. 
(3)  The notice shall provide a map and description of the service area(s) covered by such infrastructure improvements plan and fee report. 
(4)  The notice shall identify an address to which any resident of the town may submit, within 60 days, a written request that the town update the infrastructure improvements plan, underlying land use assumptions, and/or fee report and the reasons and basis for the request. 
(c)  Response to comments. The town shall consider and respond to any timely requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of this section. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-342. - Collection of system development fees. 
(a)  Collection. System development fees, together with administrative charges assessed pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, shall be calculated and collected prior to issuance of permission to commence development; specifically: 
(1)  Unless otherwise specified pursuant to a development agreement adopted pursuant to section 10-344 of this article, system development fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building permit according to the current system development fee schedule for the applicable service area(s) as adopted pursuant to this article, or according to any other system development fee schedule as authorized in this article. 
(2)  If a building permit is not required for the development, but water or wastewater connections are required, any and all system development fees due shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If only a wastewater connection is required, the system development fees shall be paid prior to approval of a connection to the sewer system. Wastewater system development fees shall be assessed if a development either: (i) connects to the public sewer, or (ii) as determined by the town manager or designee, is capable of discharging sewage to a town public sewer. 
(3)  If the development is located in a service area with a stormwater, drainage, and flood control system development fee, and neither a building permit, water, or sewer service connection is required, the storm drainage system development fee due shall be paid at the time any permit is issued for the development. 
(4)  No building permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued if a system development fee is not paid as directed in the previous paragraphs. If a building permit is issued in error, or if construction is commenced without proper authorization, the building permit may be revoked and work on the property ceased until the system development fee is paid in full. 
(5)  If the building permit is for a change in the type of building use, an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an addition to a residential or nonresidential point of demand to the water or wastewater system, the system development fee shall be assessed on the additional service units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the system development fee schedule applicable to any new use type. 
(6)  For issued building permits that expire or are voided, system development fees and administrative charges shall be as follows: 
a.  If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or voided permit, and the system development fees paid for such development have not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any system development fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed. 
b.  If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit applicant shall pay the full system development fees specified in the fee schedule in effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit applicant, the new permit applicant shall pay system development fees as if it were the original permittee. 
(b)  Exceptions. System development fees shall not be owed under either of the following conditions: 
(1)  System development fees have been paid for the development and the building permit(s) that triggered the collection of the system development fees have not expired or been voided. 
(2)  The approval(s) that trigger the collection of system development fees involve modifications to existing residential or non-residential development that do not: 
a.  Add new service units, 
b.  Increase the impact of existing service units on existing or future capital facilities, or 
c.  Change the land-use type of the existing development to a different category of development for which a higher system development fee would have been due. 
To the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements of this paragraph, the system development fee due shall be the difference between the system development fee that was or would have been due on the existing development and the system development fee that is due on the development as modified. 
(c)  Temporary freezing of system development fee schedules. New developments in the town shall be temporarily exempt from increases in system development fees that result from the adoption of new or modified system development fee schedules as follows: 
(1)  On or after the day that the first building permit is issued for a single-family residential development, the town may, and at the permittee's request shall, provide the permittee with an applicable "grandfathered" system development fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable "grandfathered" system development fee schedule, the developer shall pay the fees on that schedule, and any building permit issued for the same single-family residential development shall not be subject to any new or modified system development fee schedule. 
(2)  On or after the day that the final approval, as defined in A.R.S. § 9-463.05(T)(4), is issued for a commercial, industrial or multifamily development, the town shall provide an applicable system development fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site plan or final subdivision plat is given, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable system development fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified system development fee schedule. 
(3)  Any category of development not covered under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall pay system development fees according to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in subsection (a) of this section. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this subsection, if changes are made to a development's final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service units after the issuance of a "grandfathered" system development fee schedule, the town may assess any new or modified system development fees against the additional service units. If the town reduces the amount of an applicable system development fee during the period that a grandfathered system development fee schedule is in force, the town shall assess the lower system development fee. 
(d)  Option to pursue special fee determination. Where a development is of a type that does not closely fit within a particular category of development appearing on an adopted system development fee schedule, or where a development has unique characteristics such that the actual burdens and costs associated with providing necessary public services to that development will differ substantially from that associated with other developments in a specified category of development, the town may require the applicant to provide the town manager or designee with an alternative system development fee analysis. Based on a projection of the actual burdens and costs that will be associated with the development, the alternative system development fee analysis may propose a unique fee for the development based on the application of an appropriate service unit factor, or may propose that the development be covered under the system development fee schedule governing a different and more analogous category of development. The town manager or designee shall review the alternative impact fee analysis and shall make a determination as to the system development fee to be charged. Such decision shall be appealable pursuant to section 10-345 of this article. The town manager or designee may require the applicant to pay an administrative fee to cover the actual costs of reviewing the special fee determination application. 
( Ord. No. 2685, § 3(i), 9-20-18 ) 
Sec. 10-343. - System development fee credits and credit agreements. 
(a)  Eligibility of capital facility. All system development fee credits must meet the following requirements: 
(1)  One of the following is true: 
a.  The capital facility, or the financial contribution toward a capital facility that will be provided by the developer and for which a credit will be issued, must be identified in an adopted infrastructure improvements plan and fee report as a capital facility for which a system development fee was assessed; or 
b.  The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the town that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject capital facility should have been included in the infrastructure improvements plan in lieu of a different capital facility that was included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which a system development fee was assessed. If the subject capital facility is determined to be eligible for a credit in this manner, the town shall amend the infrastructure improvements plan to: 
(i)  Include the subject replacement facility, and 
(ii)  Delete the capital facility that will be replaced. 
(2)  Credits shall not be available for any infrastructure provided by a developer if the cost of such infrastructure will be repaid to the developer by the town through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the developer will be paid or reimbursed by the town for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication from any town funding source including an agreement to reimburse the developer with future collected system development fees pursuant to section 10-344 of this article, any credits claimed by the developer shall be: 
a.  Deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the town; or 
b.  Reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement. 
(b)  Eligibility of subject development. To be eligible for a credit, the subject development must be located within the service area of the eligible capital facility. 
(c)  Calculation of credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the costs for an eligible capital facility identified in the adopted infrastructure improvements plan for which a system development fee was assessed pursuant to the fee report. If the gross impact fee for a particular category of necessary public service is adopted at an amount lower than the maximum amount justified by the fee report, the amount of any credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between the maximum amount justified by the fee report and the gross impact fee adopted. A credit shall not exceed the actual costs the applicant incurred in providing the eligible capital facility. 
(d)  Allocation of credits. Before any credit can be issued to a subject development (or portion thereof), the credit must be allocated to that development as follows: 
(1)  The developer and the town must execute a credit agreement including all of the following: 
a.  The total amount of the credits resulting from provision of an eligible capital facility. 
b.  The estimated number of service units to be served within the subject development. 
c.  The method by which the credit values will be distributed within the subject development. 
(2)  It is the responsibility of the developer to request allocation of system development fee credits through an application for a credit agreement (which may be part of a development agreement entered into pursuant to section 10-344 of this article). 
(3)  If a building permit is issued or a water/sewer connection is purchased, and a system development fee is paid prior to execution of a credit agreement for the subject development, no credits may be allocated retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any remaining permits for the subject development in accordance with this article. 
(4)  If the entity that provides an eligible capital facility sells or relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior to execution of a credit agreement or development agreement, credits resulting from the eligible capital facility will only be allocated to the development if the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s) in interest for the subject development.

(2)  The owner of the subject real property or its predecessor in interest paid a system development fee for the applicable capital facility on or after August 1, 2014, and one of the following conditions exists: 
a.

After collecting the fee to construct a capital facility the town fails to complete construction of the capital facility within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, as it may be amended, and the corresponding service is otherwise unavailable to the subject real property from that capital facility or any other infrastructure. 
c.  For a category of necessary public services other than water or wastewater facilities, any part of a system development fee is not spent within ten years of the town's receipt of the system development fee.

The system development fee was calculated and collected for the construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific capital facility serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs for the capital facility are less than the construction costs projected in the infrastructure improvements plan by a factor of greater than ten percent or more. In such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in this subsection (a), be entitled to a refund for the difference between the amounts of the system development fee charged for and attributable to such construction cost and the amount the system development fee would have been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the fee report. The refund contemplated by this subsection shall relate only to the costs specific to the construction of the applicable capital facility and shall not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for construction of the capital facility that are included in the system development fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05. 
(b)  Earned interest. A refund of a system development fee shall include any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the system development fee by the town from the date of collection to the date of refund; provided, however that interest is not required to be paid if the refund is requested by the developer or property owner due to voluntary cessation or abandonment of work. All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid. 
(c)  Refund to government. If a system development fee was paid by a governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity. 
(d)  Time limitation. Any refund request must be made not later than 180 days following the occurrence of any event described in paragraphs (2)a.-e. of this subsection.

Within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year, the town shall file with the town clerk an unaudited annual report accounting for the collection and use of the fees for each service area and shall post the report on its website in accordance with A.R.S. § 9-463.05, Subsections N and O, as amended.

The two appraisers shall select a third appraiser within 30 days after selection of the second appraiser. If the two appraisers are unable to agree on the appointment of a third appraiser within such 30-day period, either the town or the licensee may petition the presiding civil judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, acting in his or her individual capacity, for the selection of a third appraiser. 
(3)  Each party shall bear the cost of its own appraiser and 1/2 of the cost of appointing the third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee, and of any reasonable expenses incurred by the appraisers in order to carry out the appraisal process. 
(4)  Within 30 days after selection of the third appraiser, the appraisers shall meet for the purpose of determining the manner in which the parties may present evidence which may bear upon the appraisal. Within 90 days after such meeting, the appraiser shall receive and consider such evidence and enter an award determining the fair market value of the cable system consistent with the requirements of this section. Such award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
(c)  Upon the termination of a license and the rights granted thereunder, whether by expiration or forfeiture, the council may direct and require the licensee as provided in section 18-52 to remove its wires, cables, fixtures and accessories and appurtenances from the streets.

The town reserves the right to exercise its power of eminent domain under the Arizona Constitution and laws of the state. 
(b)  Neither the granting of any license nor the enactment of any provision in this chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the town, now existing or hereafter granted. 
(c)  The town's right to acquire the property of the licensee shall not require the licensee to convey such property that is in use for the provision of services other than cable services as to which no license from the town is required, or as to which any license that is required had been obtained. If the cable system is operated by the owner for both telecommunications and cable services purposes, the town must have separate authority outside of this chapter to acquire those facilities used for telecommunications purposes.

(e)  Public hearing. Within 180 days after receiving a new license application, a public hearing shall be held to consider the application and receive public comments. 
(f)  Consideration. In making any determination regarding the new license application, the town may consider any and all factors relevant to interests of the community in cable television including, but not limited to the quality of the cable services proposed, areas to be served, rates to subscriber, benefit to the town, experience, character, background, and financial responsibility of any applicant, and its management and owners, technical and performance quality of equipment, willingness and ability to meet construction and physical requirements, to meet all requirements set forth in this chapter, and to abide by all policy conditions, license limitations and requirements, and all other matters deemed pertinent by the town for satisfying the community needs and for safeguarding the interests of the town and the public. Within a maximum time, after 90 days for cable operators with existing authority to access streets and 180 days for persons that do not have authority to access rights-of-way. The times start on the date an applicant files an application or other writing including certain minimum information which is set forth in section 18-11 and deemed complete by the town. The town and an applicant may agree, in writing, to extend the 90/180-day time period for negotiations. It may then be adopted at the date as permitted by this section 18-16. If the 90/180-day time elapses without action by the town, the applicant is automatically granted an interim license based on the application submitted. Thereafter, the town and applicant may continue to negotiate the terms of a license in an attempt to reach a negotiated license. The 90/180-day time may be tolled by the town if it has requested and not received information from the applicant. 
(g)  Determination. Following the public hearing, the council may direct staff to conduct further negotiations with an applicant, or set further public hearings.

Sec. 18-16. - Grant of additional license and competing service. 
    Since competing or overlapping licenses may encourage the introduction of better cable services and quality at lower prices, the town will at all times attempt to accommodate additional entrants. At the same time it is recognized that the introduction of overlapping cable systems could have a potential adverse impact on the streets, and on the quality and availability of existing cable services to the public. Accordingly, the town shall issue a license in an area where another grantee is operating only following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which the grant of an additional license may have on the community and the streets. In considering whether to grant one or more additional licenses, the town shall specifically consider, and address in a written report, the following issues: 
(a)  Whether or not applicant has provided, at a minimum, information with its application as required by section 18-11, and application fee described in section 18-12. 
(b)  The legal, technical, and financial qualifications of applicant and agreement by a licensee to comply with such requirements of the town as may be determined by it to be applicable to a licensee in conformance with applicable law. 
(c)  Acceptance of a license and the terms therein. 
(d)  The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of streets and private property that may occur if one or more additional licenses are granted. 
(e)  Such other information as the town may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping license.

(Ord. No. 1137, § I, 12-15-98; Ord. No. 2452, § I, 10-3-13) 
Sec. 18-21. - Transfers and assignments. 
(a)  A license shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person, without prior written consent of the town, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The transfer of the existing license to an affiliate of licensee does not require prior approval of the town so long as (a) licensee provided written notice to town at least 30 days prior to the transfer and has provided information sufficient for city to determine that the transfer is as described in (b) or (c) of this section and the proposed transfer will not cause any increased risks of nonperformance of the license or any loss to the town of its bargained for consideration in the license, (b) the transfer is to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with licensee, or (c) a transfer is in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by assignment of any rights, title, or interest of licensee in the license or cable system in order to secure indebtedness. If town objects to the transfer, it shall notify licensee in writing within 20 days of receipt off the written notice, in which case the transfer of control shall be stayed until town confirms in its discretion that it is as described in (b) or (c) above; otherwise, a transfer of control shall be deemed to occur when the legal or practical ability to exert actual working control over the affairs of the licensee transfers to a person other than the licensee, either directly or indirectly, whether by contractual agreement, majority ownership interest, any lesser ownership interest or in any other manner. The transferee must agree to comply with all provisions of the license. 
(b)  Except for a transfer to an affiliate of licensee, no change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the licensee shall occur without prior written consent of the town, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The licensee shall promptly notify the town of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer to, or acquisition by any other party, of control of the licensee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(c)  A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or affiliated group (other than an affiliate of licensee) of more than 25 percent of the voting interest of the licensee or of the person exercising management authority over the licensee. 
(d)  Except in the case of an assignment of the license to an affiliate of licensee, upon written notification by the licensee to the town of a proposed assignment of the license, or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company, the manager shall issue his written notice fixing and setting forth the day, hour and place certain when and where any persons having any interest therein may appear and be heard. The manager shall cause such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the town. The manager also shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the licensee at least ten days prior to the date specified for the hearing. At the time set for such hearing, or at any adjournment thereof, the manager shall proceed to hear the matter. Following the close of such hearing, the manager shall prepare and file with the council his report of the hearing, his findings, and an opinion containing his recommendations and the reasons therefor. If after the expiration of ten days following receipt of the manager's report and opinion, the council shall find that the assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company will not be detrimental or injurious to the best interests and welfare of the subscribers and users, and of the town, then the council by resolution shall consent to the assignment of the license or transfer of control or ownership of the licensee company. Such resolution shall thereupon become and shall be a part of any license granted under this chapter and affected thereby. 
(e)  The consent or approval of the council to any transfer of a license shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the town in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the license. 
(f)  The council may not approve any transfer or assignment of a license involving transfer of 50 percent or more of the ownership interest within three years of and in no event prior to substantial completion of construction of a proposed cable system, unless licensee posts a bond sufficient for the costs of completing construction or provides other assurances acceptable to the town. 
(g)  Fees. Except in the case of an assignment of the license to an affiliate of licensee, and notwithstanding any other requirement of this chapter, each applicant for a transfer or assignment must furnish with its request a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount of $2,500.00 payable in cash, certified or cashier's check wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the manager made payable to the town. No application for a transfer or assignment of license shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The licensee shall be responsible for reimbursing the town's full reasonable costs in excess of the application fee in investigating the qualifications of the transferee under the Cable Act as part of acting on the licensee's request for a transfer or assignment of a license. 
(h)  The town shall act on any request for approval of a sale or transfer within 120 days of the request if the request contains or is accompanied by the information required by the FCC and this chapter. 
(i)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership be approved without the successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the license. 
(j)  As long as a grant, rent or lease does not amount to a transfer as defined in this section and is made in the ordinary course of business with prior notice to the town, a licensee in the normal course of providing cable services may grant, rent, or lease use of its cable system to other persons. Any such use shall be restricted to and consistent with (i) such uses as the licensee is authorized in this chapter and the license, (ii) other telecommunications services which have received a license from town, or (iii) other telecommunications services for which no license is required by the town. Any such use shall be in compliance with applicable federal and state law. Any such grants, lease or rent by the licensee shall not, however, thereby relieve its use of the streets and public ways, and any such grant, rent or lease shall require that such other person comply with the appropriate provisions of this chapter and the license as such use warrants. The grant, lease or rent shall expressly provide for the authority of the town under applicable law to regulate the use provided by the grant, lease or rent (including but not limited to the authority to protect the public welfare, safety and health) and to enforce compliance with any applicable standards established by this chapter or the license. 
(Ord. No. 1137, § I, 12-15-98; Ord. No. 2452, § I, 10-3-13; Ord. No. 2523, § I , 2-19-15) 
Secs. 18-22-18-24. - Reserved. 
Sec. 18-25. - Effect of award of license. 
(a)  Ordinance binding. Upon award of license pursuant to this chapter, a licensee shall be bound by all the terms and conditions contained herein. 
(b)  Incorporation by reference of application for a license. A licensee under a license also agrees to provide all of the cable service specifically set forth in its application, if provided, to provide cable services within the license area and by its acceptance of the license, the licensee specifically agrees that its application is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the license. In the event of a conflict between the license and the application, the provisions of the license shall apply. Failure to provide services as promised in licensee's application or agreed to in its license may be deemed a breach of this chapter to which the provisions of section 18-85 of this chapter shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 1137, § I, 12-15-98) 
Sec. 18-26. - Payment of license fee. 
(a)  In consideration that the streets used by the licensee in the operation of its cable system within the town are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the town at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the licensee for the use of said streets is a valuable property right without which the licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the town will incur costs in regulating and administering the license, the licensee shall pay to the town an amount no less than five percent of licensee's annual gross revenues (the "license fee"). 
(b)  If licensee provides its subscriber an itemized allocation of the discounts provided when the subscriber purchases cable service together with one or more noncable services, then in determining cable service gross revenues licensee shall allocate the discount among the cable and noncable services in accordance with the discounts itemized in the monthly invoice to the subscriber. In determining the discounts itemized in its monthly invoice to the subscriber, licensee shall not discount cable service more than proportionally based on the ratio of the standard nondiscounted charges to the subscriber for each service to the total standard nondiscounted charges for all services. Using the standard nondiscounted charges in the example of proportional allocation of the discount as defined in the following paragraph, on its monthly subscriber invoices licensee may allocate from $0.00 to no more than $15.00 of the total $30.00 discount to cable services. 
If licensee does not itemize allocation of the discounts provided on monthly subscriber invoices when the subscriber purchases cable service together with one or more noncable services, then in determining cable service gross revenues licensee shall allocate the discount proportionally based on the ratio of the standard nondiscounted charges to the subscriber for each service to the total standard nondiscounted charges for all services. For example: If (1) the discount is $30.00, (2) the charge for cable service is $50.00, (3) the charge for internet service is $30.00, (4) the charge for telephone service is $20.00, and (5) therefore the total charge is $100.00, then the discount allocated to cable service shall be $15.00. 
Licensee may allocate the discount differently among noncable services, so long as such allocation does not reduce the gross revenues from cable services below what it would be from the above calculation. 
(c)  Should federal or state laws or regulations be amended in the future to allow the town to receive a greater fee than the fee set forth in subsection (a) then, the town shall have the right to increase the fee to the extent specified in the license, or meet with licensee to modify the license. 
(d)  The payment of the license fee by the licensee to the town shall be made quarterly by delivery of the same to the manager on or before the 20th day of the month following the quarter end, and becomes delinquent on the last business day of that month. Payment shall be accompanied by a license fee payment worksheet provided by the town. If such payment is not made by the next to the last business day of the following month, the town will impose interest at a rate of one and one-half percent per month commencing from the date payment should have been made, unless the payment is subject to a bona fide dispute, and continuing until the payment is made. Fractions of a month shall be considered to constitute a full month for the purpose of computing interest. In addition to interest which may be assessed under this subsection, if licensee fails to pay any license fee, licensee shall be subject to the following civil penalties: 
(1)  A licensee who fails to pay the license fee or any portion thereof within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the unpaid fee each month, unless the licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
(2)  A licensee who fails or refuses to pay a license fee or any portion thereof after notice and demand by the town shall pay a penalty of 25 percent of the unpaid fee, unless licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
(3)  If the cause of failure to pay the licensee fee or any portion thereof is determined by the town to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the license fee, the licensee shall pay a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of deficiency. 
(e)  The town and licensee each shall have the right to inspect the licensee's cable service income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter provided, however, that such audit shall take place within 36 months following the close of each of the licensee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the town as a result of the audit shall be paid within 30 days following written notice to the licensee by the town, said notice shall include a copy of the audit report; provided, however, that licensee shall not be required to pay such deficiency until 30 days after completion of the administrative review process if licensee commences such process pursuant to subsection 18-86(a)(3). If there is a deficiency in the payment of license fees to the town of ten percent or more, the town may assess the cost of the audit to the licensee. If town owes a refund to licensee or if licensee owes additional amounts to town, town and licensee shall agree upon a reasonable repayment schedule with interest from the date of request until paid at the rate provided for hereunder. 
(f)  In compliance with applicable law, licensee shall not be required to pay any rental, application, construction permit, inspection, inconvenience or other fees or charges which town imposes under town code requirements related to licensee's use of town streets.

Sec. 18-27. - Use of telephone facilities. 
    If a licensee uses a telephone company's cable system distribution channels furnished to the licensee pursuant to tariff or contract on file with a regulatory body having jurisdiction and licensee makes no use of the streets independent of such telephone company furnished facilities, licensee remains fully bound by the terms of its license and this chapter.

Sec. 18-34. - General provisions concerning access and public safety channels. 
(a)  Application. The provisions of this section shall apply to all access channels and public safety channels. 
(b)  Technical design of access channels and responsibilities. 
(1)  In general, town or its designees (other than licensee) is responsible for: 
a.  Delivering channel signals to the licensee at origination points and processing the signals so that they can be carried on the cable system; and receiving signals from licensees at all connection points to public buildings, and origination points;

(c)  Maximum utilization. The licensee shall not take any actions that would discourage or prevent maximum utilization of all access channels provided, and shall cooperate with the town and managers of access channels to ensure that subscribers are aware of the channels, can access them easily, and, to the extent that a licensee (or some entity acting on a licensee's behalf) is involved in publishing licensee's channel schedules, that the access channels are similarly published. 
(d)  Public building connections. Upon request of the town and consistent with the joint trench requirements of subsection (e), the licensee shall provide, without charge, at a minimum, one activated standard drop to all of the following present and future public buildings, as designated by the town from time to time.

(e)  Joint trench requirements. The town shall notify licensee in writing at least 30 days prior to opening trenches for use by utilities to serve public buildings. If such notice is given and subject to the construction or rebuild schedule and line extension policy, licensee shall install cable facilities in order to provide the connection to the public building without charge for trenching. If no notice is given, the town shall pay the reasonable cost of such trenching. 
(f)  Use of unused access channel capacity. Town shall allow licensee to utilize any unused access channel capacity, but not any programmed time and licensee may not rearrange or reschedule any programming upon any access channel, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Any request from licensee to use any unused capacity of an access channel must be submitted in writing to the town and shall state the amount of time that locally produced programming is on the access channel. 
(2)  Town shall approve the request to use unused licensee access channel capacity if it finds that (i) the utilization of the channel is as represented; (ii) the licensee has not acted in violation of the provisions of the license or this chapter regarding utilization of the channel; and (iii) there are not special circumstances which would justify denial or delay of implementation of the use of the channel.

The cost for any equipment, operation or maintenance dedicated to such access interconnections shall be shared on pro rata basis or as mutually agreed upon among all participating jurisdictions, and paid to licensee. 
(4)  A licensee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect or the town may rescind its order to interconnect upon petition by the licensee to the town. The town shall grant said request, if it finds that a licensee negotiated in good faith and failed to obtain an approval from another cable system(s), governmental entity or educational institution for the proposed interconnection.

If there is more than one licensee providing cable service in the town, the town will use its best efforts to assure that the licensee's capital expenditures for access channels, facilities and equipment are reasonably equivalent as provided in the license. To the extent licensee's rates for cable services are subject to regulation, and to the extent consistent with applicable law, licensee shall have the right to treat such capital expenditures as external costs in support of access channels in setting regulated rates for cable services. 
(j)  Access channels on basic service tier. All access channels provided to subscribers shall be included, without limitation, on all basic tiers, including digital basic. 
(k)  Change in technology. In the event a licensee makes any change in the cable system and related equipment and facilities or in licensee's signal delivery technology, licensee shall ensure that town analog signals are converted by licensee and the signal quality or transmission of access services or programming remains substantially the same.

(m)  Access cooperation. Town and licensee may agree to designate any other jurisdiction which has entered into an agreement with the licensee or an affiliate of the licensee to receive any access benefit due the town hereunder, or to share in the use of access services, facilities, equipment or channel operations hereunder. The purpose of this subsection shall be to allow cooperation in the use of access channels, facilities and equipment.

Sec. 18-42. - Line extension. 
(a)  Residential service. After completion of construction in an area pursuant to a construction schedule, a licensee shall make cable services available to dwelling units within the town and shall extend its cable system as follows: 
(1)  Each unit in a multiple dwelling unit (MDU) shall be counted as a dwelling unit in determining residential density where a mutually acceptable agreement granting licensee reasonable access to the MDU has been executed by the owner of the property and delivered to the licensee. Licensee shall not be required to make service available to residents of a MDU where the owner of the property has not granted licensee such reasonable access to the property. 
(2)  When requested by a resident in the town, licensee shall, at licensee's sole expense, extend the cable system to any single family residence or dwelling within the town, provided that the residence or dwelling is located within 225 feet of the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system or such extension involves density of 25 existing homes per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest existing technically feasible point of connection on the cable system. Such extension(s) shall include cutting in one or more taps and extending cable as necessary. 
(3)  When a resident in the town requests an extension of service to an area that does not meet the minimum density of 25 existing homes per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest existing technically feasible point of connection on the cable system, licensee shall be required to comply with such request only if the resident agrees to pay to the licensee an amount equal to all actual incremental costs incurred beyond those for an extension otherwise involving a density of 25 existing homes per mile. The incremental costs to be paid shall be licensee's costs (reasonable labor and materials) of extending the cable system consistently with licensee's overall system design to the residence from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system. The costs shall include splicing in one or more taps and extending cable. 
(4)  When a developer of a residential subdivision to be built in the town requests an extension to serve the subdivision, licensee shall comply with the request in accordance with this subsection. Licensee shall extend the cable system to serve the subdivision at licensee's expense if the nearest boundary of the subdivision is no greater than 225 feet from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system and if the subdivision meets the line extension requirements in (2) measured from the boundary point. If the subdivision does not meet the requirements of (2), licensee shall extend the cable system within the subdivision if the developer agrees to pay licensee's actual incremental costs (reasonable labor and materials) incurred beyond those for an extension otherwise involving a density of 25 existing homes per mile determined as in (2). If the nearest technically feasible point of connection is greater than 225 feet from the subdivision and the developer agrees to pay licensee's incremental costs of extending the cable system from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system to the nearest street access to the subdivision and within the subdivision, licensee shall then extend the cable system to and within the subdivision. Licensee's incremental costs in extending to and within the subdivision are the costs (reasonable labor and materials) incurred beyond those for an extension otherwise involving a density of 25 existing homes per mile determined as in (2). 
(5)  A license may provide for different line extension requirements from that required in subsections (2), (3) and (4). 
(6)  To prevent unnecessary disruption and damage to streets, rights-of-way, and other property, the installation of underground cable shall be accomplished in new subdivisions that meet the requirements of (2) at the same time, and in the same trench as other communications, electric and other permanent services to structures, unless to do so would be economically infeasible. Except as federal law may grant them other rights, developers of new residential buildings or mobile homes within a new or undeveloped subdivision, new residential units within new multiple occupancy residential developments, and new commercial and industrial buildings and structures shall treat cable television facilities as they treat other communication facilities, utilities and other underground facilities, in regards to availability and cost of trenching for undergroundings. 
(7)  Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of circumstances beyond licensee's reasonable control, an extension of service pursuant to subsections (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section shall be accomplished within 120 days of the developer's or resident's request. 
(8)  Licensee shall not be required to install the cable system or conduit in the joint trench of a new subdivision or to provide cable service to residents of the subdivision when the developer or homeowner's association of the subdivision has entered into an agreement in which another party has agreed to provide cable television or other comparable video services to all residents of the subdivision and in which the subscribers fees for such services are paid to the provider from collection of homeowners association fees. However, upon termination of such agreement, the line extension required by this section shall apply. 
(9)  When a drop or linear trench or aerial strand footage enters or crosses a designated future freeway corridor shown on the map maintained by the town engineer under subsection 10-5(d)(15) of this Code, the routs from the nearest existing technically feasible point of connection in the cable system shall be measured in permitted crossings established by the town engineer under that subsection. This subsection also applies to subsection 18-42(b). 
(b)  Commercial service. After completion of construction in an area pursuant to a construction schedule, a licensee shall make cable services available to commercial establishments as follows, except licensee shall not be required to make service available to commercial establishments where the owner of the property has not granted licensee reasonable access to the property: 
(1)  When requested by the owner of a commercial establishment, provided that no plant extension and nothing more than a standard drop is required to make cable services available or provided that the building is located within 225 feet of the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the cable system. 
(2)  When the owner of a commercial or industrial establishment within the town requests an extension of service that does not meet a minimum 225 foot distance requirement or 100 hook ups per cable plant mile, licensee shall be required to comply with such request only if such owner pays to licensee an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by licensee over and above the cost of a standard drop in making cable services available. Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, an extension of service shall be accomplished within 120 days of owner's execution of any necessary easement documents and capital contribution agreements. 
(3)  A license may provide for different line extension requirements from that required in subsections (1) and (2). 
(c)  Service drops. 
(1)  Licensee shall make service available to any single family residence or any commercial establishment within the town at applicable standard connection charge if the connection requires a standard drop. 
(2)  If making service available requires more than a standard drop, licensee shall not be required to make such service available unless the person requesting service pays to licensee (i) the standard connection charge and (ii) an amount equal to the reasonable actual labor and material costs incurred by licensee for the additional facilities and work. 
(3)  Licensee may offer bulk billing service, but shall not require a bulk billing agreement as a condition of providing service. 
(4)  Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, (i) any standard drop to a single family residence or dwelling shall be accomplished within TEN business days after an order has been placed, and (ii) any drop that is not a standard drop shall be accomplished within a reasonable time under the circumstances. Line extensions shall be done as provided in subsection 18-42(a). 
(5)  Absent a showing by licensee to the manager of unusual circumstances, including without limitation street crossings, (i) any standard drop to a commercial establishment shall be accomplished within ten days after the owner of such commercial establishment executes any necessary easement documents and capital contribution agreements, and (ii) any commercial drop that is not a standard drop shall be accomplished within a reasonable time under the circumstances. 
(d)  If a licensee elects to extend cable service to a customer in a licensed area which does not meet the density requirements of this section, the licensee shall not refuse to extend service to any other customer in the same area solely on the grounds that service to the first customer was not in the area required under the density requirements set forth in this section. 
(e)  The line extension requirements set forth in this section shall not apply to any area covered by a construction phase described in the construction schedule until the construction phase for that area has been completed. 
(f)  Discrimination prohibited. No person, firm or corporation in the existing cable service area of the licensee shall be arbitrarily refused cable services; provided, however, that the licensee shall not be required to provide cable services to any subscriber who does not pay the applicable line extension connection fee and/or cable service charge(s). 
(g)  Annexed territory. Newly annexed territory shall be subject to the terms of this chapter and this section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 1136, § I, adopted Dec. 8, 1998, repealed §§ 19-1-19-9, which derived from Ord. No. 1075, § I(19-1, 19-2, 19-3.1-19-3.5, 19-4.1, 19-4.2), adopted Dec. 16, 1997. Said ordinance added new §§ 19-1-19-5, which pertained to similar subject matter. 
Ord. No. 1143, § I, adopted Jan. 19, 1999, repealed §§ 19-10-19-14, which derived from Ord. No. 1075, § I(19-5.1-19-5.5), adopted Dec. 16, 1997. 

Sec. 19-1. - Purposes, findings, intent, and applicability. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish policy governing the management of public highways for the provision of telecommunications services to enable the town to: 
(1)  Issue licenses and franchises to telecommunications corporations who use the public highways to provide telecommunications services on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, except in cases where state law forbids establishment of a license or franchise requirement; and 
(2)  Manage the public highways in order to minimize the impact and cost to town citizens of the placement of telecommunications facilities within public highways; and 
(3)  Manage the public highways so as to maximize their efficient use, thereby minimizing the foreclosure of future additional uses of such rights-of-way; and 
(4)  Provide for the compensation for the commercial use of public highways to provide telecommunications services; and 
(5)  Minimize congestion, inconvenience, visual impact, and other adverse effects from such use on the town's public highways. 
(b)  Findings. The town council finds that the town's public highways constitute a valuable public asset: 
(1)  Having been acquired and maintained by the town over many years at great taxpayer expense; 
(2)  Providing uniquely valuable property that private telecommunications providers may wish to use for profit-making purposes that may not necessarily benefit all the residents of the town; 
(3)  Representing public investments for which the taxpayers are entitled to a fair monetary return on the town's past and future investment in the town's infrastructure; and 
(4)  Comprising significant assets, which the town must manage as a public fiduciary trust to enhance the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(c)  Intent. Therefore, the town council intends: 
(1)  To ensure that locally elected officials manage local public highways consistent with their fiduciary trust obligations; 
(2)  To ensure compliance with public health, safety, and welfare measures for public highways; 
(3)  To encourage public-private partnerships to provide telecommunications facilities needed for the most cost-effective delivery of public services, including schools, libraries, police and fire protection, as well as private services; 
(4)  To conserve the limited physical capacity of the public highways held in public trust by the town; and 
(5)  To assure that the town's current and ongoing costs of granting and regulating private access to and use of the public highways are fully paid by the persons seeking such access and causing such costs. 
(d)  Applicability. Chapter 19 of this Code and the Unified Land Development Code shall govern the management and use of public highways within the town for the provision of telecommunications services except that the use of town rights-of-way and public utility easements of the town related to small wireless facilities shall be governed by chapter 10 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 2631 , § I, 11-2-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2631 , § I, adopted Nov. 2, 2017, amended § 19-1 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former § 19-1 pertained to purposes and findings and derived from Ord. No. 1136, § I, adopted Dec. 8, 1998.

    Cable services and cable system shall have the same meaning as defined in chapter 18 of this Code. 
    Commercial mobile radio service means two-way voice commercial mobile radio service as defined by the Federal Communications Commission in 47 United States Code Section 157. 
    Facilities means the plant, equipment, and property used in the provision of telecommunications services and not owned by the town, including but not limited to poles, wires, pipe, conduits, pedestals, antenna, and other appurtenances placed in, on, or under highways and not owned by the town and used in the provision of telecommunication services. 
    Public highway or highway means all roads, streets and alleys and all other dedicated public rights-of-way and public utility easements of the town. 
    Telecommunications means the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received. The term does not include commercial mobile radio services, pay phone services or cable services. 
    Telecommunications corporation means any public service corporation to the extent that it provides telecommunications services in this state. 
(Ord. No. 1136, § I, 12-8-98; Ord. No. 1380, § I, 1-8-02) 
Sec. 19-3. - License or franchise required. 
(a)  No telecommunications corporation shall install, maintain, construct or operate telecommunications facilities in any public highway in the town, unless a license to use the highways to provide telecommunications services has first been granted by the council under this chapter or a franchise awarded by the electorate under Article XIII of the Arizona Constitution and this chapter to such telecommunications corporation. 
(b)  Nothwithstanding subsection (a), any telecommunications corporation that was providing telecommunications service within this state as of November 1, 1997, pursuant to a grant made to it or its lawful predecessors prior to the effective date of the Arizona Constitution, may continue to provide telecommunications services pursuant to that state grant, until and unless the state grant is lawfully repealed, revoked or amended, and need not obtain any further grant from the town to provide telecommunications services,; provided, however, that such entity must in all other respects comply with the requirements applicable to the telecommunications corporations as provided in Title 9, Chapter 5, Article 7 of the Arizona Revised Statutes. 
(c)  Nothing in this article shall be deemed to affect the terms or conditions of any franchise, license, or permit issued by the town prior to the effective date of the amendments of this article or to release any party from its obligations thereunder. Those franchises, licenses or permits shall remain fully enforceable in accordance with their terms. The town manager, with the consent of the council, may enter into agreements with franchise holders, licensees or permittees to modify or terminate an existing franchise, license or agreement. 
(d)  A franchise or license to any telecommunications corporation to use the highways to install, maintain, construct or operate telecommunications facilities shall not authorize the use of the highways to provide any other service; nor shall the issuance of the same invalidate any franchise, license or permit that authorizes the use of the highways for such other services; nor shall the fact that a telecommunications corporation holds a franchise, license or permit to make any other use of the highway or to provide any other service, authorize installation, maintenance, construction or operation of telecommunications facilities in any highway in the town, without obtaining a license or franchise hereunder. 
(e)  Any license or franchise granted shall not be exclusive. 
(f)  A telecommunications licensee may enter into contracts for use of its facilities within the public highways to provide telecommunication services. Persons using such licensee's facilities must themselves obtain a telecommunication license if such person constructs, installs, operates or maintains telecommunication facilities within the public highway of the town. If the persons using such licensee's facilities do not construct, install, operate or maintain telecommunication facilities within the public highway of the town, such persons need not obtain a separate license but the telecommunications licensee must disclose the identity of such persons to the town. 
(Ord. No. 1136, § I, 12-8-98; Ord. No. 1181, § I, 7-6-99; Ord. No. 1380, § I, 1-8-02) 
Sec. 19-4. - License application. 
(a)  Any telecommunications provider desiring a license or franchise under this chapter to construct, install, operate and maintain telecommunications facilities in streets and other highways of the town shall file an application with the town manager requesting at the applicant's election either a franchise or license, in the form prescribed by the town, and shall pay an application fee of $2,500.00 payable in cash, certified or cashier's check, wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the manager, made payable to the town. No application shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the town's full reasonable costs in excess of the application, including, in the case of an application for a franchise, costs of an election. The application fee is in addition to any permit fees established pursuant to section 10-5 of this Code. 
(b)  Each application shall, at a minimum, (1) show where the facilities the applicant will use will be located, or contain such other information as the town may deem necessary in order to ensure that the applicant will comply with requirements for use of the highways; (2) identify the applicant, its name, address and telephone number; (3) contain a description of the services to be provided; and (4) set out a description of any agreement with any other entity that would permit such entity to use the facilities. 
(c)  Upon receiving an application for a license or franchise that satisfies the conditions of section (b), the town shall promptly proffer a telecommunications license or franchise to the applicant for its review, and may inquire into matters relevant to the issuance of the license or franchise. If the applicant agrees to the terms and conditions of the license or franchise, the request shall be submitted to the council with a recommendation for approval (in the case of a license) or a franchise election (in the case of an application for a franchise). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the town need not issue or renew a license or franchise, or schedule a franchise election, if the applicant has previously had a license or franchise revoked, or for any other reason permitted under Arizona law. 
(d)  As a condition of issuing or renewing a license or franchise to use the public highways to, construct, install, operate and maintain telecommunications facilities, the town may require: 
(1)  Proof that the applicant has received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Arizona Corporation Commission except that this requirement shall not apply to a telecommunications corporation that provides solely interstate telecommunication services within the state. 
(2)  The applicant to agree to comply with highway use requirements that the town may establish from time to time; 
(3)  The applicant to agree to provide and maintain accurate maps showing the location of all its facilities and the facilities it will use in the highways within the town, and to comply with such other mapping requirements as the town may establish from time to time. Applicant shall provide the town with electronic mapping information in a format compatible with the current town electronic mapping format. 
(4)  The applicant to obtain the insurance, and provide proof of insurance as required by the town; to post the performance bonds and security fund required by the town; and to agree to fully indemnify the town, its officers, agents, boards and commissions, in a form satisfactory to the town; and agree that it shall have no recourse whatsoever against the town or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense or damages arising out of any provision or requirement of the town because of the enforcement of the license or franchise or because of defects in this chapter or the license or franchise issued. 
(5)  The applicant to agree to comply with and be bound by the administrative and enforcement provisions as may be prescribed from time to time by the town; 
(e)  Every franchise or license shall be subject to the following administrative and enforcement provisions: 
(1)  Franchises and licenses shall be personal to the franchisee or licensee. Except as provided in the license or franchise, no transfer of a franchise, franchisee, license or licensee, or change of control over the same (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or any other means) shall occur unless prior application is made to the town and the town's prior written consent is obtained, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In making a determination as to whether to approve a transfer the town may consider the same information and qualifications required of an original application for a license or franchise; whether the licensee or franchisee is in compliance with its license or franchise and this chapter and, if not, the proposed transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transfer would result in an evasion of other applicable provisions of law, or impair lawful contracts; and the effect of the transfer on the town's interest. No application for a transfer of a license or franchise shall be granted unless the proposed transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of the chapter and the license or franchise, and that it will assume all obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous licensee or franchisee under this chapter and the license or franchise for all purposes, including renewal. Approval by the town of a transfer of a license or franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the town under this chapter or the franchise or license, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(2)  Every franchisee or licensee shall be subject to the town's exercise of such police, regulatory and other powers as it now has or may later obtain, and a franchise or license may not waive the application of the same. 
(3)  Every franchise or license shall be subject to revocation if the franchisee or licensee fails to comply with the material terms and conditions of the license or franchise, or applicable law. Provided, however, that a franchise or license shall not be revoked unless the franchisee or licensee is given written notice of the defect in performance, and fails to cure the performance within 60 days of the notice, except where the town finds that the defect in performance is due to intentional misconduct, is a violation of criminal law, or is part of a pattern of violations where the franchisee or licensee has already had notice and opportunity to cure. A hearing shall be held before a license is revoked if the licensee requests a hearing. 
(4)  Penalties for violation of franchise or license. 
(5)  Damages for violation of the franchise or license terms. Any remedies available to the town are cumulative, and are not limited by the recovery of any amounts pursuant to the insurance provisions of the license or franchise, or pursuant to any indemnity clause. 
(6)  A requirement that if the franchisee or licensee fails to pay amounts owed to the town by the time prescribed for payment, the franchisee or licensee shall pay interest on the amounts owed, at the rate of one percent per month. 
(7)  A requirement that franchisee or licensee shall produce books and records for the town's inspection and copying, prepare reports, respond to questions and permit the town to have access to its facilities as the town may request in order to determine whether licensee or franchisee has complied with its obligations under the franchise or license, or other applicable law. 
(f)  A licensee that receives a telecommunications service license pursuant to this chapter may apply for a renewal of its license, which renewal shall be reviewed in accordance with the requirement of state law. 
(g)  The issuance of a license, permit or other authorization by the town is not a representation or warranty that such license, permit, or authorization is a legally sufficient substitute for a franchise, and it not a representation or warranty that a franchise is not required. 
(h)  Any license granted by the town pursuant to this chapter shall commence upon adoption of the license and acceptance of the license by the provider within 30 days of the grant. The license shall be effective for a period of five years, and subject to the conditions and restrictions provided in the instrument and this chapter.

Sec. 19-5. - Compensation. 
(a)  The town shall not levy a tax, rent, fee or charge to a telecommunications corporation for the use of a public highway to provide telecommunications services, or levy a tax, fee or charge upon the privilege of engaging in the business of providing telecommunications services, except that, in connection with its provisions of telecommunications services and its use of the highways to provide the same, each telecommunications corporation shall: 
(1)  Pay a transaction privilege tax on the business of providing telecommunications services or applicable use tax, as may be specified from time to time in chapter 58 of this Code. 
(2)  Pay public highway construction permit fees established from time to time by the town pursuant to chapter 10 of this Code.

(4)  A telecommunications corporation that has placed facilities in public highways that carry interstate traffic between and among the telecommunication corporation's points of presence exclusive of facilities used by the local network and the portion of the interstate network that carries intrastate calls, shall pay an annual fee based on the number of linear feet of trench in the public highways. The rate per linear foot shall be set by council resolution and shall not exceed the highest rate per linear foot a political subdivision charged a licensee or franchisee on or before December 31, 1999. The rate per linear foot shall not be increased in any year by more than the increase in the average consumer price index as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
(5)  The licensee may provide in-kind benefits such as facilities or services to the town if agreed to by the town and licensee. The calculation of the in-kind benefits shall be set forth in the license. Any in-kind facilities provided to the town under the license shall remain in possession and ownership of the town after the term of the license expires. The value of in-kind benefits shall be less than or equal to, and may be offset against, payments of interstate linear foot charges or transaction privilege tax on the business of providing telecommunications service owed to the town, but shall not be offset for any combination of intrastate and interstate charges. 
(b)  Nothing in this section is intended to limit the obligation of any person to pay amounts owed under any franchise or license. Provided that, for franchises or licenses issued after the effective date of this ordinance, payments required under such franchise or license for the provision of telecommunications services shall comply with the provisions of A.R.S. § 9-581. 
(c)  If the provider disputes the amount of town construction permit fees or other fees payable under this chapter, the matter shall be referred to a dispute resolution board. The board shall consist of three members agreed upon by both parties. Expenses for the board shall be shared equally by the town and the provider. The board will hear the dispute promptly, and render a decision within 20 days after the hearing. All decisions of the board are non-binding on the town and provider; however, the findings of the board shall be admissible in any legal action. The town and the provider shall accept or reject findings of the board within 30 days after receipt of the findings. If damages are assessed by the board, the provider shall pay town within 30 days of receipt of an invoice. Late charges of five percent and interest charges of one and one-half percent per month shall be added for late payment.

(b)  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Protect human life and health; 
(b)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(f)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize blight areas caused by flooding; 
(g)  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
(h)  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions; and 
(i)  Maintain eligibility for disaster relief. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-34. - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    These regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances and codes. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(d)  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(e)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

The Gilbert town council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

    Sheet flow area. See "area of shallow flooding." 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA). An area in the floodplain subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on a flood boundary and floodway map or flood insurance rate map as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, and AH. 
    Start of construction. Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.

(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(7)  Obtain and maintain improvement calculations. 
(e)  Notification of other entities. 
(1)  Whenever a watercourse is to be altered or relocated: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the Arizona Department of Water Resources prior to such alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency through appropriate notification means; and 
b.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse be maintained. 
(2)  Base flood elevation and rate of flow due to physical alterations: 
a.  Base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the floodplain administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data in accordance with Volume 44 Code of Federal Regulations Section 65.3. Such a submission is necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements will be based upon current data. 
b.  Within 120 days after completion of construction of any flood control protective works which changes the rate of flow during the flood or the configuration of the floodplain upstream or downstream from or adjacent to the project, the person or agency responsible for installation of the project shall provide to the governing bodies of all jurisdictions affected by the project a new delineation of all floodplains affected by the project. The new delineation shall be done according to the criteria adopted by the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources. 
(3)  Corporate boundary changes:

(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-51. - Standards for storage of materials and equipment. 
(a)  The storage or processing of materials that could be injurious to human, animal or plant life if released due to damage from flooding is prohibited in special flood hazard areas. 
(b)  Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to damage by floods and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or if readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-52. - Standards for utilities. 
(a)  All new or replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge from systems into floodwaters. 
(b)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(c)  Waste disposal systems shall not be installed wholly or partially in a regulatory floodway. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-53. - Additional development standards, including subdivisions. 
(a)  All new subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions), greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
(1)  Identify the area of the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
(2)  Identify on the final plans the elevation(s) of the proposed structure(s) and pads. If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the final lowest floor and grade elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator.

(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 

Sec. 34-57. - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the town to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-58. - Appeal board. 
(a)  The floodplain board of the town shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  In passing upon such applications, the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and, 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges. 
(d)  Upon consideration of the factors of section 34-58(c) and the purposes of this article, the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property; and 
(3)  The land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by A.R.S. Title 26, Chapter 2, Article 2. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the Maricopa County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(f)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2454, § I(Att.), 10-16-13) 
Sec. 34-59. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of divisions 3 and 4 of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(b)  Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(c)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(d)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(e)  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
(1)  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
(3)  Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in section 34-35 of this article in the definition of "functionally dependent use"; and 
(4)  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Sec. 42-33. - Discharge of water into town drainage basins. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to discharge, or permit to be discharged, water from a swimming pool or similar facility into a drainage basin of the town without first receiving permission from the director of public works. 
(Ord. No. 1620, § I, 2-1-05) 
Sec. 42-34. - Light and glare. 
(a)  Purpose; findings. The town council finds that excess light can and does interfere with the private enjoyment of property, causes safety hazards to the driving public which can result in accidents and injury, and interferes with astronomical observations. The council further finds that excess light and light trespass constitute nuisances. The elimination of excess light is in furtherance of the health, welfare and safety of the residents and driving public of the Town of Gilbert. 
(b)  General. Outdoor lighting shall be required for safety and personal security in areas of public assembly and traverse for multi-family developments, as well as municipal, commercial, industrial, and institutional uses where there is outdoor public activity during hours of darkness. Glare and light trespass control shall be required to protect inhabitants from the consequences of stray light shining in inhabitants' eyes or onto neighboring properties. Light pollution control shall be required to minimize the negative effect of misdirected upward light. The glare, light trespasses and light pollution requirements of this division shall apply to all uses, including residential. these standards implement the town's general plan. 
(c)  Outdoor lighting. Outdoor lighting shall be designed so as to meet the following goals: 
(1)  Reduce impact of outdoor lighting on residential neighborhoods. 
(2)  Provide minimal spill light in the nighttime sky. 
(3)  Encourage the use of energy efficient lighting systems. 
(4)  Provide a frame work for lighting practices as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. 
(d)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the following meanings ascribed to them unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
(1)  Filtered : The use of an outer lens, which serves to control the spectral distribution from a light source. The outer lens shall be glass, acrylic or some other translucent enclosure. Quartz glass does not comply with this requirement. 
(2)  Full cutoff : Fixtures that are constructed in such a manner that light rays emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture, are projected below a horizontal plane running through the lowest point on the fixture where light is emitted. 
(3)  Fully shielded : Providing internal and/or external shields and louvers to prevent brightness from lamps, reflectors, refractors, and lenses from causing glare at normal viewing angles. 
(4)  Glare : The sensation produced by luminance within the visual field that is sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility. Note: the magnitude of the sensation of glare depends upon such factors as the size, position, and luminance of the source and the luminance to which the eyes are adapted. 
(5)  Installed : Set up and fixed in position for use. 
(6)  Low wattage : If from an incandescent fixture, 150 watts or less; if from other sources, 70 watts or less. 
(7)  Outdoor light fixtures : Artificial illuminating devices, lamps and other contrivance, located in the open air, not within an enclosed structure, that is permanent or portable, used for illumination or advertisement. Such devices include, but are not limited to, search, spot or flood lights for buildings and structures, recreational areas, parking lot lights, landscape lights, billboards and other signage and street lights. 
(8)  Semi-cutoff : Fixtures constructed in a manner such that the bottom ledge of the lens extends below the bottom plane of the fixture, allowing minimal light.

Additionally, said ordinance set out new §§ 42-62 and 42-65. The historical notation has been retained with the amended provisions for reference purposes. 

Sec. 42-61. - Noise. 
(a)  Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the town to prohibit unnecessary, excessive and offensive noises from all sources subject to its police power. At certain levels, noises are detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry, and in the public interest, such noise shall be systematically proscribed. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    "A" band level means the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using a-weighting network. The unit is the dB(A). 
    Ambient noise means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. For the purpose of this section, ambient noise level is the level obtained when the noise level is averaged over a period of 15 minutes in commercial areas and industrial areas and over a period of five minutes in residential areas without inclusion of noise from isolated identifiable sources, at the location and time of day near that at which a comparison is to be made. Averaging may be done by instrumental analysis in accordance with American National Standard Specifications for Sound Level Meters S13-1971, or may be done manually as follows: 
(1)  Observe a sound level meter for five seconds and record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and lowest indications. 
(2)  Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to ensure that observations are made at the beginning and the end of the applicable averaging period (15 minutes in commercial areas and industrial areas, and five minutes in residential areas) and that there are at least as many additional observations as there are decibels between the highest high indication and the lowest low indication. 
(3)  Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications. 
    Commercial area means an area located within a commercial zoning district, Heritage Village Center zoning district (HVC), neighborhood office zoning district (NO), general office zoning district (GO), Gateway Village Center zoning district (GVC) or Gateway Business Center zoning district (GBC) pursuant to the town land development code. 
    Community noise standards means the noise standards set forth in subsection (e)(1). 
    Decibel (dB) means a sound pressure that is 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, two × 10 -5 newton/meter 2 . 
    Emergency work means any work performed to prevent or alleviate physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an emergency which has or may result in a disruption of service and which is necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect the health, safety or welfare of persons or property or work by private or public utilities when restoring utility service. 
    Frequency of a function periodic in time shall mean the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the hertz and shall be specified. 
    Impulse noise means a noise of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. 
    Industrial area means an area located within a business park zoning district (BP), light industrial zoning district (LI) or general industrial zoning district (GI) pursuant to the town land development code. 
    Microbar means a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is equal to one dyne per square centimeter. 
    Motor vehicles means any self-propelled device in, upon, or by which any person or property is, or may be, transported within the town, including but not limited to, licensed or unlicensed vehicles, automobiles, motor boats, personal water craft, minibikes, go-carts, motorized skateboards, and motorcycles. 
    Non-residential area shall include any area located within a commercial area, industrial area or other area not zoned as a single family residential zoning district or multi-family residential zoning district pursuant to the town land development code. 
    Period of a periodic quantity shall mean the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself. 
    Periodic quantity means oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time. 
    Person means an individual, firm, association, partnership, joint venture or corporation. For the purpose of section 42-64, person shall also include an owner of property, tenant, lessee, manager, agent, or other person entitled to lawfully possess (or who claims lawful possession of such property) at the time of the offense. 
    Pure tone noise means any noise that is distinctly audible as a single pitch (frequency) or set of pitches as determined by the enforcement officer. 
    Residential area means an area located within a single family residential or multi-family residential zoning district pursuant to the town land development code. 
    Sound level (noise level) in decibels (dB) is the sound measured with the a-weighting and slow response by a sound level meter. 
    Sound level meter means an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks used to measure sound levels which satisfies the pertinent requirements in American National Standard Specifications for Sound Level Meters S1.4-1971 or the most recent revision thereof. 
(c)  Exemptions. The following uses and activities shall be exempt from noise level regulations in this section, but may be subject to other town regulations, including but not limited to the regulations in the Land Development Code:

It is a game of high-tech hide-and-seek sharing many aspects with benchmarking, trig pointing, orienteering, treasure-hunting, letterboxing and way marking. 
    Riparian preserve means riparian preserve at Water Ranch, the riparian sanctuary at Neely Ranch and the preserve at Sonoqui Wash.

    Virtual geocaching. Virtual geocaching, though like geocaching, involves no tangible artifacts, only discovering a location rather than a container, such as is demonstrated with activities such as waymarking and earthcaching.

Sec. 58-370. - Recordkeeping: claim of exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit; documentation; liability. 
(a)  All deductions, exclusions, exemptions and credits provided in this Chapter are conditional upon adequate proof and documentation of such as may be required under A.R.S. Section 42-5022 or by this Chapter or Regulation. 
(b)  Any person who claims and receives an exemption, deduction, exclusion, or credit to which he is not entitled under this Chapter, shall be subject to, liable for, and pay the tax on the transaction as if the vendor subject to the tax had passed the burden of the payment of the tax to the person wrongfully claiming the exemption. A person who wrongfully claimed such exemption shall be treated as if he is delinquent in the payment of the tax and shall be subject to interest and penalties upon such delinquency. However, if the tax is collected from the vendor on such transaction it shall not again be collected from the person claiming the exemption, or if collected from the person claiming the exemption it shall not also be collected from the vendor. 
( Ord. No. 2522, § I(Att.) , 2-19-15) 
Sec. 58-372. - Proof of exemption: sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or license of rental equipment. 
    A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License number, and makes a verbal claim of "sale for resale or lease" or "lease for re-lease" does not meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The "reasonable evidence" must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business. Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions. 
( Ord. No. 2522, § I(Att.) , 2-19-15) 
Sec. 58-380. - Inadequate or unsuitable records.

Sec. 58-570. - Administrative review; petition for hearing or for redetermination; finality of order. (Local Audits) 
    For the purposes of this section, "Municipal Tax Hearing Office" means the administrative offices of the Municipal Tax Hearing Officer. 
(a)  Informal Conference. A taxpayer shall have the right to discuss any proposed assessment with the auditor prior to the issuance of any assessment, but any such informal conference is not required for the taxpayer to file a petition for administrative review. 
(b)  Administrative Review. 
(1)  Filing a Petition. Other than in the case of a jeopardy assessment, a taxpayer may contest the applicability or amount of tax, penalty, or interest imposed upon or paid by him pursuant to this Chapter by filing a petition for a hearing or for redetermination with the Tax Collector as set forth below: 
(A)  within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the taxpayer of notice of a determination by the Tax Collector that a tax, penalty, or interest amount is due, or that a request for refund or credit has been denied; or 
(B)  by voluntary payment of any contested amount when accompanied by a timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of the protested portion of said payment; or 
(C)  by petition accompanying a timely filed return contesting an amount reported but not paid; or 
(D)  by petition requesting review of denial of waiver of penalty as provided in subsection 58-540(g). 
(2)  Extension to file a petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may request an extension from the Tax Collector. Such request must be in writing, state the reasons for the requested delay, and must be filed with the Tax Collector within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition. The Tax Collector shall allow a forty-five (45) day extension to file a petition, when such written request has been properly and timely made by the taxpayer. The Tax Collector may grant an additional extension and may determine the corresponding time of any such extension at this sole discretion. 
(3)  Requirements for petition. 
(A)  The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the amount of reduction or refund requested. The petition may be amended at any time prior to the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such time as the Hearing Officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of redeterminations without hearings. The Hearing Officer may require that amendments be in writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable period of time to file the amendment. The Hearing Officer shall provide a reasonable period of time for the Tax Collector to review and respond to the petition and to any written amendments. 
(B)  The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a hearing which shall be granted by the Hearing Officer. If no request for hearing is made the petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision by the Hearing Officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any reply made by the Tax Collector. 
(C)  The provisions of this Section are exclusive, and no petition seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered unless the petition is timely and properly filed under the Section. 
(4)  Transmittal to Hearing Officer. The city/town shall designate a Hearing Officer, who may be other than an employee of the (city/town). The Tax Collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to the Municipal Tax Hearing Officer within twenty (20) days after receipt, accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the Hearing Officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper form, he shall notify both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector; and in cases of petitions not in proper form only, the Hearing Officer shall provide the taxpayer with an extension up to forty-five (45) days to correct the petition. 
(5)  Hearings shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer and shall be continuous until the Hearing Officer closes the record. The taxpayer may be heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. Hearings shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and presentation of evidence. The Hearing Officer shall admit evidence over hearsay objections where the offered evidence has substantial probative value and reliability. Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the ordinary course of business may be admitted, without objection as to foundation, but subject to argument as to weight, admissibility, and authenticity. Summary accounting records may be admitted subject to satisfactory proof of the reliability of the summaries. In all cases, the decision of the Hearing Officer shall be made solely upon substantial and reliable evidence. All expenses incurred in the hearing shall be paid by the party incurring the same. 
(6)  Redeterminations upon a "petition for redetermination" shall follow the same conditions, except that no oral hearing shall be held. 
(7)  Hearing Ruling. In either case, the Hearing Officer shall issue his ruling not later than forty-five (45) days after the close of the record by the Hearing Officer. 
(8)  Notice of Refund or Adjusted Assessment. Within sixty (60) days of the issuance of the Hearing Officer's decision, the Tax Collector shall issue to the taxpayer either a notice of refund or an adjusted assessment recalculated to conform to the Hearing Officer's decision. 
(c)  Stipulations that future tax is also protested. A taxpayer may enter into a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature are also at issue in any protest or appeal. However, unless such stipulation is made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely and exclusively with the tax specifically protested and no other. When a taxpayer enters into such a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or court case, it is the burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and keep record of such income or protested taxable amount in his books and records in the same manner as the taxpayer is required to segregate exempt income. 
(d)  When an assessment is final. 
(1)  If a request for administrative review and petition for hearing or redetermination of an assessment made by the Tax Collector is not filed within the period required by subsection (b) above, such person shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount determined to be due and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due shall be final as provided in subsections 58-545(a) and 58-555(f). 
(2)  The decision made by the Hearing Officer upon administrative review by hearing or redetermination shall become final thirty (30) days after the taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment required by subsection (b)(8) above, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or decision in the manner provided in Section 58-575. 
(e)  The provisions of the state taxpayer bill of rights (A.R.S. Section 42-2051 et. seq.) shall not apply. 
(Tax Code 1995, § 15-570; Ord. No. 1006, § 21, 11-19-96; Ord. No. 1412, § I, 9-3-02; Ord. No. 2468, Att.(§ XV), 12-19-13)) 
Sec. 58-571. - Jeopardy assessments. (State Administration and Audits) 
(a)  If the Tax Collector believes that collection of any amounts imposed by this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall issue notice to the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111. 
(b)  In cases where such jeopardy notice has been issued, the taxpayer must meet the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1111, concerning appeals of jeopardy assessments, before any request for administrative review shall be honored. Any bond or collateral that may be required shall meet the provisions of A.R.S. Section 42-1102.

Sec. 58-571. - Jeopardy assessments. (Local Audits) 
(a)  If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any assessment or deficiency of any amounts imposed by this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall deliver to the taxpayer a notice of such finding and demand immediate payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy, including interest, penalties, and additions. 
(b)  Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the Tax Collector may immediately begin proceedings for collection. The taxpayer, however, may stay collection by filing, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the Tax Collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the town in the amount Tax Collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice. 
(c)  " Bond or Collateral ", as required by this Section, 
(1)  shall mean either: 
(A)  a bond issued in favor of the town by a surety company authorized to transact business in this State and approved by the Director of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, or 
(B)  collateral composed of securities or cash which are deposited with, and kept in the custody of, the Tax Collector. 
(2)  shall be of such form that it may, at any time without notice, be applied to any tax, penalties, or interest due and payable for the purposes of this Chapter. Securities held as collateral by the Tax Collector must be of a nature that they may be sold at public or private sale without notice to the taxpayer. 
(d)  If bond or collateral is not filed within the period prescribed by subsection (b) above, the tax collector may treat the assessment as final for purposes of any collection proceedings. The taxpayer nevertheless shall be afforded the appeal rights provided in Sections 58-570 and 58-575. The filing of a petition by the taxpayer under Section 58-570, however, shall not stay the tax collector's rights to pursue any collection proceedings. 
(e)  If the taxpayer timely files sufficient bond or collateral, the jeopardy requirements are deemed satisfied, and the taxpayer may avail himself of the provisions of Section 58-570, including requests for additional time to file a petition.

Sec. 58-572. - Expedited review of jeopardy assessments. (Local Audits) 
(a)  Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the Tax Collector furnishes the written notice required by Section 58-571(a), the taxpayer, pursuant to Section 58-570, may request the Tax Collector to review the action taken. Within fifteen (15) days after the request for review, the Tax Collector shall determine whether both the jeopardy determination and the amount assessed are reasonable. 
(b)  Within thirty (30) days after the Tax Collector notifies the taxpayer of the determination he reached pursuant to subsection (a) above, the taxpayer may bring a civil action in the appropriate court. If the taxpayer so requests, the Town shall stipulate to an accelerated and expedited resolution of the civil action. If the court determines that either the jeopardy determination or the amount assessed is unreasonable, the court may order the Tax Collector to abate the assessment, to redetermine any part of the amount assessed or to take such other action as the court finds to be appropriate. A determination made by the court under this subsection is final except as provided in Arizona Revised Statutes Section 12-170.

(1)  the taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue. 
(2)  the taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector regarding the issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time, access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector. 
(3)  the taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the Town. 
(f)  The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the Town or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the Town to recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment. 
(g)  After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by either party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.

Sec. 58-575. - Judicial review. (Local Audits) 
(a)  A taxpayer may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action against the town in the appropriate court of this county. A taxpayer is not required to pay any tax, penalty or interest upheld by the Hearing Officer before seeking such judicial review. 
(b)  The Tax Collector may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action in the appropriate court of this county. 
(c)  An action for judicial review can not be commenced by either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of notice of any refund or assessment recalculated or reduced to conform to the Hearing Officer's decision, unless the time to commence such an action is extended in writing signed by both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector. Failure to bring the action within thirty (30) days or such other time as is agreed upon in writing shall constitute a waiver of any right to judicial review, except as provided in subsection (g) below. 
(d)  The court shall hear and determine the appeal as a trial de novo; however, the Tax Collector cannot raise in the court any grounds or basis for the assessment not asserted before the Hearing Officer. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall preclude the Tax Collector from responding to any arguments which are raised by the taxpayer in the appeal. 
(e)  The Town has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit.

(f)  The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the Town or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the Town to recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment.

(a)  A taxpayer who is a prevailing party may be reimbursed for reasonable fees and other costs related to any administrative proceeding brought by the taxpayer pursuant to Section 58-570(b). For purposes of this Section, a taxpayer is considered to be the prevailing party only if both of the following are true: 
(1)  the Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified. 
(2)  the taxpayer prevails as to the most significant issue or set of issues. 
(b)  Reimbursement under this Section may be denied if any of the following circumstances apply: 
(1)  during the course of the proceeding the taxpayer unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter. 
(2)  the reason that the taxpayer prevailed is due to an intervening change in the applicable law. 
(c)  The taxpayer shall present an itemization of the reasonable fees and other costs to the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer within thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of a notice of refund or recalculated assessment issued by the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 58-570(b)(8). The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer shall determine the validity of the fees and other costs within thirty (30) days after receiving the itemization. The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision is considered a final decision.

(e)  Reimbursement to a taxpayer under this Section shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars or actual monies spent, whichever is less. The reimbursable attorney or representative fees shall not exceed one hundred dollars per hour or actual monies spent, whichever is less, unless the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or representatives for the proceeding involved justifies a higher fee.

After the notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes, penalties, interest and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above in the amounts specified therein shall be a lien on all real property of the taxpayer located in such county where recorded, and all tangible personal property of the taxpayer within the State, superior to all other liens and assessments recorded or filed subsequent to the recording or filing of the notice and claim of lien.

Sec. 58-595. - Collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation of business. 
(a)  In addition to any remedy provided elsewhere in this Town Code that may apply, the Tax Collector may apply the provisions of subsections (b) through (d) below concerning the collection of taxes when there is succession in and/or cessation of business. 
(b)  The taxes imposed by this Chapter are a lien on the property of any person subject to this Chapter who sells his business or stock of goods, or quits his business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of the tax within fifteen (15) days after selling or quitting his business. 
(c)  Any person who purchases, or who acquires by foreclosure, by sale under trust deed or warranty deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by any other method, improved real property or a portion of improved real property for which the Privilege Tax imposed by this Chapter has not been paid shall be responsible for payment of such tax as a speculative builder or owner builder, as provided in Sections 58-416 and 58-417. 
(1)  Any person who is a creditor or an affiliate of creditor, who acquires improved real property directly or indirectly from the creditor's debtor by any means set forth in this subsection, shall pay the tax based on the amount received by the creditor or its affiliate in a subsequent sale of such improved real property to a party unrelated to the creditor, regardless of when such subsequent sale takes place. Such tax shall be due in the month following the month in which the sale of the improved real property by the creditor or its affiliate occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the real property meets the definition of partially improved residential real property in Section 58-416(a)(4) and all of the requirements of Section 58-416(b)(4) are met by the parties to the subsequent sale transaction, then the tax shall not apply to the subsequent sale. 
(2)  In the event a creditor or its affiliate uses the acquired improved real property for any business purpose, other than operating the property in the manner in which it was operated, or was intended to be operated, before the acquisition or in any other manner unrelated to selling the property, the tax shall be due. The gross income upon which the tax shall be determined pursuant to Sections 58-416 and 58-417 shall be the fair market value of the improved real property as of the date of acquisition. The tax shall be due in the month following the month in which such first business use occurs. When applicable, the credit bid shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the property as of the date of acquisition. 
(3)  Once the subsequent sale by the creditor or its affiliate has occurred and the creditor or its affiliate has paid the tax due from it pursuant to this subsection, neither the creditor nor its affiliate, nor any future owner, shall be liable for any outstanding tax, penalties or interest that may continue to be due from the debtor based on the transfer from the debtor to the creditor or its affiliate. 
(4)  If the tax liability imposed by either Section 58-416 or Section 58-417 on the transfer of the improved real property to the creditor or its affiliate, or any part thereof, is paid to the Tax Collector by the debtor subsequent to payment of the tax by the creditor or its affiliate, the amount so paid may constitute a credit, as equitably determined by the Tax Collector in good faith, against the tax imposed on the creditor or its affiliate by either paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, if a creditor or its affiliate is subject to tax as described in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection and such creditor or affiliate has not previously been required to be licensed, such creditor or affiliate shall become licensed no later than the date on which the tax is due. 
(d)  A person's successors or assignees shall withhold from the purchase money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be paid, and interest or penalties due and payable, until the former owner produces a receipt from the Tax Collector showing that all town tax has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the Tax Collector. The Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate within fifteen (15) days by either providing the certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued. 
(1)  If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not constitute a liability against a buyer who has received a certificate from the Tax Collector. 
(2)  If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to obtain a certificate as provided by this Section, he is personally liable for payment of the amount of taxes required to be paid by the former owner on account of the business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued by the former owner or assignees.

The Tax Collector may require a taxpayer who requests an installment payment agreement to complete a financial report in such form and manner as the Tax Collector may prescribe. 
(b)  The Tax Collector, without notice, may alter, modify or terminate an installment payment agreement if the taxpayer:

REGULATIONS-PRIVILEGE AND EXCISE TAXES 

Reg. 58-100.1. - Brokers. 
(a)  For the purposes of proper administration of this Chapter and to prevent evasion of taxes imposed, brokers shall be wherever necessary treated as taxpayers for all purposes, and shall file a return and remit the tax imposed on the activity on behalf of the principal. No deduction shall be allowed for any commissions or fees retained by such broker, except as provided in Section 58-405, relating to advertising commissions. 
(b)  Brokers for vendors . A broker acting for a seller, lessor, or other similar person deriving gross income in a category upon which this Chapter imposes a tax shall be liable for such tax, even if his principal would not be subject to the tax if he conducted such activity in his own behalf, by reason of the activity being deemed a "casual" one. For example: 
(1)  An auctioneer or other sales agent of tangible personal property is subject to the tax imposed upon retail sales, even if such sales would be deemed "casual" if his principal had sold such items himself. 
(2)  A property manager is subject to the tax imposed upon rental, leasing, or licensing of real property, even if such rental, leasing, or licensing would be deemed "casual" if his principal managed such real property himself. 
(c)  Brokers for vendees . A broker acting solely for a buyer, lessee, tenant, or other similar person who is a party to a transaction which may be subject to the tax, shall be liable for such tax and for filing a return in connection with such tax only to the extent his principal is subject to the tax. 
(d)  The liability of a broker does not relieve the principal of liability except upon presentation to the Tax Collector of proof of payment of the tax, and only to the extent of the correct payment. The broker shall be relieved of the responsibility to file and pay taxes upon the filing and correct payment of such taxes by the principal. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Location of Business . Retail sales by brokers acting for another person shall be deemed to have occurred at the regular business location of the broker, in a manner similar to that used to determine "out-of-Town sales"; provided, however, that an auctioneer is deemed to be engaged in business at the site of each auction. 
(Tax Code 1995, Reg. 15-100.1) 
Reg. 58-100.2. - Delivery, installation, or other direct customer services. 
(a)  " Delivery Charges " exist only when the total charges to the ultimate customer or consumer include, as separately charged to the ultimate customer, charges for delivery to the ultimate consumer, whether the place of delivery is within or without the Town, and when the taxpayer's books and records show the separate delivery charges. 
(1)  Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed price has "delivery included" or other similar expression is insufficient to show the delivery as a separate charge. Only the separately stated charge for the delivery shall be deemed a "delivery charge". 
(2)  Freight in . Charges for delivery from place of production or the manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of wholesalers or jobbers or other middlemen are deemed "freight-in" and are not considered delivery. 
(b)  " Installation ", as used in this definition, relates only to tangible personal property. Installation to real property is deemed construction contracting in this Chapter. Examples of installation relating to tangible personal property are: installing a radio in an automobile; applying sun screens on the windows of a boat; installing cabinets, carpeting, or "built-in appliances" to a camper or motorized recreational vehicle. 
(c)  Repair of tangible personal property is not included in this definition. See Regulation 58-465.1. 
(d)  " Direct Customer Services " means services other than repair rendered directly to the customer. Services or labor provided by any person prior to the transfer of tangible personal property to the customer or consumer are not included in this definition. In the following examples, the requirements of subsection (e) below are referred to by the words "identify" or "identification." 
(1)  A retailer sells a customer a $100 "plug-in" appliance, with a $25 delivery and installation charge. If the retailer identifies the $25 delivery and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services. 
(2)  A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink served, $300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and waiters. If all charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set up and cleanup is a charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food and service is restauranting gross income. 
(3)  Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or persons engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such charges for labor as direct customer services. 
(4)  All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a photograph (sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching, etc.) for services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property are not direct customer services. 
(5)  An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may consider such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if such charge is properly identified. 
(6)  Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the production of any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry, artwork, tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as such labor occurs prior to the transfer of property. 
(e)  Recordkeeping requirements . 
(1)  Any person who engages in transactions involving these services must: 
(A)  Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for such services in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily identify the specific dollar amount of the service charge; and 
(B)  Maintain business books and records in a manner in which the separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector. 
(2)  Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction involving such services and the transfer of tangible personal property which only indicates the total amount of the charges with words such as "services included" or "charge includes labor and parts" or similar a expression does not satisfy the requirements of this subsection. 
(Tax Code 1995, Reg. 15-100.2)

    When in the opinion of the Tax Collector it is necessary for efficient administration of this Chapter, he may regard any salesman, representative, peddler, canvasser, or agent of any dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer under whom he operates or from whom he obtains tangible personal property for sale, rental, lease, or license as a retailer for the purposes of this Chapter, irrespective of whether he is making sales, rentals, leases, or licenses on his own behalf or on behalf of others. The Tax Collector may also regard such dealer, distributor, supervisor, or employer as a retailer for the purposes of this Chapter.

In addition to the foregoing, a lease with option to purchase a single residential unit shall be considered a "sale" at the date of execution of such lease if said option is exercisable by the lessee in not later than nine (9) months. Further in the case of cooperative apartments, the sale date shall be the date of execution of the contract selling (subject or not to encumbrances, liens or security interests) of a share, or a sufficient number of shares which entitle the purchaser to the occupancy of a residential unit.

For example, opinion letters, workpapers, reports, etc. are not in a form which would be subject to retail sales to customers. However, transfer of items in a form which would be subject to retail sales (e.g., artwork, forms, manuals, etc.) would not be considered professional services. The issue is one of fact which must be resolved in each situation. 
(b)  Creative ("idea") labor and design labor that do not result in tangible personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed professional services and, if charged separately and maintained separately in the taxpayer's books and records, are not includable in gross income.

(d)  Examples: 
(1)  The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of the services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is regarded as inconsequential to the charges for professional services. 
(2)  An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such appraiser's efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential. 
(3)  Use of a hair care product on a client's hair by a barber or beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually inconsequential.

(e)  The sale of labels to a purchaser who affixes them to a primary container is a sale for resale and not taxable. Directional or instructional material included with products sold are considered to be part of the product and a sale for resale.

(a)  Any person who interferes with the officers or agents of the town in the discharge of their duties under this chapter, or who digs up or causes to be dug up any sidewalk, street or alley for the purpose of connecting with the potable water, irrigation, effluent delivery, or sewer systems of the town without first obtaining a permit from the building official to do so, or who, having such a permit, digs up or causes to be dug up any portion of any sidewalk, street or alley for the purpose of connecting with the potable water, irrigation, effluent delivery or sewer systems and fails to replace the sidewalk, street or alley in its original condition, or who violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a class one misdemeanor. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly to do any of the following: 
(1)  Tamper, as that term is defined in A.R.S. § 13-3724(e), with property that is owned or used by the town to provide utility service. 
(2)  Make a connection or reconnection with property that is owned or used by the town to provide utility service without the authorization or consent of the town. 
(3)  Prevent a utility meter or other device that is used to determine the charge for utility services from accurately performing its measuring function. 
(4)  Divert or cause to be diverted utility services by any means or use, receive or otherwise divert utility services without the authorization of the town if the customer or person knows or has reason to know of the unlawful diversion, tampering or connection. 
(c)  There is a rebuttable presumption that the customer in whose name the service is provided or person who receives such service intentionally violated this section if any of the following occurs: 
(1)  An instrument, apparatus or device that was installed to obtain utility service without paying the full charge is found attached to the meter or other device that is used to provide the utility service on the premises controlled by the customer or by the person who uses or receives the utility service; or 
(2)  A meter was altered, tampered with or bypassed resulting in an inaccurate measurement of utility services; or 
(3)  The customer, person or owner is an occupant of the premises, or has an access to the system for delivery of the service to the premises and receives a benefit from tampered or bypassed equipment. 
This presumption shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence but does not shift the burden of proof to the defendant. 
(d)  No person shall obstruct or place upon or about any utility appliance or fixture including, but not limited to, any valve, valve box, curb cock, meter box, or water gate connected with the potable water, irrigation, effluent delivery or sewer systems of the town or any object, material, debris or structure of any kind that shall prevent free access to the same at all times or in any manner tamper with or injure such appurtenances. No person shall fill up or cover over any valve or meter box. The town may physically remove, tow or otherwise relocate any obstructions to public utility facilities at the customer's, owner's or occupant's expense. 
(e)  Any person who violates subsections (b) or (d) by tampering with, obstructing or otherwise breaking, destroying or damaging a water meter, or who by-passes, disconnects or diverts water around a meter to avoid charges associated with his/her water usage shall pay: (1) a $100.00 tampering fee for each occurrence for each day the violation continues; and (2) the reasonable cost of the water used during the period the tampering or obstruction occurred. For purposes of this section, "reasonable cost" shall be calculated using either the average water usage costs billed to the customer or prior user in the three months prior to the occurrence of the tampering or obstruction, an estimate of the amount of water used by similar or comparable users or structures located elsewhere in the town, or any other credible evidence of the person's use of water during the period of such tampering. 
(f)  Any violation shall be corrected by the town and the costs incurred for such correction shall be assessed to the customer, owner or occupant for correcting such violations. All such costs shall be billed on the next water statement and become due and payable on that statement's due date unless a request for a hearing is filed with the town to dispute the charges. If service had been previously terminated pursuant to this Code, service shall remain terminated until all associated costs are paid in full. 
(g)  In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (e) above, the town may discontinue, suspend or refuse service to any consumer or other person who tampers with, obstructs the potable water, irrigation, effluent delivery or sewer systems of the town, or who otherwise willfully disregards the provisions of the utility services contract or this chapter, commits fraud or abuse. 
(h)  The town may further discontinue, suspend or refuse utility service for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  As a result of emergency repair, insufficient supply, legal process, strike, riot, fire, flood, accident or any unavoidable cause. 
(2)  An unauthorized turn-on. 
(3)  The failure of the customer or the property owner to meet any of the conditions for initiating, continuing or reestablishing service set forth in section 66-6. 
(4)  At the direction of the council. 
(i)  Before any discontinuation, supension or refusal of utility service takes effect, the town shall notify the person in whose name the service is provided in writing of the violation and the date such service shall cease. The written notification shall also provide for an opportunity to meet with the town prior to the cessation of such service. 
(j)  Any person who wishes to permanently discontinue a utility service shall provide advance notice to the town of the intended termination of the utility service. The notice shall include the customer's name, service location, account number, and the proposed termination date, and shall not be deemed given unless in writing and received by the finance manager. The finance manager may establish in writing an alternative notice procedure such as telephonic or electronic notice. If termination of the utility service would violate this chapter, the customer shall be so notified and the utility service shall not be discontinued.

Sec. 66-173. - Sewer use fees, charges and loading surcharges. 
(a)  Sewer use charges. 
(1)  If a user discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the town sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be shown by such party, to the satisfaction of the director, that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter the sewer system, then the director may determine in such manner and by such method as he may find practicable, the percentage of metered water entering the sewer system. The quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be that percentage so determined of the water measured by the water meters, or the director may require or permit the installation of acceptable additional water or sewer meters, at such party's expense, and in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system, in which case the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system, as determined. If such additional water or sewer meters are installed, an additional charge of $5.00 shall be made to cover the cost of reading and computing the flow of each such meter, and such additional charge shall be added to each sewer charge bill rendered. 
(2)  After installation of the measuring equipment approved by the director, it shall be the obligation of each industrial user to conduct a test on such measuring equipment at least once every 12 months to determine its accuracy, and the results thereof shall be furnished in writing to the director. Those users seeking renewal of an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall file the results as part of the report required by section 66-175. It shall also be the industrial user's responsibility to notify the department of public works within a reasonable time in advance so that the department may, if it chooses, have a witness present during such test. If, upon any such test, the percentage of accuracy is found to be within the accuracy tolerance as established by the manufacturer's specifications, such measuring equipment shall be determined to have correctly measured the quantity delivered to the sewer system. If, however, upon any such test, the percentage of accuracy is found to be in excess of the accuracy tolerance specified in the manufacturer's specifications, then such measuring equipment shall be immediately adjusted to register correctly the quantity delivered to the sewer system. The billings to such industrial user shall be adjusted for a period extending back to the time when the inaccuracy began, if such time is ascertainable, or for a period extending back one-half of the time elapsed since the date of the last test or the date of the last adjustment, if the time is not ascertainable. 
(3)  All users for which the water supply is from other suppliers of water shall furnish to the town either a certified meter reading of water delivered to its plant or company, or a copy of the billing from the water supplier. In this event, the user's charges will be calculated and the time conditions will apply as if the town were the supplier of water to the user. 
(b)  Commercial and industrial sewer use surcharge. If the director determines that a commercial or industrial sewer user imposes an increased operating demand on the wastewater treatment plant, then the user shall pay a loading surcharge based on such increased operating demand, regardless of the pollutant involved. The loading surcharge shall be in addition to the sewer rate established pursuant to subsection (a) above.

(b)  Enforcement action. The director may take enforcement action for noncompliance with any of the requirements, conditions, limitations, or restrictions in this article, or as made part of a permit. These enforcement actions may include any or all of the following: 
(1)  Informal notice . A phone call, letter, or inspection report may be used to notify the user of a less significant violation. An informal notice also may be used to seek an explanation, request the exercise of more due care, and/or notify the user that subsequent violations of the same type will be dealt with more severely. 
(2)  Notice of violation (NOV). When the director determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, an industrial agreement, an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue the user a written NOV. The NOV requires an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of future violations. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a NOV. 
(3)  Temporary increase in self-monitoring (TISM). When an effluent limit violation has occurred, the director may require the user to increase its sampling requirements for the specific parameter(s) violated for a specified time period. This is in addition to any federal resampling requirements. 
(4)  Review meeting. The director may hold a review meeting with the user if enforcement actions do not bring the user back into compliance. The purpose of this meeting is to stress the importance of correcting situations that may lead to significant noncompliance, or to other elevated enforcement actions. 
(5)  Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, an industrial agreement, an order issued hereunder, any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(6)  Notice to show cause. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, an industrial agreement, an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Some actions that may be taken include, but are not limited to administrative orders, cease and desist orders or civil penalties. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(7)  Administrative orders (AO) . When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a permit, an industrial agreement, an order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement may issue an administrative order that requires the user to come into compliance. The order shall include specific action(s) to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the order. Administrative orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharge to the sewer. An administrative order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does an administrative order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of an administrative order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(8)  Termination of sewer service. In addition to reasons set forth in articles I and II of this chapter, the director shall have the authority to discontinue sewer service to a user for any of the following reasons: 
a.  Failure to pay a charge assessed by the director for unauthorized discharges. 
b.  Failure to correct an unauthorized discharge as required by the director. 
c.  Discharging any unauthorized substances, materials, water, or waste as prohibited by this article or by the director. 
d.  For violation of any provision of this article. 
Before discontinuing sewer service, the director shall give written notice to the user of the discontinuance and an opportunity to show cause before the director on any disputed matter relative to the discontinuance of sewer service. The discontinuance of sewer service shall be accomplished by physically cutting and blocking the building connection. The actual cost for disconnecting and/or reconnecting the sewer service shall be paid to the wastewater section. 
(9)  Emergency suspensions. The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operations of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings of this article are initiated against the user. 
b.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
c.  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension. 
(10)  Civil penalties . The director may impose civil penalties on any user for violations of this article. Any user who violates this article shall be civilly liable to the town for a sum not to exceed $27,500.00 per day for each violation. The director shall give written notice of any civil penalties imposed upon the user and an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Civil penalties imposed for violation of this article shall be based upon the following criteria: 
a.  The seriousness of the violation; 
b.  The economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation; 
c.  Any history of such violation; 
d.  Any good faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements; 
e.  The economic impact of the penalty on the violator; and 
f.  Such other factors as justice may require. 
(11)  Suspension or revocation of permit. The director may suspend or revoke any user's permit for failure to comply with the requirements of such permit. 
(12)  Criminal or civil action. The director may request the town attorney commence criminal and/or civil action, including seeking injunctive relief, against any user violating any requirement of this article. 
(c)  Violation constitutes misdemeanor. Any violation of this article shall constitute a misdemeanor, and any such violation shall constitute a separate offense on each successive day continued. 
(d)  Liability for costs. In addition to any civil and criminal penalty, which may be imposed for violations of this article, any person shall be liable for all actual costs, which may be assessed by the director on any user of the town's sewage works who discharges wastes containing nonpermissible quantities of prohibited substances into the public sewer system. The director is authorized to assess charges based on the extra costs incurred by the town in surveillance, sampling and testing of the discharges, for additional operating and maintenance expenses, and for any other action required to identify, handle, process or supplement normal activities due to the unauthorized discharge of wastes, including overhead charges. 
(e)  Notice of final determination; payment of fees. Upon notice of the final determination by the director of an assessment owing or order to correct an unauthorized discharge, the responsible party shall tender the fee assessed within ten days of the date ordered and discontinue the unauthorized discharge as ordered by the director. If the unauthorized discharge is not corrected or the assessment is not tendered, it is hereby declared to be, and is, a public nuisance which may be abated by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, and its continued operation is unlawful. The remedy provided in this section shall be in addition to any other remedy authorized by this article. 
(f)  Additional remedies. The imposition of a fine pursuant to this article shall not preclude the town from taking any other action necessary to recover fees, penalties, or damages due and owing and arising out of the same occurrence. 
(g)  Publication of violations. The director shall annually publish, in the largest daily newspaper published in the town, public notice of all industrial users who at least once during the prior calendar year were in significant noncompliance. The notification shall also summarize enforcement actions taken against such users during the same 12-month period. The director shall notify industrial users of applicable pretreatment standards and any applicable requirements under Section 204(b) and 405 of the Clean Water Act and Subtitles C and D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11) 
Sec. 66-179. - Inspections. 
(a)  Inspections. the director is authorized to inspect any facility or premises that connect to the town's POTW to ensure compliance with this article. 
(b)  Facilities. Commercial and industrial users shall provide the town access to all facilities including, but not limited to, sewers, sewage pumping plants, pollution control plants, all industrial processes, industrial wastewater generation, conveyance and pretreatment facilities, devices and connecting sewers, and all similar sewage facilities. Access shall also be granted to all parts of the premises, including but not limited to monitoring areas, chemical and raw material storage areas, and record storage areas for the purposes of inspections, sampling and record examination, copying, and the performance of any additional duties may be made to determine that such facilities are maintained and operated properly and are adequate to meet the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Access. Free access to all of the facilities or to other facilities directly or indirectly connected to the town's sewage systems shall be given to authorized personnel of the town, at all reasonable times, including those occasioned by emergency conditions. Any permanent or temporary obstruction to free access to the sewage facility to be inspected shall promptly be removed by the facility user or owner at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. 
(d)  Interference with inspection. No person shall interfere with, delay, resist, or refuse entrance to an authorized town inspector attempting to inspect any wastewater generation, conveyance, or treatment facility connected directly or indirectly to the town's sewage system. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11) 
Sec. 66-180. - Sampling and flow monitoring. 
(a)  Town sampling and analysis. The director may randomly sample and analyze effluent from commercial and industrial users, conduct surveillance and inspection activities in order to independently identify occasional and continuing noncompliance with pretreatment standards, and may inspect and sample effluent from each permitted user at least once a year. 
(b)  User sampling. In order to ensure a continuing compliance with the limitations and restrictions set forth in this article, the director may require a commercial or industrial user to monitor its discharge to the POTW by testing the discharge with sufficient frequency to ensure that such limitations are not exceeded and such restrictions not violated. Such testing shall be conducted pursuant to approved laboratory procedures. 
(1)  Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless the director authorizes time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling. Where the director authorizes time-proportional composite sampling or grabs sampling, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for the facility or facilities. 
(2)  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: 
a.  For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; 
b.  For volatile organic compounds and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. 
(3)  The director, as appropriate may authorize composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies. 
(4)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. 
(5)  For sampling required by the permit, the director shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(6)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by or other parties approved by EPA. 
(7)  All pollutant analyses required to be submitted as part of a permit application or report shall be performed by an environmental laboratory licensed by the state pursuant to A.R.S. Tit. 36, Ch. 4.3 (A.R.S. § 36-495 et seq.). 
(8)  If the results of a permittee's self-monitoring wastewater analysis indicate a violation has occurred, the user shall inform the director of the violation within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation or possible violation. The user shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit in writing the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, unless the director requires it sooner. 
(9)  Where the control authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the control authority must perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat analysis. Resampling is not required if: 
a.  The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency of at least once per month; or 
b.  The control authority performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the control authority receives the result of this sampling. 
(c)  User analysis. The director may require a laboratory analysis of a user's discharge at any time. Such analysis shall be performed by: 
(1)  An independent laboratory acceptable to the director; 
(2)  A town laboratory operated by the town; or 
(3)  The user itself. 
(d)  Who shall perform the analysis. The director has authority to determine who shall perform the analysis. The director may also require that all costs associated with such analysis be paid by the user. 
(e)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the director from each of the following: 
(1)  Regulated process streams; and 
(2)  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(f)  Estimated flows. The director may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where considerations are justified by cost or feasibility. 
(g)  Other methods. When the director determines that flow proportional composite sampling is not feasible, the director may allow or conduct composite sampling by time-proportional techniques or by the compositing or averaging of one or more grab samples. 
(h)  Tampering . It shall be unlawful for any person to tamper with, damage, or destroy any monitoring equipment with the knowledge or intention of altering the sampling analysis or readings or causing damage or destruction of the monitoring/sampling equipment being utilized to determine compliance with this article. 
(i)  No combining of town and non-town samples. In determining compliance with the daily effluent limitation and with the monthly average, town samples shall not be combined with non-town samples. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11) 
Sec. 66-181. - Hazardous wastes discharges. 
(a)  Discharge of hazardous wastes. Each industrial user shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional wastewater management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 402.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 402.12(b), (d), and (e). 
(1)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(2)  In the case of new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(3)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable and that it has selected the method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available which minimizes the present and future threat to human health and the environment. The user shall permit access to the sampling point or sampling well to the town's representative or the independent laboratory for the purpose of obtaining a sample at any reasonable time. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11) 
Sec. 66-182. - Accidental discharges. 
(a)  Prevention. Each user shall take measures to prevent the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this article. 
(b)  Immediate notice. All commercial and industrial users shall immediately notify the director of any discharge, including any accidental discharge in violation of any categorical pretreatment standard, local limit, pretreatment requirement, prohibited discharge, best management practice, or permit condition imposed by this article. 
(c)  Written notice. Within five days of the date of occurrence the user shall submit to the director a detailed written statement describing the following: 
(1)  Causes of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrences; 
(2)  The location of the discharge, known or estimated nature, concentration and volume of the discharge pollutants; 
(3)  Type of assistance required from the town; and 
(4)  Corrective actions undertaken, being undertaken, and/or to be undertaken by the user. 
(d)  Effect of notice. Such notification will not relieve the user of liability for any expenses, loss or damage to the sanitary sewer system, or for any fines imposed on the town on account thereof, and/or for any enforcement action. 
(e)  Corrective actions. Following an occurrence any user shall initiate corrective action required by the director to prevent any further injury to human health or safety, or to the environment, the POTW, and/or any other property, promptly repair all or part of any injury or damage caused by any such discharge, and ensure such a discharge does not again occur. 
(f)  Education. Users shall make available to their employees copies of this article, together with such other wastewater information and notices, which may be furnished by the town, from time to time, for the purpose of improving and making more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and permanently posted on the users bulletin board advising officers, agents and employees who to call in case of an accidental discharge in excess of the limits authorized by the permit. 
(g)  Labeling. User is responsible for labeling any possible connection or entry point for a hazardous and/or prohibited substance to the user's plumbing or drainage system to warn operating personnel against unlawful discharges. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11) 
Sec. 66-183. - Reporting and monitoring requirements. 
(a)  Reporting requirements. Permittees shall provide the director with all self-monitoring reports and notices in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.12 including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7). At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that became categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the director a report which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7). A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. If a compliance schedule is required to meet the categorical pretreatment standards the industrial user shall submit the compliance schedule to the director which contains the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12(c)(1)-(3). 
(2)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4)-(6), on a form supplied by the director. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the director in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
(3)  Periodic reports on continued compliance. Reports must be filed by the industrial user in June and December of each year unless required more frequently by the permit. The report must contain information on the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent, which are listed in the user's permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard, or local limit, requires compliance with a BMP (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation, required by the director, or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(4)  Notice of potential problems, including slug loading. All categorical and non-categorical industrial users shall notify the POTW immediately of all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loadings, as defined by 40 CFR 403.5(b), by the industrial user. 
(b)  Monitoring and analysis to demonstrate continued compliance. The reports required in subsections (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration, or the production and mass where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. 
(1)  The sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the industrial user. Where the POTW performs the required sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the user will not be required to submit the compliance certification required. In addition, where the POTW itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow data, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report. 
(2)  The reports required in subsections (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section must be based upon data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. The director shall require that frequency of monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(3)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in subsection (a)(3) of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the director, using procedures prescribed in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(Ord. No. 2323, § I, 4-7-11)

zoning ordinances;
C. Maintain and enhance the appearance and function of both new and existing
development;

divisions, a glossary of general terms, and the Official Zoning Map:
Division 1: General Provisions
Division 2: Land Use Designations
Division 3: Overlay District Regulations
Division 4: General Regulations
Division 5: Administration
Division 6: Use Definitions
Glossary of General Terms
B. Graphic Illustrations. Illustrations are included for the purposes of example,
explanation, and clarification. Where a graphic is in conflict with the text of the
Zoning Code, the text shall govern.
1.104 Applicability
All uses and development of land shall comply with the zoning regulations of the Zoning
Code.
A. Applicability to Property. Zoning regulations shall apply to all land within the
Town of Gilbert, including land owned by the Town of Gilbert and other local,
State, or Federal agencies to the extent allowed by law.
Article 1.1: Title and Purpose
12-30-08 Chapter I, Article 1.1 - Page 3
B. Applicability to Streets and Rights-of-Way. Streets, easements, and rights-ofway
shall be in the same zoning district as contiguous property. Where
contiguous properties are in different zoning districts, the centerline of the street
shall be the district boundary unless otherwise depicted on the Official Zoning
Map.
C. Compliance with Regulations. No land shall be used and no structure shall be
constructed, occupied, enlarged, or altered in any zoning district except in
compliance with the Zoning Code.
D. Substandard Lot. As permitted in Section 4.603D: Non-Conforming or
Substandard Lot or Parcel, an existing, legally created lot as of the effective date
of the Zoning Code having a width or area less than that required for the base
district in which it is located may be occupied by a permitted use or use requiring
approval of a Use Permit. However, no substandard lot may be further reduced in
area or width and no substandard lot will be exempt from the setback
requirements of the district. A substandard lot shall be considered a nonconforming
lot in accordance with Section 4.602B: Non-Conforming Lot or
Parcel.
E. Lots or Parcels Divided by District Boundaries. The regulations applicable to
each district shall be applied to the entire area within that district, and no use other
than parking serving a principal use on the lot or parcel may be located in a
district in which it is not a permitted use or use approved by a Use Permit.
F. Public Nuisance. Neither the provisions of the Zoning Code nor the approval of
any permit authorized by the Zoning Code shall authorize the maintenance of any
public nuisance.
G. Conflict with Other Regulations. Where there is a conflict between the
provisions of the Zoning Code, or between the provisions of the Zoning Code and
any other Town code, the more restrictive provision shall control unless otherwise
set forth in the Zoning Code. The modifications to base district zoning
regulations contained in an approved Planned Area Development Overlay
district are not amended by amendments to the Zoning Code.
H. Relation to Prior Zoning Code. No provision of the Zoning Code shall validate
any use or structure established, constructed, or maintained in violation of any
prior zoning code, except as may be specifically authorized by the Zoning Code.
I. Extension of Time for Holidays and Weekends. If a deadline for an act required
by the Zoning Code falls on a weekend or a Town holiday, the time for
performing such an act shall be extended to the next working day.

Note (1) The following fair disclosure agreement and covenant, which would include the
following disclosure, shall be recorded as a condition of development approval: This
property, due to its proximity to Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, will experience
aircraft overflights, which are expected to generate noise levels that may be of concern
to some individuals. The mix of aviation activities and types of aircraft expected to be
located and operate at the Airport now and in the future include: scheduled and
unscheduled commercial charters, commercial air carriers and commercial air cargo
operations, all of which are expected to use large commercial aircraft; general aviation
activity using corporate and executive jets, helicopters, and propeller aircraft; aviation
flight training schools using training aircraft; and military activity using high
performance military jets. The size of aircraft and frequency of use of such aircraft may
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 3-21-19 Chapter I, Article 3.2 Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Overlay District Page 5
change over time depending on market and technology changes.
Note (2) All final subdivision plats and public reports filed with the Arizona Department of Real
Estate shall include the notice described in Note 1.
Note (3) Sales and leasing offices established for new subdivisions and residential development
projects shall provide notice to all prospective buyers and lessees stating that the project
is located within an Aircraft Overflight Area. Such notice shall consist of a sign at least
4-foot by 4-foot installed at the entrance to the sales or leasing office at each project.
The sign shall be installed prior to commencement of sales or leases and shall not be
removed until the sales office is permanently closed or leasing office no longer leases
units in the project. The sign should state the disclosure in Note 1 with letters of at least
one (1) inch in height.
Note (4) An avigation easement shall be recorded concurrently with or prior to the recordation of
a subdivision plat or issuance of a building permit holding the Town, the public, and the
Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Authority harmless from any damages caused by noise,
vibration, fumes, dust, fuel, fuel particles, or any other effects that may be caused by
aircraft landing, departing or operating at or near a designated Airport, not including the
physical impact of aircraft or parts thereof.
Note (5) The developer should incorporate features into the design and construction of buildings
where people live, work, or are otherwise received to achieve an outdoor-to indoor noise
level reduction of 25 decibels.
Note (6) Hazardous Materials and Airspace Protection Policies (Reference Section 3.203A):
a. Facilities with aboveground storage tanks containing any of the following
materials:
(1) Flammable or combustible liquids, including fuels or other substances
containing at least 5 percent petroleum, with individual tanks having a
capacity greater than 6,000 gallons or total tank capacities greater than
12,000 gallons.
(2) Liquefied petroleum, hydrogen and natural gases and cryogenic liquids
with an individual tank capacity equivalent to 2,000 gallons of water or
total tank capacities greater than the equivalent of 30,000 gallons of
water.
(3) Compressed gases in excess of 50,000 cubic feet on the premises.
b. Facilities involving the manufacturing, processing, warehousing, or storage of
toxic substances exceeding the threshold planning quantities for hazardous and
extremely hazardous substances specified by the EPA.
c. Facilities involving the manufacturing, processing, warehousing, or storage of
explosive materials, including fireworks, in quantities exceeding 50 pounds of
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 3-21-19 Chapter I, Article 3.2 Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Overlay District Page 6
net explosive weight
d. Medical and biological research facilities manufacturing, processing,
warehousing, or storing toxic or infectious agents that are classified as
Biosafety Level 2, 3, and 4 facilities by the US Department of Environmental
Protection (EPA).
Note (7) Bird Attractants
a. Coordination should be taken to address and mitigate as needed the potential
for bird attractants as described in Section 3.203A.
A. Airspace Protection Policies. The airspace protection policies are intended to ensure
compliance with federal law, as described in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations 14
CFR Part 77, Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace. Any of
these hazards within the 14 CFR Part 77 require FAA review. Potential Hazards outside
of the 14 CFR Part 77 should be coordinated with the FAA to ensure safety.
1. Height. The erection of objects determined by the FAA to be a hazard to air
navigation (i.e. proposed construction or alteration, for which the FAA has issued a
Determination of Hazard (DOH)), should not be permitted, regardless of whether
they penetrate a critical airspace surface depicted. The erection of such an object
would necessitate modifications in airspace design or flight procedures by increasing
visibility minimums or otherwise compromising the use of the Airport and the
surrounding airspace. In addition to the physical hazards to flight posed by tall
objects, other land use characteristics can interfere with the safety of flight.
2. Glint and Glare. Highly reflective materials may produce glint and glare causing
visual after-images or flash blindness in pilots and air traffic controllers, thus
compromising flight safety. Materials creating the potential for persistent afterimage
or flash blindness in pilots should be considered incompatible in AOA 1, AOA 2, and
the portion of the AOA 3 within the boundaries of the 14 CFR Part 77 horizontal and
outer approach surfaces. In the portion of AOA 3 outside the boundaries of the Part
77 horizontal and outer approach surfaces, reflective materials are acceptable unless
the FAA has issued a Determination of Hazard (DOH) related to the use of the
proposed reflective materials. If the airport staff and the permitting agency determine
that the potential for persistent after-image or flash blindness exists, the burden of
proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed project would not
create glint or glare problems. Adequate proof can be provided in either of two ways:

Revised 3-21-19 Chapter I, Article 3.2 Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Overlay District Page 7
a. A technical study demonstrating that the proposed building materials would not
create reflections severe enough to cause after-images or flash blindness in
pilots on approach to any runway at any time of day during any time of the year.
b. If the FAA has reviewed the proposed project through the 14 CFR Part 77
OE/AAA process, the FAAs final Notice of Determination indicates no
objections to the potential glint and glare effects of the proposed project.
3. Lighting Systems. Some lighting systems may contain features that pilots may
confuse with airport identification and navigational lighting or that may compromise
the vision of pilots on approach to a runway. The following lighting systems shall be
considered incompatible in AOA 1, AOA 2, and the portion of the AOA 3 within the
boundaries of the Part 77 horizontal and outer approach surfaces if they are directed
toward the final approach paths of aircraft:
a. Search lights (including temporary searchlights for special events, etc.)
b. Stroboscopic lights
c. Laser lights
d. A linear array of sequenced flashing lights
e. Any lighting systems that produce effects mimicking airport identification
lighting, runway end identification lighting, or runway approach lighting.
In the portion of AOA 3 outside the boundaries of the Part 77 horizontal and outer
approach surfaces, these potentially problematic lighting systems are acceptable
unless the FAA has issued a Determination of Hazard (DOH) related to the proposed
lighting.
4. Dust, Smoke and Water Vapor. Land uses that would create columns of dust, steam,
water vapor, or smoke dense enough to impair pilot or air traffic controller vision and
compromise flight safety shall be considered incompatible in AOA 1, AOA 2,and in
the portion of AOA 3 within the boundaries of the Part 77 horizontal and outer
approach surfaces. If the airport staff and the permitting agency determine that a
proposed project has the potential to create a hazard the burden of proof should be on
the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed project would not create problems
severe enough to impair pilot vision or air traffic controller vision.
The FAA has reviewed the proposed project through the 14 CFR Part 77 OE/AAA
process and issued a determination indicating no objections to the proposed project
on account of dust, steam, water vapor, or smoke, that determination should be
considered adequate evidence that the project can proceed without creating this
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 3-21-19 Chapter I, Article 3.2 Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Overlay District Page 8
hazard. In the portion of AOA 3 outside the boundaries of the Part 77 horizontal and
outer approach surfaces, these potentially problematic sources of dust, smoke, and
water vapor are acceptable unless the FAA has issued a Determination of Hazard
(DOH) related to the proposed sources.
5. Thermal Hazards. Land uses that produce thermal plumes (such as power plants or
other land uses that employ smoke stacks, cooling towers, or that create thermal
exhaust), even when not a visual hazard, may interfere with aircraft control by
causing air turbulence. Land uses that produce thermal plumes with the potential to
interfere with the safe control of aircraft should be considered incompatible in AOA
1, AOA 2 and the portion of AOA 3 within the boundaries of the Part 77 horizontal
and outer approach areas. If the airport staff and the permitting agency determine
that a proposed project has the potential to cause a hazard, the burden of proof shall
be on the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed project would not create
hazardous thermal plumes. Adequate proof could be provided in either of two ways:
a. A technical study demonstrating that the proposed project would not create
thermal plumes severe enough to compromise the safe control of the smallest
aircraft expected to fly over the proposed facility.
b. If the FAA has reviewed the proposed project through the 14 CFR Part 77
OE/AAA process, the FAAs final Notice of Determination indicates no
objections to the potential thermal plume effects of the proposed project.
6. Electromagnetic Interference. Sources of electromagnetic interference with aircraft
instrumentation and ground-based radar and navigational aids shall be considered
incompatible within the Airport Planning Area (AOA-1, AOA-2, and AOA-3).
Examples or potentially problematic sources may include radio transmission
facilities, microwave transmission towers, and wind turbines. If the permitting
agency suspects that a proposed project may create the potential for electromagnetic
interference with aviation navigational or communication equipment, it should
consult with the airport staff and bring the matter to the attention of the FAA for
study. Typically, the potential for electromagnetic interference would be considered
by the FAA through the 14 CFR Part 77 OE/AAA process. If the FAA has reviewed
the proposed project, the project sponsor shall be required to comply with any
conditions or recommendations relating to the mitigation of electromagnetic
interference.
7. Bird Attractants. The following land uses, which have the potential to attract birds,
should be considered marginally within 10,000 feet of the Airports Air Operations
Area and conditionally compatible between 10,000 feet and 5 statute miles of the Air
Operations Area. Where these uses are considered to be conditionally compatible.
For both the 10,000 foot and 5 statute mile areas measures should be taken to reduce
the risk of attracting birds. For guidance, refer to Federal Aviation Administration,
Advisory Circular AC 150/5200-33B, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants on or Near
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 3-21-19 Chapter I, Article 3.2 Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Overlay District Page 9
Airports.
a. Waste Disposal Operations
b. Transfer Stations (open or partially open air) that handle waste that are not fully
enclosed or lack ventilation and air filtration systems adequate to control odors
escaping to the outdoors)
c. Composting Operations that accept food waste
d. Water Management Facilities
e. Stormwater Management Facilities (artificial ponds, including water detention,
retention, or recharge ponds, that create above-ground standing water should
be considered incompatible within 10,000 feet of the Air Operations Area
unless required by other provisions of municipal, county, or state law. Where
these facilities are necessary and must be allowed, measures should be taken to
minimize the risks of attracting birds.)
In the portion of AOA-3 within the boundaries of the CFR 14 Part 77 horizontal and outer approach
surfaces, these uses should be considered compatible only if coordination measures are taken to
minimize the risk of attracting birds. In the portion of AOA 3 outside the boundaries of the Part
77 horizontal and outer approach surfaces, waterscapes, including those intended to support
aquatic vegetation and animal life, are acceptable; projects within either the 10,000 feet or 5 statute
miles of the Air Operations Area are subject to FAA review in accordance with AC 150/5200-
33B, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants on or Near Airports. Plans for such proposed developments
such as wastewater treatment facilities and associated settling ponds, including any devices or
systems used to store, treat, recycle, or reclaim municipal sewage or liquid industrial wastes and
artificial marshes designed for wastewater treatment and wetlands mitigation projects shall be
circulated to the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport Authority for coordination with the FAA, and for
review and comment prior to development.

guidance necessary for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the
traffic stream;
C. Economic Development. To promote economic development and the value of nonresidential
properties, through sensitivity to surrounding land uses and maintaining an
attractive community appearance.

surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to
sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; to preclude signs from
conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining sites; and to minimize
the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property;
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 3
H. Reduction of Visual Clutter. To reduce visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the
proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive
size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic;
I. Zoning District Considerations. To encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the
zoning district in which they are located;

and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; to foster the
integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; to provide flexibility and
encourage variety in signage, and to relate signage to the basic principles of good design;
and to promote the use of signs that positively contribute to the aesthetics of the
community, are appropriate in scale to the surrounding buildings and landscape, and
advance the Towns goals of quality development;

to ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory
manner, and to protect the public from unsafe signs;

possible, sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a
result of their physical characteristics such as their size (area), height, number, illumination
and movement; and to protect property values by ensuring that the number of signs are in
harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area;

4.405 Sign Plans and Sign Program
A. Heritage Sign Plans. A Heritage Sign Plan shall be required for a sign proposed within the
Heritage Village Center Zoning District for single or multiple-tenant commercial or office
uses, or for a multiple-building complex for a single commercial use. The Redevelopment
Commission may approve a Heritage Sign Plan as an alternative to the requirements set
forth Section 4.409.B for the Heritage Village Center Zoning District. If requested by an
applicant, a Heritage Sign Plan may be administratively approved when the proposed plan
complies with all of the requirements set forth in Article 4.4 Sign Regulations. In no event
shall consideration for approval be based upon the message content of a sign.
1. Conditions. The Planning Manager may attach conditions, requirements, or standards
necessary to assure that the sign structure covered by the Heritage Sign Plan will not
be materially detrimental to persons or property.
2. Evaluation Criteria. Heritage Sign Plans shall be evaluated based on the following
criteria:
a. Placement. All sign structures shall be placed where they are visible and legible.
Factors to be considered include the location relative to pedestrian movement,
traffic movement and access points, site features, other structures, and
orientation relative to viewing distances and viewing angles.
b. Size. All signs shall be no larger than necessary for visibility and legibility.
Factors to be considered in determining appropriate size include topography,
volume and speed of traffic, viewing distances and angles, proximity to adjacent
uses, and placement of display. In the event that the total business Sign Area
otherwise allowed in this Article 4.4 does not provide sufficient area for
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 6
visibility and legibility for a sign, then the maximum size of Sign Area may be
increased but only as necessary to allow for visibility and legibility; however in
no event shall the foregoing allow a total business Sign Area to exceed by more
than twenty-five (25) percent any maximum area standard otherwise allowed in
this Article 4.4.
c. Design Features and Materials. Design features and materials shall be
compatible with the architecture, colors, and materials of the structures.
d. Amendments. The Planning Manager may administratively approve minor
amendments to a Heritage Sign Plan, where such changes are determined to have
little or no visual impact and are consistent with the intent of the original
approval. In approving a minor amendment, the Planning Manager shall not
base any determination on the message content of a sign.
B. Comprehensive Sign Programs. A Comprehensive Sign Program shall be required for all
projects not located within the Heritage Village Center Zoning District and consisting of
multi-tenant buildings, nonresidential complexes with multiple buildings, or large-scale
mixed-use developments.
A Comprehensive Sign Program provides design compatibility for all signs and integrates
sign design with the architecture of the buildings.
The Comprehensive Sign Program shall set forth design standards including, but not
limited to sign types, placement, size, design, colors, materials, textures, and method of
illumination, as well as provides for vehicle and pedestrian safety through directions and
way finding orientation.
If a sign subject to the Comprehensive Sign Program complies with all of the requirements
of this Article 4.4, it may be approved administratively by the Planning Manager, as set
forth in Section 5.602B.1 Administrative Design Review. In determining approval, the
Planning Manager shall not base any approval on the message content of a sign.
C. Master Sign Plans. A Master Sign Plan may be approved as an alternative to the
requirements set forth in Section 4.409.B for the uses and developments listed below:
1. Applicability. The Design Review Board may approve a Master Sign Plan for
properties not located within the Heritage Village Center Zoning District for the
following uses and developments:
a. Multiple-tenant commercial, office, or employment uses.
b. A multiple-building complex for a single commercial or employment use in a
project exceeding 40 net acres.
c. Stand-alone office/employment buildings exceeding 100,000 square feet.
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 7
d. Indoor or Outdoor Entertainment and Recreation uses.
e. Auto malls.
f. Hospitals.
g. Hotels and Commercial Lodging having at least 150 guest rooms and a Full
Service Restaurant or conference and meeting rooms.
h. Regional retail shopping malls.
2. Conditions. The Design Review Board may attach conditions, requirements, or
standards necessary to assure that the signs covered by the Master Sign Plan will not
be materially detrimental to persons or property in the vicinity. In making its
determination, the Design Review Board shall not base any condition on the message
content of a sign.
3. Evaluation Criteria. Master Sign Plans shall be evaluated based on the following
criteria:
a. Placement. All signs shall be placed where they are visible and legible. Factors
to be considered include its location relative to traffic movement and access
points, site features, other structures, and orientation relative to viewing
distances and viewing angles. Wall Signs may be approved on building walls
other than the wall of the space occupied by the tenant in commercial centers in
which some tenants have little or no visibility from the street.
b. Quantity. The number of signs that may be approved within any development
shall be sufficient to provide necessary facilitation of internal circulation of
vehicular and pedestrian traffic and way finding for safety of the occupants of
vehicles and pedestrians. Factors to be considered shall be those that impact
safety considerations such as the size of the development and the number of
development sub-areas
c. Size. All signs shall be no larger than necessary for visibility and legibility.
Factors to be considered in determining appropriate size include topography,
volume and speed of traffic, viewing distances and angles, proximity to adjacent
uses, and placement of display. In no event shall a Master Sign Plan contain a
freestanding sign that exceeds by more than fifty (50) percent any maximum
height standard permitted by this Article. Consistent with the exemptions set
forth in this Article, there shall be no limit on the amount by which a Master
Sign Plan may allow a freestanding sign to exceed the height restrictions
permitted on the site when the freestanding sign is placed or oriented so as to be
visible only internally to the development. In no event shall a Master Sign Plan
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 8
contain a wall sign that exceeds by more than twenty-five (25) percent any
maximum size (area) standard permitted by this Article. Consistent with the
exemptions set forth in this Article, there shall be no limit on the amount by
which a Master Sign Plan may allow a wall sign to exceed the size (area)
restrictions permitted on the site when the wall sign is placed or oriented so as to
be visible only internally to the development itself.
d. Design Features and Materials. Sign design themes and materials shall be
compatible with the architecture, colors, and materials of the project.
e. Development Standards. The Design Review Board may not reduce any sign
development standard to less than 50 percent of any minimum standard, nor
increase any sign development standard by more than one hundred (100) percent
of the maximum standard. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Design Review
Board shall not base any decision on the message content of a sign.
f. Amendments. The Planning Manager may administratively approve minor
amendments to a Master Sign Plan involving non-communicative activity, where
such changes are determined to have little or no visual impact and are consistent
with the intent of the original approval.
4.406 Review of Sign Applications for Permanent Signs
All applications for Permanent Signs, except for those applications subject to administrative
approval by the Planning Manager as set forth in Section 5.602B.1, Administrative Design Review,
shall be considered by the Design Review Board or, in the Heritage District Overlay Zoning
District, by the Redevelopment Commission. Approval for a Permanent Sign may be by:

B. A Master Sign Plan; or
C. A Heritage Sign Plan; or
D. A separate Administrative Design Review application approved by the Planning Manager.

Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 9

be subject to any limitation based upon the viewpoint of the message contained on
such sign or displayed on such sign structure.
2. Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, it is the policy of the Town to
regulate signs in a manner that does not favor commercial speech over noncommercial

message (copy) may occupy the entire Sign Face or any portion thereof. The Sign Face
may be changed from a commercial message to a noncommercial message or from one
noncommercial message to another non-commercial message; provided, however, that
there is no change in the size, height, setback or spacing criteria contained in this Article.
C. Administrative Interpretation and Discretionary Approval.
1. Interpretations of this Article may be made by the zoning administrator pursuant to
Section 1.109. All interpretations of this Article are to be exercised in light of the
policies, purposes and intent set forth herein.
2. Whenever a sign permit or other approval is subject to discretion, such discretion shall
not be exercised as to message content, but instead shall be directed to structural and
location factors, including, as applicable:
a. Whether the location and placement of the sign will endanger motorists;
b. Whether the sign will cover, blanket or interfere with any prominent view of a
structure or façade of historical or architectural significance;
c. Whether the sign will obstruct views of users or adjacent buildings to side yards,
front yards or open space;

Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 10
e. Whether the sign is compatible with building heights of the existing
neighborhood;
f. Whether the signs lighting or illumination system will cause hazardous or
unsafe driving conditions for motorists;
D. Consent of Legal Owner of Property. Except as required by state law, no sign may be
displayed without the consent of the legal owner of the property on which the sign is
mounted or displayed. For purposes of this policy, "owner" means the holder of the legal
title to the property and any party and person holding a present legal right to possession,
control, or use of the property.
E. Signs on Public Property. Except as required by state law or otherwise permitted by this
Article, any sign installed or placed on public property shall be deemed illegal and shall be
forfeited to the public and subject to confiscation. In addition to other remedies hereunder,
the Town shall have the right to recover from the owner or person placing such sign the
cost of removal and disposal of such sign.
F. Placement of Signs.
1. Permanent Signs shall not project into or over the public right-of- way without first

and development site that is over one-half (1/2) acre in size and is in nonresidential use, up
to three Flagpoles may be installed. For each additional acre, up to two (2) additional
flagpoles may be installed. Up to two (2) flags may be displayed per flagpole. Flagpoles
shall be depicted on Final Design Review plans or approved administratively as part of a
sign plan. Flagpoles shall not exceed one and one-half (1.5) times the allowed building
height for the district in which it is located, but in no event shall a flagpole exceed a height

Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 11
H. Flag Brackets and Stanchions. For each principal structure on a parcel, up to two flag
brackets or stanchions may be attached or placed for the display of flags.
I. Measurement of Sign Size and Height.
1. Sign Size (Sign Area). The area of a sign (Sign Area) is measured or calculated as
follows (See Appendix 1, Figures 28, for graphic illustrations):
a. Background panel signs. Sign copy that is mounted, affixed, or painted on a
background panel or area distinctively painted, textured or constructed as a
background for the sign copy, is measured as that area contained within the sum
of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or ellipses
that will enclose both the sign copy and the background.
b. Background surface signs. The area of a sign consisting of copy mounted as
individual letters or graphics against a wall, fascia, or parapet of a building
surface or another surface, that has not been painted, textured, or otherwise
altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, is measured as the
sum of the smallest rectangles, squares, triangles, parallelograms, circles or
ellipses that will enclose each word, graphic or discrete visual element in the
total sign.
c. Illuminated background signs. The area of a sign with copy mounted, affixed, or
painted on an illuminated surface or illuminated element or a building or
structure, is measured as the entire illuminated surface or illuminated element
which contains sign copy.
d. Double-faced signs. If a sign has two (2) display faces, and the interior angle
between the two (2) faces is thirty (30) degrees or less, then the Sign Area is one
(1) Sign Face only; however, if the two (2) faces are of different sizes or shapes,
then the larger is used. If the sign has two (2) display faces, and the interior angle
between the two faces is greater than thirty (30) degrees, then the Sign Area is
the sum of the areas of the two (2) faces.
e. Multi-faced signs. If a sign has three (3) or more faces, then the Sign Area is
equal to fifty (50) percent of the aggregate area of all Sign Faces. The area of
each face shall be determined according to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as
applicable.
f. Sculptural and nonplanar signs. The area of a spherical, free form, sculptural or
other nonplanar sign is fifty (50) percent of the sum of the areas, using only the
four (4) vertical sides of the smallest four-sided polyhedron which will
completely enclose the entire sign structure.
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 12
2. Measurement of Sign Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as
the vertical distance from the average finished grade of the ground below the sign
excluding any filling, berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purposes of
increasing the height of the sign, to the top edge of the highest portion of the sign. See
Appendix 1, Figures 29, for graphic illustrations. The maximum height allowed for a
freestanding sign, however, shall not include any architectural embellishment provided
the embellishment does not exceed thirty-six (36) inches at the base of the sign and
eighteen (18) inches at the top of the sign. For the purposes of this section, average
finished grade shall be considered the lower of (a) the lowest elevation where the base
of the sign meets ground level; or (b) the top of the curb of the nearest public street
adjoining the property upon which the sign is erected; or (c) the grade of the land at
the principal entrance to the lot on which the sign is located.
J. Signs Must Maintain Clearance from Utilities and Shall Not Interfere with Surface and
Underground Water or with Drainage. Signs shall maintain a minimum distance of six
(6) feet horizontal clearance and twelve (12) feet overhead clearance from electrical
conductors and from all communications equipment or lines. Signs and their supporting
structures shall maintain clearance from and noninterference with all surface and
underground facilities and conduits for water, sewage, electricity, or communications
equipment or lines. Sign placement shall not interfere with surface or underground water or
with natural or artificial drainage.
K. Signs Declared a Nuisance and Repair; Signs Presenting Immediate Peril to Public
Health or Safety. The building official may order the repair of signs declared a nuisance,
and with or without notice may cause any structurally unsafe or structurally insecure sign
to be immediately removed if the sign presents an immediate peril to the public health or
safety.
L. Tenant Sign Panel and Wall Sign Band Replacement. Replacement of a tenant sign panel
containing the same color, size, design, and style as the original on an approved sign
structure with removable panels shall not require a permit. Any tenant panel that is vacant
or missing shall be replaced within thirty (30) days.
M. Wall Sign Fascia Repair. Where a tenant has vacated a tenant or user suite, the fascia of
the accessory wall sign band shall be repaired to its surrounding texture and color within
forty-five (45) days of the panel or sign being removed.
N. Signs Shall Not Be Attached to Certain Property and Shall Not Impair Roof Access.
Signs shall not be attached to standpipes, gutters, drains or fire escapes. Signs shall not be
installed so as to impair access to a roof.
O. Bus Shelter Signage. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.404, signs in
conjunction with bus shelter facilities approved by the Town or other governmental
agencies shall be permitted. Development standards, including but not limited to Sign Face
area, height, location, etc., shall be determined in accordance with bus shelter design
requirements established by the Town Engineer.

Comprehensive Sign Program, Master Sign Plan or Heritage Sign Plan according
to the procedures set forth in Section 5.602B.1 Administrative Design Review,
which shall be based upon content neutral and objective criteria. All light sources
shall be shielded to prevent illumination trespass onto properties other than
where the light source is located. Exposed neon, tube or bulb-type illumination
is prohibited in all other zoning districts.
c. Sign Illumination.
(1) Permanent Sign on a parcel in residential use: With the exception of an

4.4017 Sign Maintenance
Maintenance of legal signs is allowed and maintenance of the same shall not require a permit. Sign
maintenance is the replacement or repair of a part or portion of a sign required by ordinary wear,
tear, or damage, with like material, color, and design. Maintenance of legal signs does not include
changing the color, size, design, or style of signs. Any sign or component of a sign which is in a
damaged or deteriorated condition and constitutes a danger or hazard to public safety shall be
promptly repaired or replaced. Surface materials and components shall be kept free of chipping,
peeling, fading, cracks, holes, buckles, warps, splinters, or rusting visible from an adjacent property
or street. Illuminated signs shall be maintained in good operating condition including prompt
removal and replacement of all defective bulbs, light emitting diodes, fluorescent tubes, neon or
other inert gas light segments, damaged or deteriorated electrical wiring, and malfunctioning
control devices and related circuitry.
4.4018 Nonconforming Signs
It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination of nonconforming signs as
expeditiously and fairly as possible is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the
prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this Article. The following provisions
shall govern nonconforming signs.
A. Non-conforming signs may receive reasonable repairs or alterations to the face, letters, and
frame.
B. If a non-conforming sign is structurally changed or is damaged by fire, lack of
maintenance, or other causes by more than 50 percent of its reproduction value, or is
temporarily or permanently removed by any means, including acts of God, then such sign
shall be rebuilt, repaired, or replaced only in conformance with the provisions of this
Article.
C. If a non-conforming sign becomes an abandoned sign, it shall be removed after notice to
the property owner, unless in the case of an abandoned sign the property owner establishes
facts sufficient to rebut the presumption of abandonment.
D. If a property or development is expanded or modified to add new signage, all
nonconforming signs shall be removed or rebuilt to comply with the provisions of this
Article.
E. Sign Faces s may be replaced on non-conforming signs.
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
Revised 11-1-18 Chapter I, Article 4.4 Sign Regulations Page 48
F. Any change to a property that adds to or changes existing signage shall be prohibited until

herein shall prevent the replacement of Sign Faces on a nonconforming sign. Nothing
herein shall require that existing signage which does not conform to the restrictions on
Cabinet Signs or raceways be brought into conformance where it is demonstrated to the
Zoning Administrator that the type of signage permitted by this Article is not structurally
feasible.
4.4019 Sign Violations

4.703 Use and Development Regulations
A. Land Use Regulations. The land use regulations for each base zoning district in
Division 2: Land Use Designations, establish the districts in which Wireless
Communication Facilities are permitted.
B. Regulations. Site development regulations are set forth in 4.703E. In addition, WCFs
are subject to the development regulations set forth in Section 4.704: Additional
Development Regulations and Chapter II: Design Standards Manual For Wireless
Communication Facilities.
C. Residential Zoning Districts. WCFs are permitted in single family and multi- family
residential zoning districts when the property is owned by:
1. The state, county, public school district, or community college district, if the
primary use of such property is a governmental use;
2. An electric utility company, if the property is used for an electric utility use; or
Revised 02-01-18 Chapter I Article 4.7 Wireless Communication Facilities Page 3
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
3. A Place of Worship use, if the primary use of such property is for worship or social
use.
D. Wireless Communication Facility Categories. Each type of WCF has been organized
into one of three categories, primarily based on the size and visual impact each type has
to its surrounding property. Each category is subject to separate application and review
processes as depicted in Table 4.703E.
1. Category 1 WCFs. Facilities in this category have minimal visual impact due to the
small size, concealment efforts, and location on existing vertical elements. The
process to review and approve Category 1 facilities is through an Administrative
Design Review. Examples of Category 1 facilities include but are not limited to
Microcells, new Small Wireless Facilities (SWFs) and WCFs on utility poles and
recreational field light poles.
2. Category 2 WCFs. Facilities in this category have a more significant visual impact
than those in Category 1 due to their larger size and new vertical elements. The
process to review and approve Category 2 facilities is through an Administrative
Use Permit. Examples of Category 2 facilities include but are not limited to new
Small Stealth Structures, existing vertical elements.
3. Category 3 WCFs. Facilities in this category have the most significant visual
impact on surrounding properties due to the increased heights permitted and fewer
requirements for concealment. The process to review and approve Category 3
facilities is through a Conditional Use Permit. Examples of Category 3 facilities
include but are not limited to Monopoles, Large Stealth Structures and Public
Safety Communication Facilities.

5.301 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this article is to authorize minor deviations from the requirements of this
Code.
The Director may grant administrative relief from development standards as authorized by
this article where such deviations are necessary for the implementation of this Code and will
improve the quality of development. Administrative relief granted pursuant to this article
may only be granted prior to construction. Such relief is not a variance.
5.302 Scope of Authority
The Director is authorized to grant administrative relief from dimensional requirements of the

minimum required to implement the purposes of the Zoning Code and improve the quality of
development.

Development Services division in accordance with the application procedures set forth
in Article 5.2: Common Procedures.

files. The following findings shall establish the rationale for the granting of relief:
1. Relief is necessary due to the physical attributes and conditions of the property
and the proposed use or structure including, but not limited to, topography,
noise exposure, irregular property boundaries, or other unusual circumstance;
2. There are no alternatives to the requested modification that could provide
similar benefits with less potential detriment;
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
3-03-05 Chapter I, Article 5.3 Page 2

occupants of the property or would create a change in land use or density that
would be inconsistent with the requirements of this Code;
4. Granting the relief does not impose an undue financial or administrative
burden on the Town;
5. There are no compelling public interests that justify the denial of the requested
relief or the imposition of conditions;
6. The applicants demonstrated need substantially outweighs any detriment to
public needs and interests; and
7. If relief is being requested pursuant to the requirements of State or Federal law,
the relief is necessary to reasonably accommodate the needs of an applicant
pursuant to the specific requirements of State or Federal law.

5.401 Purpose and Applicability
Chapter I, Division 2: Land Use Regulations sets forth those uses for which a use permit is
required. No use requiring a use permit may be commenced until a use permit is obtained.
Generally these uses require special consideration to ensure that they can be designed, located,
and operated in a manner that will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of surrounding
properties. The process for review of use permit applications is designed to evaluate possible
adverse impacts and to minimize them where possible through the imposition of specific
conditions or requirements. Approval of a use permit requires review of the location, design,
configuration, and special impacts of a proposed use to determine, based on standards set forth in
the Zoning Code, the desirability of permitting the use on a particular site.
This article sets forth the requirements for three use permit classifications:
A. Administrative Use Permit. A use permit approved by the Zoning Administrator for a
use in specified districts based on a determination of compliance with standards set forth
in the Base District Regulations and individual review of their location, design,
configuration, intensity, and density of use or structures.
B. Conditional Use Permit. A use permit approved by the Planning Commission for a use
in specified districts based on a determination of compliance with standards set forth in
the Base District Regulations and individual review of their location, design,
configuration, intensity, and density of use or structures.
C. Special Use Permit. A use permit approved by the Planning Commission for a use in
any zoning district, based on consideration of the technical requirements of the use,
characteristics of the location where the use is proposed to be established, and impacts
on adjacent uses. Examples of uses that require Special Use Permits are Agritainment,
police and fire stations, wastewater treatment facilities, and water reservoirs.

Article 5.9: Protected Development Right Plan
Sections:
5.901 Purpose and Applicability
5.902 Procedures
5.903 General Provisions
5.904 Expiration Date and Extensions; Revocation
5.901 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this article is to provide procedures consistent with applicable State law
by which a plan may be designated as a Protected Development Right Plan. Except as
provided in Section 5.903C: Subsequent Designation, only a plan submitted to the Town
that is designated as a Protected Development Right Plan at the time of submittal shall be
processed as a Protected Development Right Plan.
A protected development right is the right to undertake and complete the development
and use of property under the terms and conditions of a Protected Development Right
Plan without compliance with subsequent changes in zoning regulations and development
standards, and precludes the enforcement against the development of any legislative or
administrative land use regulation of the town or an initiated measure that would change,
alter, impair, prevent, diminish, delay or otherwise impact the development or use of the
property as set forth in the approved Protected Development Right Plan. Upon approval
of a Protected Development Right Plan, the owner has a protected development right to
undertake and complete the development only to the extent of the specific elements and
details shown on the plan without compliance with subsequent changes in zoning
regulations and development standards.
This article sets forth the procedures for two classifications of Protected Development
Right Plans: non-phased developments and phased developments.
5.902 Procedures
A. Application. Applications shall be filed in accordance with application
procedures set forth in Article 5.2: Common Procedures and additional
application requirements set forth in this article. Applications may be filed for
non-phased development right plan, or phased development right plan.
1. Non-Phased developments. Non-phased developments are developments
that are constructed in one phase. Applications for Protected
Development Right Plan for non-phased developments shall comply with
the application requirements for final subdivision plat approval as set forth
in Chapter III: Subdivision Regulations.
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
2-24-11 Chapter I, Article 5.9 - Page 2
2. Phased developments. An application for a Protected Development Right
Plan for phased developments shall comply with the application
requirements set forth in this article and Article 3.1: Planned Area
Development Overlay Zoning District. The application shall identify all
improvements required to be constructed for each phase.
B. Application Content.
1. All Applications. All applications for a Protected Development Right Plan
shall include all of the following:
a. The proposed uses of the property;
b. The boundaries of the property;
c. Significant topographical and other natural features affecting
development of the property;
d. The location of all existing and proposed utilities and provisions
for other infrastructure on the property, including water, sewers,
road and pedestrian walkways; and
e. All other studies and reports required by the Zoning Code, the
Subdivision Regulations and other codes of the Town, including
traffic reports, drainage reports, master street plans, development
phasing schedules and phased public infrastructure schedules.
2. Non-Phased Developments. In addition to the requirements of Section
5.902B.1: All Applications, an application for a Protected Development
Right Plan for a non-phased development shall be submitted either as a
final subdivision plat application or as a Planned Area Development
Overlay district application and shall:
a. Designate the plan as a non-phased Protected Development Right
Plan at the time of submittal;
b. Include the general location on the property of the proposed
buildings, structures and other improvements; and
c. Include the number of dwelling units and the square footage and
height of the proposed buildings and other structures.
3. Phased Developments. In addition to the requirements of Section
5.902B.1: All Applications, an application for a Protected Development
Right Plan for a phased development shall:
Article 5.9: Protected Development Right Plan
2-24-11 Chapter I, Article 5.9 - Page 3
a. Designate the plan as a phased Protected Development Right Plan
at the time of submittal;
b. Be submitted as a Planned Area Development Overlay zoning
district;

and the schedule of development of each phase;
d. Include the general location on the property of the proposed
buildings, structures and other improvements for the first phase;
e. Include the number of dwelling units proposed for all phases of the
development; and
f. Include the square footage and height of the proposed buildings
and other structures for the first phase.
5.903 General Provisions
A. Final Subdivision Plat Protected Development Right Plan. The Protected
Development Right Plan for a non-phased development shall be the final
subdivision plat approved by the Town Council.
B. Planned Area Development Protected Development Right Plan. The Protected
Development Right Plan for a phased development shall be the Planned Area
Development Overlay zoning district approved by the Town Council for that
phase. Approval of a Protected Development Right Plan for one phase of a
phased development is not approval of a Protected Development Right Plan for
any other phase.
C. Subsequent Designation. The Town Council may designate by ordinance or
resolution a development plan that is not identified as a Protected Development
Right Plan at the time it is submitted, as a Protected Development Right Plan
upon a finding that granting a protected development right to undertake and
complete the development shown on the plan will promote reasonable certainty,
stability and fairness in the land use planning and regulatory process and secure
the reasonable investment-backed expectations of the owner.
D. Variances. A Protected Development Right Plan approved with a condition that a
variance be obtained does not confer a protected development right until the
variance is granted. Approval of a Protected Development Right Plan does not
guarantee approval of a variance.
E. Enforcement of Subsequent Land Use Regulations. A protected development
right does not preclude enforcement of land use regulations that would change,
Town of Gilbert Land Development Code
2-24-11 Chapter I, Article 5.9 - Page 4
alter, impair, prevent, diminish, delay or impact the development or use of the
property as approved in the Protected Development Right Plan under any of the
following circumstances:
1. Changes agreed to in writing by the owner.
2. Declaration by the Town Council by resolution after notice and a public
hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity
of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public
health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as approved in the
Protected Development Right Plan.
3. Declaration by the Town Council by resolution after notice and a public
hearing that the owner or his representative intentionally supplied
inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a
difference in the approval of the Protected Development Right Plan by the
Town.
4. The enactment of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes
development as approved in the Protected Development Right Plan, in
which case the Town Council, after notice and a public hearing, may
modify the affected provisions, on a finding that the change in state or
federal law has a fundamental effect on the Protected Development Right
Plan.
F. Overlay Zoning, Development Fees, Building Codes. A protected development
right does not preclude the enforcement of a subsequently adopted:
1. Overlay zoning classification that imposes additional requirements and
that does not affect the allowable type or density of use, or ordinances or
regulations that are general in nature and that are applicable to all
property, so long as the overlay zoning classification does not affect the
allowable type or density of use.
2. Development fees applicable to similar properties in the town adopted
pursuant to ARS § 9-463.05.
3. Building, fire, plumbing, electrical, or mechanical code or other ordinance
or regulation general in nature and applicable to all property subject to
land use regulation by the Town.
G. Non-Conforming Uses and Structures. A protected development right does not
preclude, change, or impair the authority of the Town to adopt and enforce zoning
ordinance provisions governing non-conforming uses or structures on the
property.
Article 5.9: Protected Development Right Plan
2-24-11 Chapter I, Article 5.9 - Page 5
H. Development Agreements. Nothing in this article shall preclude, change, or limit
the authority of the Town to enter into a Development Agreement pursuant to
ARS § 9-500.05.
5.904 Expiration Date and Extensions; Revocation
A. Expiration.
1. Non-Phased Development Right Plan. A Protected Development Right
Plan for a non-phased development is valid for 3 years. In its sole
discretion, the Town Council may extend this time period for a maximum

relevant circumstances, including the size and type of the development,
the level of investment of the landowner, economic cycles, and market
conditions. If no building permit has been issued prior to expiration, no
construction shall commence under the plan.
2. Phased Development Right Plan. A Protected Development Right Plan
for a phased development is valid for 5 years. In its sole discretion, the
Town Council may extend this time period for a maximum of 2 additional

2-24-11 Chapter I, Article 5.9 - Page 7

or exaction may be filed under this Subsection if the dedication or exaction is
imposed by a legislative act of the Town Council that does not give discretion to a
town official or town department to determine the nature or extent of the
dedication or exaction.
1. Findings. In determining whether a dedication or exaction is in violation
of the law, the Town has the burden to establish that:

Town has the burden to establish that the zoning regulation does not create
a taking. The Zoning Hearing Officer shall consider whether the zoning
regulation would deny all economic use of the property. In determining
whether the action would deny the owner all economic use of the property,
the Zoning Hearing Officer shall consider the following factors:

Council may reconsider its prior action. If the Zoning Hearing Officer

Town may accept as an alternative assurance of construction a written agreement
with the subdivider that no certificates of occupancy will be issued for a subdivision

deny final approval of any building permit or final building inspection for any
structure located within a subdivision unless a written certification has been
received from the Town Engineer that all required improvements are complete
and the work has been inspected and accepted. If the subdivider fails to
complete all required improvements in accordance with the terms of the
agreement, the Town Engineer may authorize the completion of the work. The
Town shall be reimbursed the costs (as determined by the Town Engineer) of
construction, installation, and dedication of the uncompleted portion of the
required improvements. The Town may take such action as necessary to
obtain reimbursements from the subdivider.
D. Town Completion of Work. If the subdivider abandons the installation of construction
of required improvements or fails to complete the improvements in accordance with the
Towns details and specifications, the Town may complete such installation or
construction and the cost shall be deducted from the assurance of construction. The cost
of construction exceeding the amount of the assurance shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider, and the Town may recover such construction costs through all available
remedies.

subdivision or subdivision improvements.
