Preface
In 2017, codification and administration of the Municipal Code began in-­house under the direction of the City Clerk and with the assistance of Municipal Code Online, Inc. This Municipal Code shall be cited as the St. Anthony Municipal Code or “SAMC” as an acronym.

This Municipal Code maintains a structure by subject matter using a decimal numbering system identifying the Title, Chapter, and section (for example: 1.01.010).

The first number in the sequence (1.01.010) designates the Title level, as written in the table of contents
The second series of numbers (1.01.010) designates the Chapter level, as written in the table of contents
The last series (1.01.010) designates the section level, and is expressed using three numerical values
If a fourth series exists comprising letters or numbers beyond the section level, it designates a subsection level
This complete set of numbers is designed to aid in searching the Municipal Code and to assist in subsequent codification as new ordinances are added to SAMC.

The legislation herein may be arranged as an alphanumeric ordered list A, 1, a, (1), (A), (a) to show hierarchal relationships. The legislation may also be arranged as an unordered list (using bullets, discs, squares, etc.) to show items without hierarchal relationships. These list structures assist in subsequent codification as new legislation is added.

Vacant titles, chapters, or sections may be designed for future use and may be marked “Reserved” to ease internal expansion. The legislative history identifies the specific legal sources of a section as may be provided in footnotes.

This Municipal Code is supplemented from time to ­time with amendments and additions made by St. Anthony City, Idaho. The specific legal sources that comprise this Municipal Code have been adapted during the codification process from the original formatting of the official hard copy. In the event of discrepancies between the online Municipal Code and the official hard copy, the official hard copy governs. Municipal Code Online, Inc., provides a searchable database of the Municipal Code for easy reference and convenience.

NOTICE: THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT ALL OR THE MOST CURRENT VERSION OF LEGISLATION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL THAT HAS YET TO BE UPDATED ONLINE. IN THE EVENT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND A WRITTEN ORDINANCE, THE ORDINANCE TYPICALLY GOVERNS. ALSO, THE MUNICIPAL CODE MAY NOT REFLECT RULES OR OTHER REGULATIONS PROMULGATED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE CODE, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT THE CITY CLERK AT 208-624-3494 or cclerk@cityofstanthony.org.

The fund is created for the purpose of guaranteeing to the extent of the fund the payment of bonds or warrants, or both, and interest thereon, issued against any local improvement district in the city for the payment of improvements therein.

(Ord. 555 § 2, 1974)
3.04.030 Annual Tax Levy
In order to provide money for the fund and for the use and purposes of the fund, the mayor and council of the city shall levy an annual tax of one mill per year, beginning with the tax due and collectible in the year 1973, on all of the taxable property in said city; provided, however, that the city may reduce the amount of the levy if the city appropriates from other proper sources, as may be determined by the city, a sum approximately equal in amount to the sum which it is estimated will be not collected but would have been collected except for the reduction of the levy; and provided further, that the total sum so levied and/or appropriated in any year shall not be more than sufficient to pay the outstanding warrants on the fund and to establish therein a balance, which combined levy and appropriations in any one year shall not exceed five per centum of the outstanding obligations thereby guaranteed; and provided further, that the city shall not levy any tax as herein provided when the amount of moneys in the "local improvement guarantee fund" equals ten per centum of the total outstanding obligations to be guaranteed.

Neither the holder nor the owner of any bond or warrant issued in any local improvement district shall have any claim therefor except for the payment from the special assessment made for the improvement for which said bond or warrant was issued and except against the "local improvement guarantee fund" as provided in this chapter. The city shall not be liable to any holder or owner of said bond or warrant for any loss to the guarantee fund occurring in the lawful operation thereof by the city.

3.04.050 Subrogation; Surplus Funds
Wherever there shall be paid out of the "local improvement guarantee fund" any sum on account of principal or interest of a local improvement bond or warrant, the city, as trustee for the fund, shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the holders or owners of the bonds or interest coupons or warrants so paid, and the policies thereof, or the assessment underlying the same, shall become part of the guarantee fund. There shall be paid into the guarantee fund any surplus remaining in any local improvement fund after the payment of all outstanding bonds or warrants payable out of such local improvement fund. Bonds or warrants guaranteed by such fund shall have no preference except in the order of presentation for payment.

(Ord. 555 § 5, 1974)

Money from the guarantee fund may be used to redeem property subject to local improvement assessments from general tax delinquencies, underlying bonds or warrants guaranteed by the fund, or to purchase such property at county tax sales, or otherwise, from the county for the purpose of protecting the guarantee fund. After so acquiring title to real property, the city may lease or sell and convey the same for such price and on such terms as may be determined by the council, and any provision of law, charter or ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding, and all proceeds resulting therefrom shall belong to and be paid into the guarantee fund; provided, however, that in any event the city purchases said property at tax sale, or otherwise, it shall not be sold for a lesser sum than the city paid therefor.

(Ord. 555 § 6, 1974)
3.04.070 Transfers And Appropriations
Whenever there is not a sufficient amount of cash in said "local improvement guarantee fund" at any time to pay any and all warrants, together with interest thereon, drawn against said fund, the city council may replenish said "local improvement guarantee fund" by transferring or appropriating to it, moneys from the general fund of the city or other available sources, as may be determined by said council, subject, however, to the limitations herein prescribed. Warrants drawing interest as provided in this chapter, may be issued against said "local improvement guarantee fund" to meet any financial liability against it; but, at the time of making its next annual tax levy, the city shall provide for the levy of a sum sufficient with other resources of the guarantee fund to pay warrants so issued and outstanding, the tax for this purpose not to exceed one mill in any one year.

(Ord. 555 § 7, 1974)
3.04.080 Claim Against The City
The holder or owner of any local improvement bond or warrant issued shall have no claim thereon against the city, except to the extent of the funds created and received by assessments against the property within any local improvement district and to the extent of his pro rata share of the "local improvement guarantee fund", authorized and issued under the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. 555 § 8, 1974)
3.04.090 Payment Of Excess To General Fund
If at any time the "local improvement guarantee fund" exceeds in amount of moneys held therein ten percent of the total outstanding obligations thereby guaranteed, then the city council, may, by ordinance, authorize the treasurer or appropriate official of said city to return and pay such said excess or any part thereof to the general fund of the city, to return and pay such said excess or any designated part thereof all or any part of local improvement district bonds of said city then issued and outstanding or to be issued. The passage of such ordinance shall require the affirmative vote of at least three-fourths of the full council.

(Ord. 555 § 9, 1974)
3.04.100 Termination
At such time, and not before, when all bonds and coupons of all local improvement districts in the city, hereafter issued, shall have been paid in full, the mayor and council may provide by ordinance that the amounts and all property rights in said "local improvement guarantee fund" shall revert to the general fund of the city, and said "local improvement guarantee fund" shall terminate and be nonexistent thereafter.

Licensed Dogs. The owner of every licensed dog so seized and impounded shall be notified by the police department of the seizure and impoundment within forty-eight hours thereafter. Notice shall be sufficient when made telephonically to the owner, or if the telephone number is unknown, it is made in writing. If made in writing, identify the dog by license number, state the date, time and place of the seizure, and place the notice in a sealed envelope addressed to the owner at his residence as appears on the application for the current license, and deposit it in the U.S. mail. Every licensed dog so seized shall be retained in the pound for a period of three business days after notice to the owner. At any time while the dog is so impounded, the owner may redeem the same by paying the city clerk the fees set forth in such schedule of fees as may be adopted by the city council, including that specified for each twenty-four hour period that the dog has been held in the pound. This will not relieve the owner from appearing in the county magistrate's court to answer any charges which may be filed for violating any provision of this chapter.

All dogs seized and impounded which do not have a collar and license as provided in Section 6.08.040 SAMC, and whose ownership is unknown to the police department, shall be retained in the pound for a period of seventy-two hours, during which time the dog may be released to the owner upon the payment of the pound fees as set forth in such schedule of fees as may be adopted by the city council and upon purchasing a license. This will not relieve the owner from appearing in the county magistrate's court to answer any charges that may be filed for violating any provisions of this chapter.
Unclaimed Dogs. The ownership of any dog not redeemed within the periods of time herein stated may be forfeited and the dog may be sold thereafter to any person or released to any humane society organization. Failure to redeem the dog will subject the owner to a penalty set forth in Appendix 1.
Disposal of Dogs. If any dog is not redeemed, sold or released to a humane society organization, the dog may be humanely destroyed and the carcass disposed of in any lawful manner.

If the owner of such dog does not appear at the pound within this seventy-two hour period, the dog shall be humanely destroyed and the carcass disposed of in any lawful manner. If the owner appears at the pound at any time during the seventy-two hour period, the code enforcement officer or his authorized representative shall deliver a written notice to the owner stating that the dog has been impounded as a vicious dog and the dog will be destroyed within ten days after the date of such delivery of the notice unless an order to show cause is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction and served upon the city clerk requiring the city to show cause why the dog should be destroyed. If such order is not served upon the city clerk within ten days of the date of the delivery of the notice to the owner, the dog shall be destroyed and disposed of as provided herein.

6.08.150 Kennel License - Required When; Application; Requirements
It is unlawful for an owner to possess upon property within the city limits more than two dogs, unless the owner has obtained a commercial or noncommercial kennel license.
Noncommercial Kennel.
Application for a noncommercial kennel license shall be made to the city clerk, accompanied by the fee as set forth in such schedule of fees as may be adopted by the city council. Dogs kept in a noncommercial kennel shall be owned only by members of the immediate household and a separate license shall be obtained for each dog. Such license shall not be issued unless at least seventy-five percent of all the owners or persons in possession of premises directly adjacent to, including those properties across streets or alleyways from, the premises upon which the kennel is to be maintained have consented to the operation of such a kennel. Upon receipt of such application, the city clerk shall request the code compliance officer to poll such persons to determine if they are willing to consent to the issuance of a noncommercial kennel license to the applicant. For purposes of determining the percentage, persons having joint control or ownership of such premises, shall be considered one person. Also upon receipt of the application the city clerk shall request the code compliance officer to review the plans for the proposed location and type of kennel for compliance with health and safety requirements for the dogs to be kept therein in accordance with Appendix 2.
Upon completion of kennel construction, the code compliance officer shall inspect it for such compliance. Periodically or upon receipt of a complaint, the code compliance officer shall check the kennel facility for such compliance. No person holding a noncommercial license shall keep any dog for breeding purposes for sale or for the purpose of raising such dog(s) for commercial sale. All dogs kept pursuant to a noncommercial kennel license shall be spayed or neutered within twelve weeks after their birth. No license shall be issued unless the applicant shall provide written certification by a licensed veterinarian that all licensed animals have been spayed or neutered or unless the applicant shall provide a certificate from the code compliance officer that he or she has inspected each animal and verified such spaying or neutering. A maximum of five dogs may be kept upon the premises owned by a person holding a noncommercial kennel license.
If more than twenty-five percent of the persons in possession of premises directly adjacent to, including those properties across streets or alleyways from, as described above, file complaints against the existence of a noncommercial kennel, the code compliance officer may give the kennel licensee written notice that he/she has thirty days within which to eliminate the area of complaint, or the license may be terminated. At the end of the thirty-day period, if each complaint is not withdrawn in writing by the complainant, the license shall be rescinded, and the licensee shall have an additional thirty days to bring himself into compliance with the statute by either removing dogs in excess of two, or obtaining another kennel license, as set out above. Consenting to any new kennel license by a complainant under a former license shall constitute a withdrawal of that prior complaint.
Commercial Kennel. A commercial kennel is a kennel where the owner or a keeper of dogs sells, boards, breeds, trains, treats or handles dogs for consideration, provided however that any clinic or place owned or operated by a veterinarian licensed under state law or the city pound shall not be considered a commercial kennel. Applications for a commercial kennel license shall be made to the city clerk. The application must be accompanied by a license fee as set forth in such schedule of fees as may be adopted by the city council. No license may be issued unless at least seventy-five percent of all property owners directly adjacent to, including properties across streets or alleyways from, the property upon which the kennel will be operated have consented to the issuance of such license. Upon receipt of such application the city clerk shall request the code compliance officer to poll such owners to see if they are willing to consent to such commercial kennel. A commercial kennel shall not be issued for any premises where such use is not permitted under city zoning ordinances. Upon renewal of a commercial kennel license a re-polling of neighboring owners shall not be required unless within one year prior to the expiration of such license one or more complaints have been filed in writing with the police department regarding the applicant's maintenance of such kennel. In such event no license shall be issued until the code compliance officer has conducted a new poll and the required consents have been obtained.
Re-applications Limited. No application for a commercial or non-commercial license shall be accepted or processed if an application for the same type of license to operate on the same property has been denied within one year previous to the date of application.

The commission may conduct research on and study unfair housing practices in order to develop more effective methods for eliminating unfair housing practices, and may publish or cause to be published the results of such research and study when in the judgment of the commission such publications will aid in the elimination of unfair housing practices. However, the fair housing commission shall not expend city funds for research or call in an outside consultant for this research without the approval of the city council.

13.08.040 Services
Definition. The "service connection" shall be that part of the water distribution system which connects the meter to the main and shall normally consist of corporation stop, service pipe, curb stop and box, meter, meter yoke, and meter box. The "customer service line" shall be that part of the piping on the customer's property that connects the service to the customer's distribution system.
Ownership, Installation, and Maintenance. The customer shall own, install, and maintain the customer service line. All trenching and laying of the service pipe to be installed as part of the service connection shall be performed exclusively by the applicant, at the applicant's expense, and under such supervision of the water department that the city deems appropriate. The applicant shall use materials approved by the water department. The water department shall connect the "service connection" to the main lines and install the meter box, meter curb stop, and related appurtenances.
After installation of the service connection, the water department shall own and maintain the entire service connection. Maintenance shall only be performed by authorized employees of the water department.
Service Connection Charge. At the time the applicant files for service where no service previously existed, or if he or she is filing for a change in service size or location, he or she shall submit with his or her application the service connection charge for water service and sewer service. This charge is to include a service connection fee plus the actual cost to the water department to connect the service to the main and the meter and meter housing and related appurtenances.

The service connection fee (or charge) shall be established by the city council by resolution upon passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and be reviewed from time to time and updated by resolution of the city council.

Size of Service. The water department will furnish and install a service of such size and at such locations as the applicant requests, provided such requests are reasonable and that the size requested is one that is listed by the water department. The minimum size of service shall be three-fourths inch. The water department may refuse to install a service line which is undersized or oversized as determined by a study and report of the superintendent to the city council.
Class of Service. A monthly service charge shall be billed for each current hookup connected to the water system with the following exceptions:
Multiple Users on One Hookup. One monthly service charge will be billed for each occupied single-family dwelling, occupied trailer house, occupied mobile home, and occupied unit of a duplex. The water department shall determine the number of premises on one connection and shall also determine the number of monthly service charges to be billed. If the number of premises changes, it shall be entirely the responsibility of the owner to promptly notify the city in writing as to the revised number of premises subject to a monthly service charge. This written notice must be received by the city before the last day of the month in which the change has occurred.
Meters Hooked to Sprinkler Systems. Meters hooked to sprinkler systems used only for summer irrigation will be charged by the number of gallons of water used. A base rate will also be charged for this meter. Meters will be read before turning on the sprinkler system each spring. Cost for the extra meter will be paid by the homeowner.
Changes in Service Size. Permanent changes in the size of the service line requested by the customer shall be paid by the customer on the basis of actual cost to the water department for making the change.
Length of Service. Where the main is in a public right-of-way, the meter if required will be placed at the right-of-way line nearest the property to be serviced for the standard connection fee, provided the length of service line does not exceed the width of the right-of-way.

Where the main is on an easement or publicly-owned property other than designated rights-of-way, the services shall be installed to the boundary of the easement or public property by the water department, provided the length of service does not exceed thirty feet.

If, in either case cited above, the length of service line to the meter location exceeds the maximum stated, the applicant shall pay the extra cost of the line on the basis of actual cost to the water department for labor, materials and equipment plus fifteen percent.

Joint Service Connections. The water department may, at its option, serve two or more premises with one connection. On new service connections, the inside diameter of such joint lines shall be sufficient to provide a carrying capacity of not less than the combined capacity of individual service lines of the same size as the meters installed.

Service extensions from an existing service to other occupancies or ownerships than that for which the existing service was intended shall not be permitted nor shall separate residences be permitted to receive service through one meter except under special considerations approved by the city council.

Number of Service Connections on Premises. The owner of a single parcel of property may apply for and receive as many services as he and his tenants may require, provided his or her application or applications meet the requirements of the policies, rules, and regulations. However, the owner shall be required to pay for all services.
Standby Fire Protection Service Connections.
Purpose. Standby fire protection connections of two-inch size and larger will be installed only if adequate provisions are made to prevent the use of water from such services for purposes other than fire extinguishing. Sealed fire sprinkler systems with water-operated alarms shall be considered as having such provisions. The water department may require that a suitable detector check meter be installed in the standby fire protection service connections, to which hose lines or hydrants are connected. All piping on the customer's premises shall be installed in accordance with the Plumbing Code of the State of Idaho.
Charges for Service. Charges for standby fire protection service shall be determined by resolution by city council upon written request for a standby fire protection connection. No charge will be made for water used in the standby fire protection services to extinguish accidental fires or for routine testing of the fire protection system. The customers shall pay the full cost of the standby protection service connection, any required detector check meters, and any required special water meter installed for the service to the standby connection.
Violations of Regulations. If water is used from a standby pipe connection service in violation of these regulations, an estimate of the amount used will be computed by the water department. The customer shall pay for the water used at the regular rates, including the minimum charge based on the size of the service connection and subsequent bills rendered on the basis of the regular water rates.
Fire Service Connections Other Than Standby. A service having fire protection facilities on the premises and water for other purposes flowing through the same service connection shall be considered as an ordinary service and metered as such. All water used through that service, regardless of its use, will be charged at the regular rates.
Temporary Service Connections. For water service of a temporary nature, applicants shall be required to pay in advance the estimated cost of installation and removal of metering equipment and materials, plus a reasonable depreciation charge for the use of equipment and material furnished by the water department. The applicant shall also pay his or her water bill in advance and based on an estimate of the quantity to be used, or he or she shall otherwise establish satisfactory credit.
Time Limit. Temporary service connections shall be disconnected and terminated within six months after installation unless an extension of time is granted in writing by the water department.
Charge for Water Served. Charges for water furnished through a temporary service connection shall be at the established rates set forth in the current water rate schedule.
Installation Charge and Deposits. The applicant for temporary service will be required:
To pay the water department, in advance, the estimated cost of installing and removing all facilities necessary to furnish each service.
To deposit an amount sufficient to cover bills for water during the entire period such temporary service may be used, or to otherwise establish credit approved by the water department.
To deposit with the utility an amount equal to the value of any equipment loaned by the water department to such applicant under the terms of Subsection (L)(4).
Responsibility for Meters and Installation. The customer shall use all possible care to prevent damage to the meter or to any other loaned facilities of the water department. If the meter or other facilities are damaged, the cost of making repairs shall be deducted from the deposit fund. If the loaned materials are returned in satisfactory condition and all bills paid, the full amount of the equipment deposit will be returned to the temporary customer at the termination of service.
Customer's Plumbing.
Plumbing Code. The customer's plumbing, which shall include the customer's service line and all plumbing, piping, fixtures, and other appurtenances carrying or intended to carry water, sewer or drainage, shall comply with the Plumbing Code of the State of Idaho.
Control Valves. Customers shall install a suitable control valve in the customer service line as close to the meter as possible, the operation of which will control the entire water supply to the premises served. In the event a customer's service is discontinued for any reason, a control valve must be installed, if none exists, as provided by this subsection.

It shall be a violation of these rules and regulations for the customer to operate, cause, or permit unauthorized operation of the meter stop or any appurtenances on the service connection.
Service Line Liability. The customer shall be responsible and liable for any malfunctioning, breakage, freezing, or any other problem from any cause whatsoever, which occurs in the service line.

The deposit will be returned to the customer if the test reveals the meter to over register more than two percent under the standard test conditions. However, if the meter tests within two percent accuracy, the deposit shall be retained by the water department. Customers may at their option witness any meter tests which they request.
On Water Department Request. If, upon comparison of past water usage, it appears that a meter is not registering properly, the water department may at its option test the meter and adjust the charges accordingly if the meter either over registers or under registers. No charge for meter testing will be made to the customer for the meter test under these conditions.
Adjustments of Bill for Meter Error.
No credits or debits will be borne by the city or the customer should the tested meter show variance high or low, from the accuracy defined in subsection A of this section.
Non-Registering Meters. The water department will bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The bill will be computed upon an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer's prior use during the same season of the year, or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same season and under similar circumstances and conditions.

Disputed Bills. When a customer disputes the correctness of a bill, he or she shall deposit the amount of the disputed bill at the time the complaint is lodged, to preclude discontinuance of service pending final settlement of the bill or bills. Subsequent bills shall be paid or placed on deposit in a similar manner. Failure of the customer to make such a deposit shall warrant discontinuance of service as provided under subsection (F) of this section.
Failure to Read Meters. In the event that it shall be impossible or impractical to read a meter on the regular reading date, the water consumption shall be prorated on the basis of thirty days per month and the total water consumption for billing purposes for that period shall be estimated.
Payment of Bills. Each bill rendered shall contain the final date on which payment is due. If the bill is not paid by that date, the account shall be considered delinquent, unless other arrangements have been made with the water department in writing that specify another due date.

Nonpayment of Sewer Service Charges. If said sewer service charges are not paid when due by any such person, firm, or corporation whose premises are served or who are subject to the charges herein provided, water service provided to that customer by the city of St. Anthony water department may be discontinued because of the default in the payment of the sewer service charges. As an additional alternative method, if such rates and charges are not paid when due by any such person, firm, or corporation, the amounts so unpaid may be certified by the city clerk to the county assessor of Fremont County, Idaho, and shall be by him assessed against the premises served as provided by law and shall be collected and paid over to the city in the same manner as other taxes are assessed, collected, and paid over, with interest. Interest on unpaid bills shall run from the due date thereof at a rate to be determined by the city. Such unpaid charges may also be recovered in an action at law in the name of the city, with interest as aforesaid.

Discontinuance of service from one or both of these causes will be made immediately upon receipt of knowledge by the water department that the condition or conditions exist.
Unauthorized Turn-On. Where water service has been discontinued for any reason and the water is turned on by the customer or other unauthorized person, the water may then be shut off at the main or the meter removed. The charges for shutting off the water at the main or re moving the meter shall be computed at actual cost to the water department plus fifteen percent overhead. These charges shall be billed to the offending customer, and water shall not be furnished to the premises or customer until such charges are paid and the water department has reasonable assurance that the violation will not re-occur.

15.24.040 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application:

"Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
"Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year; also referred to as the "100-year flood." Designation on maps always includes the letters A or V.
"Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard.
"Flood" or "flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
"Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
"Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this chapter found at Section 15.24.150(B) SAMC.
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days. For insurance purposes, the term "manufactured home" does not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
"New construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days of the permit date. The "actual start" means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. "Permanent construction" does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
"Substantial improvement" means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either:
Before the improvement or repair is started; or
If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
(Ord. 90-3 § 2, 1990)

15.24.050 Development Permit

Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to:

Permit Review.
Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required;
Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development is located in the floodway. If located in the floodway, assure that the encroachment provisions of Section 15.24.180A SAMC are met.
Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.24.030 SAMC, the local administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Article III of this chapter.
Information to be Obtained and Maintained.
Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study or required as in subsection B of this section, obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.
For all new or substantially improved flood-proofed structures:
Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level), and
Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in subsection A of this section;
Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.
Alteration of Watercourses.
Notify adjacent communities and the state prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration;
Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed, as to exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation. Such appeals shall be granted consistent with the standards of Section 60.6 of the rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR 59-76.)
(Ord. 90-3 § 4.3, 1990)

15.24.080 Review Of Building Permits
Where elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source (Section 15.24.070(B)), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones may result in higher insurance rates.

16.01.010 Title
These regulations shall officially be known and cited as the "Subdivision Ordinance of the City of St. Anthony, Idaho."

(Ord. No. 2015-02, § 2, 2-26-2015)
16.01.020 Purposes And Functions
These provisions are adopted to provide for the orderly division and development of land within the city. Their primary function shall be to provide a process to review development proposals to assure that public and shared private facilities are designed and constructed to serve the households and businesses that will depend upon them and that such development properly integrates with the existing community in ways that minimize public costs while protecting the quality of the natural and developed environment. This subdivision ordinance is a tool that serves the purpose of implementing comprehensive plan policies in conjunction with related land use and development ordinances. It is intended to assure provision of adequate and efficient streets, water supply, sewerage, drainage, parks, pedestrian pathways and public facilities by applying proper standards and allowing public participation in the course of review. The title seeks to have the community bear no more than its fair share of any cost of providing services by requiring the applicant to install improvements, pay fees, furnish land, or undertake proportionate mitigation measures to provide a fair share of capital facilities needs generated by the development. The subdivision ordinance also seeks to encourage the wise use and management of natural resources to preserve the stability and desirability of the community and the value of the land. The subdivision process strives to assure provision of open space through the efficient design and layout of land and shared facilities, maintaining the intensity of development as directed by the city's comprehensive plan in conjunction with the zoning ordinance.

(Ord. No. 2015-02, § 2, 2-26-2015)
16.01.030 Authority
This title is adopted pursuant to the authority delegated to the City of St. Anthony pursuant to Article 12, Section 2 of the Idaho Constitution; Chapter 65, Title 67, Idaho Code (Local Land Use Planning Act) and Chapter 13, Title 50, Idaho Code (Plats and Vacations).

(Ord. No. 2015-02, § 2, 2-26-2015)
16.01.040 Approval Required
The provisions of this title shall be administered in pursuit of orderly growth and development and shall supplement and implement provisions of the comprehensive plan and capital improvements plan. By virtue of this title, the city council, planning and zoning commission and administrative staff of the City of St. Anthony are vested with the authority to review, approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove applications for subdivision of land in accordance with the process and standards established hereby. No land development activity that constitutes subdivision or installation of subdivision improvements pursuant to the requirements of this title nor the filing of a subdivision plat in the office of the county recorder shall be undertaken without first obtaining the permits or approvals required by this title.

(Ord. No. 2015-02, § 2, 2-26-2015)
16.01.050 Interpretation And Conflict
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this title shall be held to be minimum requirements. Sound engineering practices may require alternative designs to assure the integrity of public or shared private improvements. More stringent engineering requirements may be imposed if necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Where any provision of these requirements imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation, or other provision of law, the provision which is more restrictive or imposes the standards most likely to protect the public health, safety and general welfare shall control.

Chapter 16.17 Standards For Open Space Subdivision Design
16.17.010 Design Component Of Open Space Subdivision

16.17.010 Design Component Of Open Space Subdivision
The design component of an open space subdivision cannot be over emphasized. The requirements support creation of a proper balance between density, design, and open space which respects the site specific topography and natural environment. The other important factor is to assure proper long term maintenance of both the built environment and open space components of the subdivision. Open space may be comprised of two types of land: Primary open space areas and secondary open space areas.

Primary Open Space Areas. The primary open space areas consist of the following and shall be included in the required open space except where these characteristics comprise more area than the percent of required open space:
Wetlands;
Lands that are generally inundated (under ponds, lakes, creeks, etc.);
Land within the one hundred year floodplain or required stream corridor setbacks;
Slopes exceeding thirty-three percent;
Soils susceptible to slumping.
Secondary Open Space Areas. Greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary open space areas. Secondary open space areas shall include the most sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic, and cultural resources on the remaining property and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources:
Moderate to steep slopes, particularly those adjoining water courses and ponds, where disturbance and resulting soil erosion and sedimentation could be detrimental to water quality.
Agricultural lands (including important farmland, lands historically used for irrigated and non-irrigated row crops, pasture and grazing lands, windbreak plantings or orchards).
Healthy woodlands (particularly those performing important ecological functions, such as soil stabilization and protection of streams, wetlands, and wildlife habitats).
Hedgerows, groups of trees, large individual trees standing alone.
Visually prominent topographic features such as knolls, hilltops and ridges, and scenic viewsheds as seen from public roads, particularly those with historic features.
Aquifer recharge areas.
Areas with highly permeable (excessively drained) soils.
Significant wildlife habitat areas.
Sites or structures identified as having historic, archeological, or cultural features.
Existing trails connecting the tract to other locations around the city.
Minimum Open Space. Although the resource lands listed as primary or secondary conservation areas may comprise more than the required area of open space, no applicant shall be required to designate more than twelve percent of open space required; however, other standards of this title or other statutes may further limit the development of the remaining land.
Open Space—Ownership, Use, Protection and Long Term Maintenance. Applicants shall demonstrate compliance with the open space land ownership and maintenance standards of this title.
Ownership. Open space may be owned and managed individually, jointly by an association, corporation or trust, a municipality, a recognized land trust or conservancy, or in combination of any of the above.
Condominium Association. Common facilities may be controlled through the use of condominium agreements. Such agreements shall be in accordance with relevant Idaho state law. All open space and common facilities shall be held as common elements.
Homeowner Association. Common facilities may be held in common ownership by a homeowner association, subject to all of the provisions for homeowner association set forth in state regulations and statutes. In addition, the following regulations shall be met:
The applicant shall provide the city a description of the organization of the proposed association, including its bylaws, and all documents governing ownership, maintenance, and use restrictions for common facilities.
The proposed association shall be established by the owner or applicant and shall be operating (with financial subsidization by the owner or applicant, if necessary) before the sale of any dwelling units in the project.
Four-Step Site Planning Procedures for Open Space Subdivisions.

Four-Step Process. Each sketch plan shall follow a four-step design process described below. When the preliminary plat is submitted, applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed roads, house lots, and open space lands. Applicants shall be prepared to submit four separate sketch overlay maps indicating the findings of each step of the design process, with respect to the features identified herein, if so requested by the administrator.
Step One—Designing the Open Space. During the first step, all potential conservation areas (both primary and secondary as described above) are identified. Consider site characteristics of the parcel being subdivided as well as the surrounding land. Open space subdivision design should be considered from a broad perspective that balances visual impacts, impacts to agriculture, impacts to environmentally sensitive areas and impact to adjacent property owners to achieve the best possible relationship between development and open space areas.
The minimum acreage of required open space land shall be submitted as part of the subdivision plan in accordance with this title. Open space land shall include all primary conservation areas up to the required minimum open space. Any remaining required open space land consists of secondary conservation areas—those parts of the remaining buildable lands with the highest resource significance.
Proposed open space land shall be designated as a base map and complying with applicable sections of this title dealing with resource conservation and open space delineation standards. If the application proposes a zone change, the city's preferred land use map in the comprehensive plan shall also be referenced and considered. Primary conservation areas shall be delineated comprising floodplains, wetlands, and slopes over thirty-three percent.
In delineating secondary conservation areas, the applicant shall prioritize the natural and cultural resources on the tract in terms of their suitability for inclusion in the proposed open space, in consultation with the commission and in accordance with this title.
On the basis of those priorities and practical considerations given to the project's configuration, its relation to resource areas on adjoining and neighboring properties, and the applicant's subdivision objectives, secondary conservation areas shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area requirements for open space land and in a manner clearly indicating their boundaries as well as the types of resources included within them.
Provide open space that is not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the application. To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels (such as existing conservation easements, public parks, or public lands). Such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated open space systems.
As these standards are implemented, the protected open spaces in each new subdivision should eventually adjoin each other, ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the community. Connectivity between adjoining subdivisions is required. Maintaining historically existing public access to public lands or water resources is also required.
Step Two—Location of House Sites. During the second step, potential house sites are tentatively located. Because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision, subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan. The majority of homesites should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access. Safe and convenient access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided (except in the case of farmland, or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance).
Potential house sites shall be located along the street network, at least twenty-five percent of which should be single-loaded, meaning that application shall occur on one side only along those segments.
Unless otherwise specified in this title, dwelling units shall be set back at least one hundred feet from primary conservation areas and at least ten feet from secondary conservation areas. Setbacks from conservation areas take into consideration the potential negative impacts of residential application on such areas as well as the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for the residences.
If development must be located in open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least productive agricultural soils, or in locations that will facilitate the continued agricultural use of the open space, or in locations that can be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as planting a screen consisting of indigenous native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers. Create sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses.
Minimize impacts on large woodlands especially those containing a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive weeds. Also, development of areas with native vegetation of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided.
Establish buffer zones and leave scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly along public ways and scenic corridors of rural roads with historic buildings.
Avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage of lower topographic features.
Step Three—Layout of Streets and Squares. The third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and economical way. When lots and access streets are laid out, they shall be located in a way that avoids or minimizes adverse impacts to open space areas and adjacent lands. To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings shall be minimized.
Identify the tentative locations of the more formal open space elements such as greens, commons, squares and parks.
Create a connected street network consistent with other street design standards in this title.
Provide active recreational areas including an interconnected pedestrian circulation system in suitable locations that offer safe convenient access to residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots.
Show schematic locations and types of stormwater management, sanitary sewer and water supply systems.
Streets shall be designed to:
Parallel and preserve existing tree lines, hedgerows, stone walls and watercourses.
Minimize alteration of natural, cultural, or historic features.
Minimize the acreage devoted to streets.
Calm traffic speeds.
Promote pedestrian movement.
Secure the view to prominent natural vistas.
Be aligned so that the "terminal vista" is of civic buildings or open space land, either manmade (greens, commons, squares, parks) or natural (such as, but not limited to, meadows, large specimen trees and woodlands).
Minimize crossing of primary conservation areas.
All streets, with the exception of loop streets and loop lanes, shall terminate at other streets within the project, and at least two streets shall provide connections to existing or proposed through-streets or collectors outside the project, wherever practicable and as required by this title.
Loop lanes shall be designed with a central median running their entire length, bounded on each side by a one-way lane not less than fourteen feet in paved width. The median shall be at least thirty feet wide, and shall be planted with shade trees along both sides at intervals not less than twenty-five feet.
Step Four—Lot Lines. The fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines and, where applicable, the building envelopes.
Other Design Considerations. The configuration of open space land shall comply with the following standards:
Except for civic and recreational spaces, such as squares and playing fields, open space land shall be free of all structures, excluding, however, historic buildings, stone walls, and structures related to open space land uses. The city may grant approval of structures and improvements required for storm drainage, sewage treatment, and water supply within the open space land, provided that such facilities are not detrimental to the open space. Acreage for such uses shall not be credited towards minimum open space, unless the land is appropriate for passive recreational use.
Except for formal greens, commons, squares, parks, playing fields, and trail corridors, open space land should not have a length-to-width ratio of less than 4:1, or be less than seventy-five feet in width.
Open space land shall adjoin the largest practicable number of lots within the application. Non-adjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient pedestrian access to open space land.
Open space land designated for active recreational uses shall not negatively impact adjacent dwelling units, parking, driveways, and roads.
Open space land shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a continuous network of such lands within and adjoining the city.
Open space land shall provide buffers to adjoining parks, preserves, or other protected lands.
Except in those cases where part of the open space is located on private house lots or agricultural use, open space land shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the residents of the subdivision. Consideration shall be given to providing for public access on such trails if they are linked to other publicly accessible pathway systems within the county. Provisions should be made for access to the open space land, as required for land management and emergency purposes.
Open space land shall be undivided by public or private streets, except where necessary for proper traffic circulation.
Open space land shall be suitably maintained either by retaining existing natural cover and wooded areas, continuing agricultural use and/or according to a landscaping plan to protect and enhance open space resources.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.01.100 Principles Of Interpretation
Provided that the context does not give rise to practical difficulties, interpretations of certain zoning ordinance language and certain standards will usually be applied in the following manner:

Buildings Across Parcel Description Lines. Provided legal and contiguous parcels of record are owned by the same property owner(s), building(s) that have been developed across property lines shall merge the properties into one parcel for the determination of zoning standards.
Fences and Wall Height Measurement. Maximum fence and wall height shall be measured from the finished grade at the property line. That portion of a wall or fence functioning as a retaining wall shall not be counted in determining overall fence or wall height.
Setback Encroachments. Setbacks shall not be less than the minimum dimension specified in the relevant section, except as follows:
Cornices, canopies, eaves, or other similar architectural features not providing additional floor space within the building may extend into a required side, front or rear yard setback no more than three feet. Setbacks will be measured from the property line to the foundation of the principal structure. A minimum of five feet separation is required between adjacent building overhangs, canopies, etc. Paved, uncovered parking is generally allowed in setback areas, unless other restrictions prohibit.
Interpretation of District Boundaries. Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any zoning district as shown on the official zoning map, the following shall apply:
Where zone boundaries are indicated as approximately following the centerline of street, alley, or highway right-of-way lines, streams, lakes or other bodies of water, the centerline shall be construed to be such boundary. Where the zoning boundary follows a railroad right-of-way, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the center of the right-of-way, unless otherwise clearly designated.
Where zone boundaries approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the boundaries.
Where zone boundaries are approximately parallel to the centerlines or street lines of streets, or the centerlines or right-of-way lines of highways, such zone boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the official zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the official zoning map.

Public hearings are distinguished from ordinary public meetings by expressly allowing and encouraging active public participation in the planning and zoning process. The purpose of the public hearing process is to gather information from the public concerning issues relevant to making a decision concerning particular issues and requests. The resultant opinions and evidence submitted create part of the record upon which the decision-makers must base their decisions. Public hearing opportunities are governed by procedures adopted by the council (see Chapter 2.66 SAMC or succeeding ordinance) and are conducted by the chairman of the meeting at which the public hearing occurs. Public hearing procedures provide general guidelines and may be varied in order to allow orderly decision-making that respects the interests of all parties concerned with a proposal or request. Legislative hearings are conducted to obtain general public comment about proposals to change planning and zoning law. Quasi-judicial hearings address specific applications for permits or approvals and must maintain due process protections for all with qualified interests.

17.04.010 Boundary And Purposes
Fremont County ("County'') and the City of St. Anthony ("City") enter into this agreement for the purpose of providing regulations in the unincorporated area surrounding the City, so that the pattern of development in that area is made compatible with the reasonably likely future expansion of the City–or of services provided by the City–into that area.
Boundary: The boundary of the St. Anthony Area of City Impact is set forth on the map attached as "Exhibit A".
The City's reasons for selecting these boundaries are:
The boundaries of the Area of Impact in this ordinance are the current boundaries of the Area of Impact in which the City has continued to grow and see urban development. The current area of impact should be sufficient to accommodate the growth expected by the City in the next ten to twenty years
The City expects the area within the proposed boundaries to develop as residential and other uses which should be compatible with the natural growth of the city and its infrastructure and services.
The area within the proposed boundaries is within the natural trade area for the City.
The area within the proposed boundaries is that area most likely to ensure that adequate public facilities and services are provided to residents at reasonable costs.
The availability of the land within the proposed boundaries will most directly encourage urban development within and adjacent to the City.
The County, by entering into this agreement, accepts the City's rationale for the agreed upon boundaries.
In the case where a property under single ownership is divided by the boundary line of the City of St. Anthony Impact Area, and the line divides such property so that one of both of the parts have a depth of three hundred feet (300') or less, such part shall be included in the jurisdiction within which the larger portion of the property is located.
Upon annexation of any part of the Impact Area into the City, the provisions of this Chapter shall no longer apply to such annexed area.

The regulations for each district set forth by this title are minimum regulations and shall apply to each type of land use, except as otherwise provided. No building, structure or land shall be used or occupied and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with the regulations specified in this title for the zoning district in which it is located. No building or other structure shall be erected or altered to provide for greater height or bulk, accommodate or house a greater number of residential units, or to occupy a greater percentage of lot area than allowed by this title. No yard area or lot existing at the time of passage of this title shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this title. Yards or lots created after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title shall meet at least the minimum requirements set forth in this title. Uses and structures lawfully existing on the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this title was derived may continue so long as they are not changed in ways that conflict with provisions of this title. No aspect of nonconformity may be expanded contrary to the provisions of this title, except by means of variance.

Zoning district standards and dimensional limitations are established in order to achieve the following:

Desired Community Character. Ensure the protection of the desired community character of each zoning district.

Housing and Business Opportunities. Promote adequate housing and business activities with the city.

Stability. Promote the stability of existing land uses and protect them from inharmonious influences and harmful intrusions.

Compatible Development. Ensure that uses and structures enhance their sites and are compatible with the natural beauty of the city's setting and its natural resources.

Mitigation of Negative Impacts. Mitigate negative impacts of certain uses within the zoning districts.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.06.030 General Standards Applicable To All Zones
The following standards shall apply to each of the zones established herein unless otherwise stated.

Project Plan Approval. All projects constructed within the zones established herein, must submit, prior to beginning construction, a site drawing for review and approval by City of St. Anthony staff. All structures must comply with adopted building ordinance requirements.
Prior Created Lots. Lots or parcels of land which were legally and lawfully created prior to the application of the zone shall not be denied a building permit solely for reason of nonconformance with the parcel requirements of this chapter.
Parking, Loading, and Access. All parking, loading and access within each of the zones established in the title shall be subject to the requirements and restrictions of the parking and loading requirements of Title 10 SAMC of this code as well as Chapter 9 SAMC of this title.
Signs. The placement of signs in all of the zones established herein are subject to the restrictions and requirements of Chapter 15.20 SAMC of this code.
Exceptions. The following structures may be erected on or projected into any required setback or right-of-way:
Screening and fencing within each of the zones established herein shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with the standards established in Chapter 9 SAMC of this title and other city codes or ordinances.
Landscape elements including trees, shrubs, agricultural crops and other plants.
Necessary appurtenances for utility service.
In all zones, the area between the curb and gutter, and the sidewalk, is to be landscaped and maintained by the adjacent property owner. For the purpose of insuring visibility and safety in residential zones and other zones which require buildings to be set back from the property line, the triangle of land formed on any corner lot by drawing a line between points on the lot lines, which are forty feet from the intersection of such lot lines, shall be free from any sight obscuring structure or obstruction except as permitted. Trees in such triangles shall be trimmed to at least twelve feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets.

See also Chapter 9 SAMC for additional standards.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.06.040 Residential Zones
Residential zones are intended to provide a living environment that supports a place for families and individuals to live with limited adverse influence from commercial or industrial activity and to permit other accessory uses that are associated and compatible with residential use. Certain residential zones may be established that allow higher residential densities, and hence higher activity levels, but always with the goal of enjoyment of a residential environment. Residential zones are primarily applied in the areas designated residential in the comprehensive plan. Permitted uses, special uses and lot area and building bulk and placement requirements shall comply with the standards set forth in this title. A primary distinction between low density and higher density residential neighborhoods should be the ability of community infrastructure to accommodate higher levels of activity without creating undue congestion, without unduly stressing utility systems that support development and without compromising the quality of public facilities.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.06.050 General Standards Applicable To Residential Zones
The following standards shall apply to each of the residential zones established herein unless otherwise stated.

Accessory buildings larger than two hundred square feet shall meet the same side yard requirements as principal buildings.
Comply with all lot coverage requirements. An accessory building or group of accessory buildings in any residential zone shall not cover more than thirty percent of the rear yard.
Only be used for those accessory uses allowed in the respective zone.
Accessory buildings shall not be placed in the front yard.
Accessory buildings may be placed in any location in the rear yard not otherwise in conflict with this title, unless the accessory building is a garage with doors opening into the alley. Such garages shall be located at least fifteen feet from the alley.
Additional Exception. When fifty percent or more of the lots on the same side of the street have been built, all buildings erected, established, or rebuilt shall be in conformity with the average setback of such buildings. In all residential zones, all buildings erected, established, or rebuilt shall be required to construct sidewalks. For new construction these should be a minimum of seven feet behind the curb and gutter, however where sidewalks already exist, the placement of new sidewalks shall align with existing sidewalks.
Distance Between Buildings. The distance between any accessory building and a dwelling shall not be less than six feet. The distance between buildings containing dwellings on the same lot shall not be less than ten feet or as per the building code, whichever is greater.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.06.060 Rural Cluster Residential Zone (RC1)
Purpose. This zone is established in order to preserve the rural character and natural resources in the impact area around the city, and maintaining large open spaces in view areas are essential to ensure this openness is preserved. To achieve this, this zone permits residential development at an overall base density of housing clustered onto smaller lot sizes of one-half to one acre, while maintaining large contiguous tracts of open land. This zone is intended for use only in the impact area.
Permitted Uses. Permitted and special uses for this zone are established in the Land Use Matrix, Table 6.1.
Area Requirements and Standards.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.06.190 Public Lands (PL1)
Purpose. This zone is established to include civic, public, and governmental facilities. These include churches, schools, governmental services, community recreation facilities, etc. Public facilities areas without a fixed location are identified in the preferred land use map of the comprehensive plan to identify the need for these uses in new residential zones of the community as they develop. These public facilities should be co-located with other uses to establish central areas of neighborhood activity as the new residential areas develop.
Permitted Uses. Permitted and special uses for this zone are established in the Land Use Matrix, Table 6.3.
Area Requirements and Standards.
Area, Width, Location, Height and Size. There shall be no area, width, location, height and size requirements for commercial buildings and structures constructed in accordance with the Building Code of St. Anthony, except that setbacks from public streets shall be set back from major arterials at least seventy-five feet from the centerline, or at least fifty feet from the right-of-way of such roads, whichever is greater; except major arterials or adjacent to platted areas shall be set back thirty feet.

Because of the potentially large size and unique operational characteristics of certain uses or facilities and their potential impact on other property and the natural environment, all development proposals shall require design plan review and approval from the city building inspector and review and approval by the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission may impose additional requirements to the building permit necessary to satisfy this title. All uses within this district shall be designed and built in a manner so as to minimize any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive, radioactive or other hazardous condition; noise or vibration, smoke, dust, odor or other form of air pollution; electrical or other disturbance; glare; liquid or solid waste refuse or wastes; or other substance, condition, or elements in a manner or amount as to adversely affect the surrounding areas.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.06.210 State Lands (PL2)
Purpose. St. Anthony's area of city impact includes lands owned by the Idaho Department of Lands. These lands are managed to provide revenues to a number of endowment beneficiaries. The department's mission is to manage Idaho's endowment assets to maximize long-term financial returns to public schools and other trust beneficiaries as well as to assist Idaho residents in regard to natural resource management. State lands differ form other public lands, managed by the forest service and BLM for example, in that they are not usually open to the public for recreational or other uses. Areas surrounding St. Anthony are currently leased for agricultural use but could be disposed of by the state for development or other use.
Permitted Uses. The City of St. Anthony will cooperate with the Idaho Department of Lands for land uses the department desires to permit on this property in the future. If the property becomes private in the future the city will rezone the property at that time for appropriate uses based on surrounding land uses and available city services.
Area Requirements and Standards. To be identified on a case by case basis through coordination with Idaho Department of Lands.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.06.220 Open Space
Open space lands are those that are desired to be maintained as natural, undeveloped open space or used for recreational uses. This area includes lands bordering public lands, river and stream corridors, and county park spaces. These spaces are important to the community and help create the rural and open character that everyone cherishes. Developed open spaces like parks, ball fields, tracks, etc. should be located in or adjacent to neighborhood centers whenever possible to further reinforce those areas as the hub for neighborhood activity.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.06.230 Open Space Zone (OS)
Purpose. The open space zone is established to recognize areas of recreational and public uses and to protect floodplains, slopes, and natural drainage ways from development that may cause or contribute to flooding, slope failures, excessive soil erosion, and sediment and water pollution of the Henry's Fork River. The floodplain is defined by the FEMA developed FIRM maps for the City of St. Anthony and development in the floodplain is regulated by Chapter 15.24 SAMC of this code.
Permitted Uses. Permitted and special uses for this zone are established in the Land Use Matrix, Table 6.3.
Area Requirements and Standards.
Project Requirements. Any construction projects taking place in this zone that are not listed as "permitted uses" shall obtain a special use permit. Details shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission for approval.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.06.240 Land Use Tables
Adoption of Land Use Tables—Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify permitted and specially permitted land uses within the City of St. Anthony in order to foster compatibility with uses in the same land use designations and to promote a measure of protection against the intrusion of the effects of incompatible land uses. The use of land is characterized by the activity for which the building, improvements or lot is designed, configured, conducted, occupied, or maintained.
Interpretation of Land Use Tables. Matrix-style land use tables that address allowable uses and standards are made part of this title and shall be interpreted consistent with the principles and rules set forth in this section.
The land use tables in this section indicate whether a specific use is allowed in a zone classification. Specific uses are divided among multiple tables, each of which represents a broad category of land uses.
If the letter "P," for "Permitted," appears in the box at the intersection of a column and a row, the use is allowed in that classification, subject to the development and operational requirements of this and other applicable ordinance provisions.
If the letter "C," for "Specially Permitted," appears in the box at the intersection of a column and a row, the use is specially allowed in that classification, subject to obtaining a special use permit and subject to the development and operational requirements of this and other applicable ordinance provisions. The responsibility of demonstrating that a special use permit request is appropriate rests with the applicant.
Uses not designated as permitted (P) or specially permitted (C) are prohibited. If neither a "P" or "C" appears in the box at the intersection of a column and a row, the use is prohibited in the zoning classification.
Any proposed use not listed in the table may be classified by the commission as a permitted use (P), special use (C), or prohibited, based on the listed use(s) to which the proposed use is most similar. If the commission determines that the proposed use is not similar to any use in the table, the proposed use shall not be permitted, however these uses may be considered using the amendment process described in Chapter 17.07 . The commission may use the standard industrial classifications (SIC) as a basis for comparing the nature of a proposed or identified use. The determination of the commission may be appealed to the city council as provided herein.

17.08.010 Special Use Permits
Special Use Permits—Standards. The purpose of this section is to establish standards and a framework of procedures for consideration of requests for special use permits. Special uses are not permitted by right in a particular zoning district but may be authorized in the use matrix set forth in Chapter 17.06 SAMC of this title, and following a public hearing provided that they comply with the standards established by this title. Conditional use as used in this title is the same as "special use" referenced in I.C. § 67-6512, as such code provision exists at the time of enactment of this title. A special use permit is not transferable from one parcel of land to another, nor shall it be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other special use permits in similar locations or circumstances. A special use permit may be issued subject to performance or compliance with conditions as outlined in this title and as addressed by the specific proposal or application.
Procedures. Special use permit requests require a public hearing before the planning and zoning commission (or hearing examiner) following appropriate procedures. Notice shall comply with legal requirements established by Idaho Code. Any decision by the planning and zoning commission may be appealed to the city council by an affected person within no more than fourteen days after the final decision of the planning and zoning commission has been rendered. Any such request to appeal must be signed by the appellant and received by the administrator within the time constraints established by this title. An appeal not timely filed shall be dismissed. Failure to appeal a decision of the planning and zoning commission to the council shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to this title.
Application Required. A completed special use permit application shall be submitted to the administrator which shall include, among other matters addressed by the application form; a description of the use proposed; the manner of implementation of the proposed use including information about appearance, materials to be used, and configuration; how it would be compatible with infrastructure and land uses, present and future; and why the proposal would be in the public interest.
Hearing and Standards of Decision. As its schedule and agenda allow the planning and zoning commission shall conduct a public hearing and shall consider testimony and other evidence and review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed special use. In considering a special use request, the planning and zoning commission may attach appropriate conditions to mitigate impacts and to ensure conformance with the intent of the comprehensive plan and applicable provisions of this title. An application for a special use permit may be approved as presented, conditionally approved with a special use permit, or denied by the planning and zoning commission upon determining the following:
Whether the proposed special use would or would not conform with the purposes and express terms of the applicable zoning district in which it would be located.
Whether the proposed use constitutes an allowable special use as established by this title for the zoning district involved, and complies with all other applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of the City of St. Anthony and the state.
Whether the proposed special use as presented will or will not be compatible with the health, safety, and welfare of the public in general and with present or future land uses in the vicinity of the proposal.
Whether the proposed special use will or will not further positive development of the vicinity in accordance with relevant policies set forth in the comprehensive plan and land use ordinances.
Conditions. When granting a special use permit, the planning and zoning commission may attach conditions and requirements specific to the proposal including, but not limited to:
Minimizing conflicts with present or future development.
Controlling the sequence and timing of development.
Controlling the duration of development.
Assuring that development is maintained properly.
Controlling the location and setbacks of development.
Requiring more restrictive standards than those generally required in the zoning ordinance for uses permitted outright. Such more restrictive standards may include, but not be limited to: additional setbacks, requiring development within time limitations, height restrictions, additional landscaping or screening, lighting restrictions, signage restrictions, selection of building or hardscape materials, location of site accesses, location of site features, prescribing site layout, circulation or grading, restricting hours of operation or activity, design limitations, circulation limits for vehicles or pedestrians, control of site drainage or area-wide drainage patterns, prescribing specific use limitations and such other features of use or site development as may be needed to enhance compatibility with use of surrounding lands and public facilities.
Decision Required. When granting or denying an application, the commission shall specify the relevant facts considered in evaluating the application, the reasons for approval or denial, and the actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a permit. The applicant will be notified of the decision in writing. A decision as to a special use permit may be appealed to the council within fourteen days of final action by the planning and zoning commission by an applicant or other affected person.
Permits and Progress Required. Unless expressly allowed to the contrary by the terms of a special use permit, if permits for development of a requested special use have not been issued within six months of the date of granting a special use permit or if development of the approved special use has not commenced with sustained effort to complete development within one year after granting approval of the special use permit, the special use permit shall become null and void, unless the planning and zoning commission or council, whichever gave final approval, has granted an extension, such extension not to exceed twelve months upon a showing of good cause by the applicant. An extension to the permit may only be granted if applied for in writing to the approving body prior to the date of expiration and if the approving body finds, upon review of the record, that an extension is warranted due to circumstances outside control of the applicant.
Violation—Revocation or Penalty.

17.08.020 Variance
A variance is a discretionary exception to the requirements of the zoning ordinance concerning bulk and placement standards such as lot area, lot coverage, width, depth, setbacks, parking location requirements, height, or any other ordinance provision affecting the size of a structure or the placement of the structure upon the property. Variances may be permitted when, due to unusual natural physical characteristics of the site, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title would result in unnecessary hardship denying an owner all reasonable use of the owner's land. An applicant for a variance bears the responsibility for demonstrating an undue hardship because of unique physical characteristics of the site, and after meeting that obligation must demonstrate that the implemented variance would not harm the public interest.
A complete application using an application form supplied by the administrator shall include a drawing of the site, a written description of the variance requested, reasons why the variance is warranted, and any supporting documents. The application will be scheduled for public hearing whenever it can be accommodated by the schedule of the hearing body.
At least one public hearing must be held before the planning and zoning commission using the hearing and notice procedure required by state law.
The planning and zoning commission shall consider the following when deciding a variance request:
Whether unvaried application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of all reasonable use of his land and whether circumstances exist that are peculiar to the natural conditions of the land in ways not generally applicable to other lands in the community.
Whether the variance, if granted, would harm the public interest by adversely affecting public safety, the environment or the legitimate interests of neighboring owners.
When granting or denying an application, the commission shall specify the relevant facts considered in evaluating the application, the reasons for approval or denial, and the actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain a permit. The applicant will be notified of the decision in writing. A variance decision may be appealed to the council within fourteen days of final action by the planning and zoning commission by an applicant or other affected person.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.08.030 Decisions By The Planning And Zoning Commission And Council; Form
All decisions made by the planning and zoning commission or council shall be made in a manner and form consistent with the requirements of Idaho law. Specifically, decisions shall be made within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days from the date of the last hearing, and shall be in writing and include: (a) Reference to the ordinance and standards used in evaluating the application; (b) The reasons for approval or denial; (c) The actions, if any, that the applicant could take to obtain approval, and (d) Notice to the applicant regarding the applicant's right to request a regulatory taking analysis. Decisions that are deemed quasi-judicial shall identify relevant facts and provisions of law that lead to the conclusion reached. In recognition that such requirements may change from time to time by virtue of judicial decision and legislative enactment, decision-makers are referred to relevant provisions of state law for guidance in shaping decisions required by this title.
All decisions that are deemed legislative decisions by requirements of state law shall be undertaken in the same manner that legislative decisions are typically made.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.08.040 Temporary Use Permit
A temporary use is a land use established for a period of time not to exceed thirty to ninety days in a calendar year, depending on the nature of the use, and does not require permanent site improvements. Unless a temporary use permit has been approved pursuant to ordinances of the City of St. Anthony, establishment of any land use will be presumed to require compliance with all applicable provisions of this title.

Temporary uses may be allowed in appropriately zoned areas without full site development as otherwise required by this title. Such uses may include, but are not limited to, erection of temporary structures such as tents, fences, booths or parking of trailers for activities such as carnivals, circuses, fairs, religious meetings, temporary outdoor displays and/or sale of Christmas trees, art objects or other items and other similar activities conducted either outdoors or within temporary structures. The actual use embodied by a temporary use permit must be a permitted use in the zoning district in which it is proposed to be located. The temporary use permit may be allowed subject to conditions required by the administrator so long as the administrator determines that granting the temporary use permit will not harm the public interest if the required conditions are complied with.

An application for a temporary use shall include a written description of the use, proposed starting date of the use, and a drawing of the site that shows the location of the use, access, setbacks from property lines, parking, restroom facilities (if applicable), and any other pertinent information that the administrator may require to evaluate the use. An application for a temporary use with a duration in excess of thirty days shall include the names and addresses of abutting land owners. The administrator will prepare a notice of the administrative permit request and mail it to abutting property owners who will have seven days from the date of mailing within which to respond with written comments supporting or opposing the request.
A temporary use may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied by the administrator or if the administrator chooses it may be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission for approval. A temporary use permit is valid on the date of approval or on the date requested by the applicant and will be valid for the time period requested or no more than ninety days during a calendar year, such days to be designated at the time of issuance. The administrator or commission, when deciding a temporary use permit request, should consider the following:
Whether the proposed temporary use would be consistent with the general policies of the zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan.
Whether the use would otherwise be permitted within the zoning district wherein located.
Whether granting the temporary use permit would be detrimental to the nearby neighborhood or to the community in general.
Whether the proposed temporary use would create a traffic hazard.
Whether the proposed temporary use would impair the functioning of community facilities or delivery of public services.
Provisions for temporary use of RVs or campers. The parking and use of a recreational vehicle or camper may be permitted as a temporary use to accommodate visitors on a residential lot subject to the following restrictions:
The total length of time an RV or camper may be located on a lot to accommodate visitors shall not exceed fourteen days during one calendar year. (This shall not apply to the storage of a personal RV or camper by the owner of the property when it is not occupied.)
The location of the camper or RV shall not block the clear vision triangle established in Section 17.09.010(A) SAMC, nor shall it be placed in any street or public right-of-way, including sidewalks, or impede pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic.
The use of the RV or camper shall not result in any sanitary or public health concerns nor utilize public/city-maintained water or wastewater systems for service or disposal of wastewater or the use of private dumpsters for garbage disposal.
The use of the RV or camper shall not result in a violation of the noise restrictions established in Section 17.09.020 SAMC.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.08.050 Home Occupation Permits
Certain limited business or professional uses may be conducted as a home occupation within a residential dwelling as a permitted land use subject to specific limitations established to maintain compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhood. Examples of permissible use types include home offices, home child care, handicrafts, computer activities, tailoring, barber/hair salon or similar businesses. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for home occupations that retain and do not disturb the residential character of a neighborhood.
Before establishing a home occupation, an application fee must be paid and an application must be approved by the administrator, in response to an application which addresses necessary information to demonstrate compliance with this title in addition to providing an accurate and concise description of the requested home occupation.
The administrator will review the application materials and may grant, grant with conditions, or deny a home occupation permit upon finding that the home occupation will not change the character of the neighborhood or create a nuisance (noise, dust, odor, excessive traffic, etc.) and that it complies with the standards established by this title. The administrator will review the application to determine that the use will meet the home occupation standards addressed by this title. A permit may be revoked or a enforcement actions taken for noncompliance with ordinance standards or conditions of approval.

A decision by the administrator may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission and thereafter to the council respectively, in accordance with procedures established by this title. A home occupation permit is non-transferable and is valid so long as there is compliance with the conditions of approval issued with the permit and home occupation standards set forth herein are met.

Home Occupation Performance Standards. All home occupations shall comply with the following standards, in addition to the site-specific conditions required by the administrator:
The home occupation is conducted entirely within the dwelling and an accessory building, and is carried on by members of the family residing in the building with no more than one additional employee outside of the resident family.
The home occupation is clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for dwelling purposes and does not change the character of the building from that of a dwelling.
Signs are limited to one non-flashing, non-neon, sign not larger in area than two square feet. If lighted, the lighting shall be indirect. See Chapter 15.20 SAMC of this code for other restrictions.
Not more than the equivalent of twenty-five percent of the ground floor area of the dwelling is devoted to the home occupation.
The activities in connection with the home occupation including the regular sale of goods on the premises shall not lead to an increase in traffic which creates parking concerns or a nuisance in a residential neighborhood.
Home occupations are subject to the requirements of the city for business licenses (see chapter 5.12 SAMC). Any other commercial activities conducted on residential lots outside of these above listed parameters must be addressed as special use applications.

17.09.010 Performance Standards For Land Uses
The purpose of this section is to provide performance standards that protect the community and environment through proper site development and thereby achieve conformance with the regulations found in this title and other provisions of applicable law. The following performance standards apply to developments in all zoning districts and are supplemental to requirements established thereby:

Vision Triangle. Visibility shall be maintained at all intersections of city streets by maintaining an unobstructed view between three and ten vertical feet within a right triangle, whose sides adjacent to the intersecting right-of-way lines are forty feet in length in compliance with Idaho Code § 49-221, or its successor.
Temporary Construction Facilities. Temporary buildings, trailers, equipment and materials used in conjunction with construction work, may be permitted in any district during the construction period. Any such temporary installations shall comply with basic safety and sanitation standards and not create a hazard or significant detriment to neighboring lands. Temporary facilities shall be removed upon completion of the construction work or upon expiration of the building or construction permit.
Dangerous or Nuisance Conditions. No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any manner creating dangerous, injurious, or noxious conditions that may adversely affect the neighborhood or adjoining premises. Noncompliance with nuisance statutes, building, fire or life safety codes shall not be excused merely because the land use does not violate this title.
Glare/Exterior Lighting Shielding/Redirection Required. No interior or exterior lighting shall create, direct, or reflect glare which will adversely affect any surrounding property nor shall such lighting adversely affect vision on nearby public streets, public walkways or other rights-of-way. It shall be the duty of any landowner to direct or shield lighting to avoid impacts on neighboring lands or land uses. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this title.
Street Right-of-Way Dedication and Frontage Improvements Required. Additional street rights-of-way as established by approved transportation plans or by ordinance standards and construction of frontage improvements is required at the time of establishment of any use, any development of a new land use or expansion of an existing land use by thirty-three percent or more in floor area. Street improvements shall include widening or extension of base and pavement, curb, gutter, sidewalk, water lines, sewer lines, street lighting and drainage facilities. Right-of-way dedication shall conform to the transportation element of the comprehensive plan or a specific transportation plan, the city's capital improvements plan, or as otherwise required by the public works superintendent or designee pursuant to review or other ordinance-specified procedures. All such requirements must be reasonably related to and proportional to the impact of the development on the infrastructure of the community. It shall be the responsibility of the developer of any parcel of land to extend water and sewer utilities across the full width of any frontage in order to maintain continuity of public systems.
Utility Line Placement. All wire, fiber optic or cable utility service lines shall be placed underground. The administrator may waive this requirement if the use is temporary in nature or if there are practical physical difficulties that make compliance impossible.
Surfacing—Residential and Commercial/Industrial. All required residential access drives and parking areas shall be surfaced with Portland cement concrete or asphalt paving. All required commercial/industrial access drives, maneuvering areas and parking areas, outdoor merchandise display areas and motorized vehicle display lots shall be surfaced with concrete or asphalt paving. Surfacing material shall be designed for the loading anticipated. Actual load design for commercial/industrial uses will be determined during application review. Outdoor storage areas in the industrial zone for storage of production materials shall be surfaced with all-weather materials and shall be enclosed within a sight screening fence.
Water Supply and Sewage Disposal. The method of water supply and sewage disposal for all land uses must comply with city and other applicable state codes.
Dust Control. During all on-site grading and construction activities, adequate measures shall be implemented to control dust in order to prevent a blowing dust nuisance. Methods for dust control may be specified at application review. The administrator may issue a stop-work order on any development project that demonstrates an inability to control dust until an acceptable dust control program is implemented.
Architectural Projections. Open structures such as decks, porches, canopies, balconies, platforms, carports, covered patios and similar architectural projections shall be considered parts of the building to which attached or accessory buildings if detached and shall not project into the required minimum front, side or rear yard setbacks.
Height Regulation Exceptions. The height limitations contained in this title do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, antennas, ventilators, chimneys or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy except where the height of such structures will constitute a hazard to the safe landing and takeoff of aircraft at an established airport. City utility and public service structures are generally excepted from height restrictions.
Fences (Including Walls and Landscaping). All walls, hedges and fences shall not exceed three feet in height within the required front yard setback and nor shall they exceed six feet in height in the rear and side yard setback areas. Corner lots which abut the side yard of an adjoining lot may not block visibility of a driveway on the adjoining lot above three feet with a rear or side yard fence. Fences shall not violate the vision triangle requirements of I.C. § 49-221, or its successor.
Solid Waste Screening. All solid waste collection areas or facilities shall be enclosed on at least three sides by a sight-obscuring wall or fence tall enough to shield any bulk solid waste container or shall be stored within an enclosed building or structure. Adequate vehicular access shall be provided to allow use of the container.
Outside Storage and Screening. Outside storage areas in commercial or industrial zones must be screened from public view by sight obscuring fences, walls, berms, or a combination of these, as approved by the administrator. The administrator may approve alternative methods of reducing the visual impact in lieu of screening, or waive the requirements if visual impact is of no consequence.
Factory-Built Commercial Structures. All factory-built commercial structures must be located in commercial zones. Factory-built commercial structures may also be allowed in conjunction with a school provided that site development requirements for site-built structures are maintained. Factory-built commercial structures may be used temporarily in other zones in conjunction with construction, and must be removed upon completion of such construction.
Buffering Residential Interface. Buffering between commercial/industrial land uses and residential zones shall be the responsibility of the developer of the commercial/industrial site. If the zoning ordinance does not otherwise provide specific standards, the commercial industrial site shall otherwise provide a setback from an adjacent residential zoning boundary or from existing residential lands no less than twenty-five feet or the height of the commercial industrial structure, whichever is greater. Such interface shall be screened by evergreen landscaping and fencing that is continuous and serves as an effective buffer against sound and light. Such obligation shall not apply retroactively to an existing commercial/industrial use.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.09.020 Maximum Sound Levels
No application that creates excessive levels of sound beyond its property line shall be permitted. Excessive sound, measured at the property line of the receiving use, exceeds the standards of Table 9.1.

Table 9.1—Detailed Performance Standards for Noise

Receiving Use	Maximum Sound Level
Residential	60 dBA, 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.	50 dBA, 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
Commercial, industrial	70 dBA, any time
Note: dBA is the measure of sound levels in A-weighted decibels.

Applicability. This performance standard applies to sounds generated by the use or operation of an application, including sound generated by the operation of trains, motor vehicles, and heavy equipment on the site. It does not apply to the movement of trains on existing railroad rights-of-way, the movement of motor vehicle on public roads, the operation of farm machinery, the operation of watercraft, or other sources of noise that are not attributable to a particular application.
Temporary Exception. The maximum sound levels of Table 9.1. may be exceeded by temporary construction and maintenance activities, but any excessive noise generated by such activities shall be restricted to the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Special community events and aircraft use shall be exempt from these requirements.
Noise levels shall be measured at the property line with a calibrated noise meter or similar device capable of accurate measurement of sound. Until such time that the city, local law enforcement agencies, or another entity shall be designated to make measurements or noise for the purpose of enforcing this title, it shall be the property owners responsibility to obtain a measure of the noise generated by activities on the site by an independent business or technician with the capabilities and equipment to make such measurements and which shall be submitted to the city from the entity making measurement.

17.09.040 Off-Street Parking Requirements
General Requirements. Off-street parking, loading spaces, and display lots shall be provided for facilities, or portions thereof constructed, newly established, reconstructed, or moved onto a lot after the effective date of the ordinance from which this title was derived. The required off-street parking, loading spaces, and display lots shall be developed and maintained according to the applicable provisions of this zoning ordinance. The administrator is empowered to determine the regulations and standards to be required in each particular circumstance, considering the long-term needs of the facility constructed. Land uses in existence prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this title was derived may be continued as a nonconforming use subject to other provisions of this title concerning provision of off-street parking.
Change of Use or Increase of Space. Except for alterations or additions to individual dwelling units, parking spaces meeting the requirements of this chapter shall be provided whenever the use of a facility is changed to a higher parking category or if the facility floor area is increased by more than ten percent in any five years. Neither the number, size, location nor maintenance of existing parking and loading spaces shall be altered or reduced below the requirements and standards specified for the use in this chapter. Whenever an individual lot or parcel has a facility with more than one use or activity requiring different spaces for parking and loading, the sum of the required spaces for each use or activity shall be used in determining the overall requirements.
Street Parking Excluded. No portion of any public right-of-way shall be used in satisfying the minimum parking requirements established by this title.
Front-to-Back (Tandem) Parking Prohibited. Except for detached single-family dwelling units, the design and development of front-to-back parking and loading spaces shall not be allowed in meeting the minimum space requirements of this chapter. A required space shall not be blocked by another space such that a vehicle would be required to enter and leave a space by having to cross another required space.
Maintenance of Parking and Loading Areas. All paved areas intended for use by the public and required by this chapter shall be maintained on a regular basis. Regular maintenance shall include, but not be limited to, pavement repair and seal coating; pavement marking and striping; removal of dust, leaves and litter; removal of snow and ice; maintaining landscaped areas; and maintaining signs, fences, wheel stops, curbs, walks, drainage facilities and any other appurtenances pertinent to the requirements of this chapter and the subdivision ordinance.
Off-Site or Shared Parking. Whenever any required parking or loading areas are located on a site which is not within the property limits of the facility being served, the permit applicant shall present an agreement authorizing use of the off-site parking for the duration of use of the site. Such agreement shall be subject to approval by the administrator. The primary considerations for such approval shall be the functionality of the parking spaces, the safety of parking users and the effects on neighboring land uses. Any change in use or increase in use during the term of the agreement shall require re-evaluation of the conditions and factors upon which the agreement was based.
Parking Spaces Must Be Available. Required off-street parking areas shall not be used for any purpose that would at any time prevent their intended use as parking spaces by occupants and patrons of the facility being served. No required parking area may be used for both parking and loading.
Ordinance Procedure—Required Spaces Determined by Administrator. Where this title requires the administrator to prescribe the number of parking and loading spaces, the administrator shall base his/her determination on the following:
Traffic generation, giving particular attention to attendance potential at any facility.
Location of the facility and the peak hours of operation.
Extent and frequency of loading/unloading operations.
The number of employees during peak period.
Any other factors that would affect parking and loading requirements.
ADA Accessible Parking Spaces. Where off-street parking spaces are required by this title there shall also be required parking spaces for persons with disabilities as provided in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These spaces shall be located as near as practical to a primary accessible entrance.
Off-Street Parking and Loading Area Standards. The layout and design of off-street parking and loading areas established hereafter shall meet the requirements of this title.
Parking Space Sizes. Off-street parking spaces shall meet the minimum dimensions for the following types of spaces and conditions:
Standard ninety degree non-parallel parking spaces shall be ten feet wide by twenty feet long.
Parallel parking spaces shall be nine feet wide by twenty-three feet long for all vehicles.
Where a side of a parking area abuts a building or other obstruction, additional width shall be added to the adjacent parking spaces to allow turning movements.
Proximity to Use. The distance between parking areas and the use being served shall not exceed the following:
Residential: On-site.
Civic, Commercial and Service: Not farther than two hundred feet from the entrance to the facility being served with continuity to adjoining lots.
Wholesale and Industrial: Not farther than three hundred feet from the entrance to the facility being served unless continuous parking is provided.
Zoning: All off-site parking must be located in a zoning district that permits the use the parking serves.
Aisles and Driveways for Maneuvering. All required off-street parking spaces and loading berths shall be designed with adequate space to accommodate the turning movements of the vehicles entering and leaving the facility. Space shall be provided such that all vehicles shall enter and leave the public right-of-way in a forward direction. This requirement shall not apply to residential parking areas that serve two or fewer dwelling units. The location and design of approaches to parking lots shall be approved by the public works superintendent or designee.
Parking Area Grades/Drainage. All off-street parking shall be paved such that no surface shall exceed five percent and no longitudinal drainage gradient shall be flatter than one-half percent. Approach grades shall be safe and convenient. Parking spaces for persons with disabilities shall be as level as possible but in no case shall the parking space, adjacent aisle, driveway or designated pathways exceed a gradient of two percent in any direction. All parking and loading areas shall provide for proper drainage of surface water to approved drainage areas or structures. Surface drainage shall be retained on-site to the extent that site run-off shall not exceed run-off from the site in its undeveloped condition.
Paving of Parking and Loading Areas. All driveways, parking, loading and maneuvering areas required of this chapter shall be paved with hot asphalt, Portland cement concrete, or approved paving blocks or bricks. Single-family and duplex family uses shall be served by a paved driveway and parking spaces as required.
Paving of Display Lots. Display lots for vehicles shall be paved as shall approaches, driveways, maneuvering areas and parking spaces. The actual area used for the display of the homes, nursery stock or heavy equipment may be surfaced with compacted crushed aggregate, provided that the unpaved area is maintained in a neat, dustless and weedless condition.
Lighting. The illumination of off-street parking and loading areas and display lots shall be designed such that lighting is directed away from the street and adjacent properties and toward the interior of the property focusing on the ground to be illuminated.
Widths of Driveways, Parking Aisles and Turning Radii. The city's parking requirements shall be considered to be minimum standards. All off-street parking areas shall be submitted for review by the local fire department or designated fire marshal who may require wider driveways and parking aisles and larger vehicular turning radii as prescribed by the applicable fire code.
Irrigation. All landscaped areas including buffer strips and drainage infiltration facilities shall be maintained.
Dimensional Requirements. With the exception of residential parking areas that serve two or fewer dwelling units all other off-street parking areas shall be laid out and designed to satisfy the following requirements:
Traffic Lane Widths. The minimum driveway and approach widths shall be determined from the operating speed and the classification of the street providing access, the volume of traffic being generated, the potential for truck use, and fire protection requirements. Parking aisle widths shall vary with the angle of vehicular turning required to access the required space on one-way aisles, but shall be a minimum of twenty-four feet wide on two-way aisles. The maximum two-way approach and driveway width shall be forty feet where it can be demonstrated that generated traffic warrants a separate left turn lane for vehicles exiting the parking area and entering a public right-of-way. A forty-foot wide approach may also be allowed where heavy truck use prevails.
Exit Vehicle Space. There shall be at least twenty-four feet separating a parking aisle from the edge of the adjacent street to provide space for one exiting vehicle.
Striping. Each parking space shall be delineated with clearly marked pavement striping. Other pavement markings for spaces for persons with disabilities, pathways, crosswalks, stop bars, delineations, turning arrows, bicycles, etc., may be required.

Mediation may be requested in writing by any applicant or affected person, or by the mayor, administrator, planning and zoning commission or the council, during the course of any quasi-judicial matter, but in any case no later than fourteen days after entry of a final decision and prior to any person filing a petition for judicial review.
The parties to any mediation application shall participate in at least one mediation session if mediation is authorized by either the planning and zoning commission or the council. The parties shall agree upon a mediator and shall share the cost of mediation equally.
After completion of the initial mediation session, an applicant or otherwise affected party may decline to participate in mediation that has been proposed by the city.
Upon request for mediation and until at least one mediation session has been held, any time limitation relevant to the application made on the basis of such mediation shall be tolled. Such tolling shall cease when the council determines that the mediation should cease through their official action or where no mediation session is scheduled for at least twenty-eight days from the date of a mediation request. A subsequent public hearing must be held before the council where mediated resolution results in recommended change(s) to an application.
The mediation process shall not be part of the official record regarding consideration of the application upon which the mediation is based.

17.10.020 Exhaustion Of Administrative Procedures Required
Any procedure addressed by this title that authorizes the planning and zoning commission to make a decision, as contrasted with a recommendation to the council, shall not be deemed a final decision unless it has been appealed to the council by the party seeking to bring a judicial appeal. Any such appeal must be filed with the administrator within fourteen days after the date of the decision entered by the planning and zoning commission. Any such appeal must be accompanied by the filing fee established by resolution of the council and a completed appeal application as provided by the administrator. Any such appeal shall be decided by the council within one hundred eighty days of the date it is filed with the administrator. Failure to file such an appeal shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to seeking a court review of proceedings.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.10.030 Legal Nonconforming Structures
A legal nonconforming structure is one that was in compliance with all land use and building code requirements at the time it was constructed, or that was constructed or established before land use regulations were enacted, but does not conform to the structure requirements of the current land use codes of the city. It is the policy of the city to encourage maintenance and continued vitality of existing legal nonconforming structures until a change of land use is undertaken by the owner in conformance with requirements of the zoning ordinance.
Any legal nonconforming permanent structure may continue to be used and maintained as otherwise allowed by this title. A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged in area in any way that increases its nonconformity. A structure used to house a nonconforming nonresidential use may be enlarged, subject to all required building permits, by up to ten percent of its square footage so long as any such enlargement does not increase the nonconformity of any setbacks or building bulk regulations.
A damaged or destroyed legal nonconforming structure may be repaired or reconstructed subject to all required building permits, provided that the extent of the previously existing nonconformance is not increased.
Any structure legally built prior to the adoption of land use regulations within a currently required yard setback area shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure and the nonconforming dimension shall not be expanded by additional construction, unless otherwise qualifying for a variance.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.10.040 Legal Nonconforming Uses
All existing uses of land that are not permitted uses in the zoning district in which such use is being conducted, and all uses which, if presently initiated, would require a special use permit, and which do not have a special use permit, are deemed legal nonconforming uses. Legal nonconforming uses shall not be expanded or extended in any way, except as otherwise expressly allowed by this title. A legal nonconforming use shall not be changed except to a use that complies with the regulations of the zoning district in which the subject property lies or to diminish its nonconformity.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.10.050 Legal Nonconforming Lots
All existing platted subdivision lots that do not meet the minimum lot area and dimension standards of the district within which they are located are hereby deemed nonconforming lots. Any lot that was legally created prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this title was derived may be used in conformance with the uses permitted by the zoning district with in which it is located, provided that all yard and setback requirements are met. If lot area is deficient in a residential zone by no more than fifty percent, any such nonconforming lot may be used only for construction of a detached single-family dwelling. Undeveloped, nonconforming lots of at least fifty percent of the minimum required lot area may be used and have a single-family structure erected upon them.
No nonconforming or conforming lot shall be reduced in area or dimensions if such reduction would result in a greater degree of nonconformity. In the least dense residential district in the city's jurisdiction, any lot with an area less than the minimum required for the least dense residential district may only be developed to the minimum residential use allowed in the zone. Any lot in any residential district that has an area less than the minimum square footage desired, but at least fifty percent of the minimum area, unless it adjoins one or more substandard lots held in common ownership, may only be developed with a single-family dwelling unit.
The administrator is authorized to take such steps as are necessary, to abate, penalize or prevent the use of any unlawful structure, lot or use through the provisions of Chapter 17.11 SAMC of this title.

17.12.010 What This Chapter Does
The purpose of the airport overlay zoning district (AOZD) is to provide for the safety of aircraft pilots and passengers and protect a substantial investment of public funds by assuring that land application and construction activities within the AOZD are compatible with the safe, continued use of the airports serving Fremont County.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.12.020 Height Limitation Zones
The AOZD is composed of several height limitation zones, which include all land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces appurtenant to Stanford Field and the Henry's Lake Airfield. These zones are shown on supplements to the official zoning map of the city. An area located in more than one of these zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.

Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. The inner edge of the approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is two hundred fifty feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand feet from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
Conical Zone. The conical zone is the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of four thousand feet.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.12.030 Height Limitations
No structure or tree shall be allowed to exceed the height limitations established here.

Utility Runway Visual Approach Zone. Slopes twenty feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand feet along the extended runway centerline.
Transitional Zones. Slope seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation. In addition, there are transitional sloping seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface.
Horizontal Zone. One hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation.
Conical Zone. Slopes twenty feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the edge of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation, and extending to a height of three hundred fifty feet above the airport elevation.
Exception from Height Limitations. Nothing in this title shall prohibit the construction or maintenance of any structure of thirty feet or less in height, or the growth of any tree to a height up to thirty feet above the surface of the land within the horizontal and conical zones.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.12.040 Use Restrictions
No use within any zone established by this chapter shall create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or in any way endanger or interfere with the operation of aircraft.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.12.050 Permits - Additional Requirements
Permit requirements for all application activity are established in Chapter 17.03 SAMC. Within the AOZD, permit requirements shall be expanded to include the planting of any tree with a growth habit of more than thirty feet and the construction of any building or structure that is more than thirty feet in height and is exempted from the requirement for a permit. This includes agricultural outbuildings and similar accessory structures, except as follows:

Within the horizontal and conical zones: No permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet, or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height, except when, because of topographic features, such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones;
Within the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred feet from each end of the runway: No permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet, or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height, except when, because of topographic features, such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones; and
In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones, but beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone: No permit shall be required for trees with a growth habit of less than thirty feet, or for exempt structures of less than thirty feet in height, except when, because of topographic features, such a tree or structure would extend above the height limits for those zones.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.12.060 Variances - Additional Requirements
The variance procedure is described in Section 17.08.020 SAMC. Any application for a variance of the height limitations established in this chapter shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace.

(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)
17.12.070 Nonconforming Uses; Additional Requirements
Nonconforming uses and buildings are regulated by these provisions within the AOZD, according to these requirements in addition to those of Sections 17.10.030 SAMC —17.10.040 SAMC.

Nonconforming uses within the AOZD, may include trees, and shall be required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance of any markers and/or lights the city or airport board deems necessary to indicate their presence to the operators of aircraft. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the city or airport board.
The repair and, under specified circumstances, replacement of nonconforming uses and buildings permitted by this title, including any building, or tree shall not be permitted to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived.
(Ord. No. 2015-01, § 2, 2-26-2015)

17.12.080 Obstruction Marking And Lighting
The approval of any application for a permit or variance may be conditioned on the installation, operation, and maintenance, at the owner's expense, of the markings and/or lights necessary to indicate the presence of an obstruction to aircraft pilots.
