provided in section 1-1-3 of this chapter under the direction of the village clerk and village
attorney, acting for the village board. Any reference to the number of any section contained
herein shall be understood to refer to the position of the same number, its appropriate
chapter and title heading, and to the general penalty clause relating thereto, as well as to
the section itself, when reference is made to this village code by title in any legal document.

CHAPTER 2
SAVING CLAUSE
1-2-1 REPEAL OF GENERAL ORDINANCES
All general ordinances of the village passed prior to the adoption of this village code are
hereby repealed, except those included in this village code or those by necessary
implication that are reserved from repeal (subject to the saving clauses contained in the
following sections), and excluding the following ordinances which are not repealed: tax
levy ordinances; appropriation ordinances; ordinances relating to boundaries and
annexations; franchise ordinances and other ordinances granting special rights to persons
or corporations; contract ordinances and ordinances authorizing the execution of a
contract or the issuance of warrants; salary ordinances; ordinances establishing, naming
or vacating streets, alleys or other public places; improvement ordinances; bond
ordinances; ordinances relating to elections; ordinances relating to the transfer or
acceptance of real estate by or from the village; and all special ordinances.
1-2-2 COURT PROCEEDINGS
No new ordinance shall be construed or held to repeal a former ordinance, whether such
former ordinance is expressly repealed or not, as to any offense committed against such
former ordinance or as to any act done, any penalty, forfeiture or punishment so incurred,
or any right accrued or claim arising under the former ordinance, or in any way whatever
to affect any such offense or act so committed or so done, or any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment so incurred or any right accrued or claim arising before the new ordinance
takes effect, save only that proceedings thereafter shall conform to the ordinance in force
at the time of such proceeding, so far as practicable. If any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment be mitigated by any provision of a new ordinance, such provision may be, by
the consent of the party affected, applied to any judgment announced after the new
ordinance takes effect.
This section shall extend to all repeals, either by express words or implication, whether
the repeal is in the ordinance making any new provisions upon the same subject or in any
other ordinance.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed as abating any action now pending
under or by virtue of any general ordinance of the village herein repealed and the
provisions of all general ordinances contained in this code shall be deemed to be
continuing provisions and not a new enactment of the same provision; nor shall this
chapter be deemed as discontinuing, abating, modifying or altering any penalty accrued
or to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, firm or corporation, or as waiving
any right of the village under any ordinance or provision thereof in force at the time of
adoption of this village code.
1-2-3 SEVERABILITY CLAUSE
If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
village code or any part thereof is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or invalid or
ineffective by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity
or effectiveness of the remaining portions of this code, or any part thereof. The village
board hereby declares that it would have passed each section, subsection, subdivision,
paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more
sections, subsections, subdivisions, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases be
declared unconstitutional, invalid or ineffective.

seeking administrative review of a final decision shall be required to reimburse
the Village for the costs of preparing and certifying the record of proceedings.
The failure of the person seeking administrative review to reimburse the Village

reverses the findings, decision or order of the hearing officer, the Village shall
reimburse the respondent for the costs for preparing and certifying the record

Procedure (735 ILCS 5/12-101 et seq.) or by the Uniform Commercial Code, a
lien shall be imposed on the real estate or personal estate, or both, of the person

imposed with respect to any transaction in interstate commerce or
otherwise to the extent to which the business or privilege may not, under
the constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of
taxation by this state or any political subdivision thereof; nor shall any
persons engaged in the business of distributing, supplying, furnishing, or
selling or transmitting gas, water, or electricity, or engaged in the
business of transmitting messages, or using or consuming electricity
acquired in a purchase at retail, be subject to taxation under the

same class in the municipality, whether privately or municipally owned or
operated, or exercising the same privilege within the municipality.
Additional Taxes: Such tax shall be in addition to other taxes levied upon
the taxpayer or its business.
b. Collection: The tax authorized by this subsection F shall be collected from
the purchaser by a person maintaining a place of business in this state

debt of the purchaser to the person who delivers the electricity to the

and who is not otherwise exempted from paying such tax shall make a
return to the village treasurer for the preceding month stating:
(1) His name.
(2) His principal place of business.
(3) His gross receipts and/or kilowatt hour usage during the month
upon the basis of which the tax is imposed.
(4) Amount of tax.
(5) Such other reasonable and related information as the corporate
authorities may require.
The taxpayer making the return herein provided for shall, at the
time of making such return, pay to the Village, the amount of tax
herein imposed; provided that in connection with any return, the
taxpayer may, if he so elects, report and pay an amount based
upon his total billings of business subject to the tax during the
period for which the return is made (exclusive of any amounts
previously billed) with prompt adjustments based upon any
differences between such billings, and the taxable gross receipts.
e. Credit For Overpayment: If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been
paid which was not due under the provisions of this subsection F, whether
as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law then such amount shall
be credited against any tax due, or to become due, under this subsection
F from the taxpayer who made the erroneous payment; provided that no
amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years prior to the filing of a
claim therefor shall be so credited. No action to recover any amount of tax
due under the provisions of this subsection F shall be commenced more
than three (3) years after the due date of such amount.

fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of this
subsection F is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be fined in the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance
schedule contained in section 1-16-3 of this code, and in addition, shall
be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due.
g. Unconstitutionality: In the event that public act 90-561 is declared
unconstitutional, or if this subsection F is voided by court action, the
provisions of subsection A of this section (commonly known as the gross
receipts utility tax) shall remain in effect in all respects as if it had never
been amended by this subsection F, and any amounts paid to the Village
by any person delivering electricity pursuant to this subsection F shall be
deemed to have been paid pursuant to the gross receipts utility tax as it
existed prior to the passage of this subsection F.

(20%) of the total tax due for the applicable reporting period for which the
return was required to be filed. A late filing or payment penalty shall not
apply if a failure to file penalty is imposed by the controlling ordinance.
L. Abatement: The local tax administrator shall have the authority to waive or abate
any late filing penalty, late payment penalty or failure to file penalty if the local tax
administrator shall determine reasonable cause exists for delay or failure to make
a filing.
M. Installment Contracts: The village may enter into an installment contract with the
taxpayer for the payment of taxes under the controlling tax ordinance. The local
tax administrator may not cancel any installment contract so entered unless the
taxpayer fails to pay any amount due and owing. Upon written notice by the local
tax administrator that the payment is thirty (30) days delinquent, the taxpayer shall
have fourteen (14) working days to cure any delinquency. If the taxpayer fails to
cure the delinquency within the fourteen (14) day period or fails to demonstrate
good faith in restructuring the installment contract with the local administrator, the
installment contract shall be canceled without further notice to the taxpayer.
N. Statute of Limitations: The Village, through the local tax administrator, shall review
all tax returns owing in a prompt and timely manner and inform taxpayers of any
amounts due and owing. The taxpayer shall have forty five (45) days after
receiving notice of the reviewed tax returns to make any request for refund or
provide any tax still due and owing.
1. No determination of tax due and owing may be issued more than two (2)
years after the end of the calendar year for which the return for the
applicable period was filed or for the calendar year in which the return for
the applicable period was due, whichever occurs later.
2. If any tax return is not filed or if during any four (4) year period for which a
notice of tax determination or assessment may be issued by the Village,
the tax paid was less than seventy five percent (75%) of the tax due, the
statute of limitations shall be six (6) years maximum after the end of the
calendar year in which return for the applicable period was due or end of
the calendar year in which the return for the applicable period was filed.
3. No statute of limitations shall apply if a fraudulent tax return was filed by
the taxpayer.
O. Voluntary Disclosure: For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a
taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment
from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the
local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a
voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along
with interest of one percent (1%) per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the
application but not more than four (4) years before the date of filing the application.
A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any
additional tax, interest or penalty for any period before the date the application was
filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of
tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest
on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part
of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void.
The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days
after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the
local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an
underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid
within ninety (90) days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals
of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator,
whichever is longer.
P. Publication of Tax Ordinances: Any locally administered tax ordinance shall be
published via normal or standard publishing requirements. The posting of a tax
ordinance on the Internet shall satisfy the publication requirements. Copies of all
tax ordinances shall be made available to the public upon request at the Village
clerk's office.
O. Internal Review Procedure: The local tax administrator shall establish an internal
review procedure regarding any liens against any taxpayers for unpaid taxes. Upon
a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien shall
remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax
administrator shall:
1. Timely remove the lien at the Village's expense;
2. Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and
3. Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.
R. Application: This section shall be liberally construed and administered to
supplement all of the Village's tax ordinances. To the extent that any tax
ordinance is in conflict with or inconsistent with this section, this section shall be
controlling.

CHAPTER 3
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS LICENSING
3-3-1 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS
A. Title: This chapter shall be known as and may be cited as the ISLAND LAKE SEXUALLY
ORIENTED BUSINESS LICENSING ORDINANCE, and is also referred to herein as this
chapter.
B. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the
municipality in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the municipality.
The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including sexually
oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose nor effect of this chapter to restrict or
deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the first amendment, or
to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended
market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the
distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene.
C. Findings: Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses presented to the municipality from findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v.
Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini
Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), Berg v. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir.
1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir. 1982); Bamon Corp. v. City of
Dayton, 730 F.Supp 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990); and EWAP Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App.
3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979); and on studies in other cities including the "Report Of The
Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses"
(Minnesota, 1989); "Memorandum Re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance", of the assistant chief of
police of Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., "Report To The American
Center For Law And Justice On The Secondary Impacts Of Sex Oriented Businesses" (March
31, 1996); "Adult Entertainment Businesses In Indianapolis, An Analysis" (1984) and McCleary,
Richard, Ph.D., and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., "Final Report To The City Of Garden Grove: The
Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations On Garden Grove Boulevard"
(Garden Grove, California, October 23, 1991); this legislative body finds:
1. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy
activities.
2. Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented
businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for
viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in
spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
3. Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities
creates unhealthy conditions.
4. Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because
of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their
facilities.
5. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of
sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from
public view.
6. The findings noted in subsections C1 through C5 of this section raise compelling and
substantial governmental concerns.
7. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably
regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns.
8. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that
reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses.
Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on
operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the
health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
municipality. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the
actual operator of the sexually oriented business, and fully in possession and control of the
premises and activities occurring therein.
9. The regulation of nudity, semi-nudity, and physical contact between employees and
patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial
governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex related crimes, including
illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
10. Requiring open sightlines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting
will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal
and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws,
thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
11. The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to
day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses, and by employees of
such businesses, will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other
federal, state and local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial
government interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
12. A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate
individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business.
13. Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented
businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission
of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases.

infrastructure maintenance fee. Any underpayment of the amount of the Village
infrastructure maintenance fee due to the Village by the telecommunications
retailer shall be paid to the Village plus five percent (5%) of the total amount of
the underpayment determined in an audit, plus any costs incurred by the Village
in conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five percent (5%) of the total

4-4-10 BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURE
A. Bills: The water service charges shall be billed on a quarterly basis. Bills for water
services shall be sent to the owner(s) or occupant(s) of premises served. The owner
of the premises, the occupant thereof, and the user of the service shall be jointly and
severally liable to pay for the service on such premises, and the service is furnished
to the premises by the Village only on the condition that the owner of the premises,
occupant, and user of the service are jointly and severally liable therefor to the
Village.
Bills for service, or for services, if more than one dwelling unit is served through a
single meter, shall be rendered quarterly, during the month succeeding the period
for which the service is billed; provided, however, the Village may elect to bill all
consumers using in excess of one hundred thousand (100,000) gallons per quarter
on a monthly basis. Consumers billed on a monthly basis may receive bills based on
estimated usage, except that every third bill shall be based on an actual meter
reading.
The due date for current billing is twenty one (21) days after the billing date. Payment
must be received in the village office by due date to avoid late penalty charges. When
the twenty first day of any month is on a Sunday or legal holiday, then such bills for
service shall be payable no later than the next succeeding business day.
If payment of the entire amount of said bill is not received by the Village on or before
the twenty first day after the billing date, then a late payment penalty of ten percent
(10%) of the unpaid balance of the bill shall be added thereto and become due and
payable.
A second notice shall be mailed within five (5) days after the due date, showing the
amount due plus the late penalty.
If payment has not been made within twenty five (25) days after the second notice a
reminder letter with a shutoff notice shall be mailed to the consumer thereafter
advising the consumer of the Village's intent to shut off their water service, the shutoff
procedures, and their right to request a hearing with respect to any disputed service
charges or late fees. Unless the hearing committee determines otherwise, the red
tag and shutoff procedure shall commence twelve (12) days after the shutoff notice.
B. Nonpayment of Charges: All delinquent service charges shall be subject to the notice
and hearing requirements as provided by federal law.
At any time after rendition of any bill for water services or late fees, a consumer
disputing their liability for such charges may request a hearing before the hearing
committee. Such request for hearing shall be in writing and delivered to the Village's
finance department. The hearing committee shall consist of the Village's finance
director and billing clerk. The hearing committee shall set a hearing within five (5)
business days of the receipt of the written request therefor. In the event the
consumer makes such a hearing request, the consumer's water service shall not be
shut off until after such hearing and the hearing committee's decision thereon.
C. Shutoff Procedures: In the event the water service charges and late fees are not
paid within twelve (12) days of the shutoff notice, the red tag and shutoff procedure
would begin. After twelve (12) days from the shutoff notice, the premises would be
posted with a "red tag" notice advising the consumer that the water service would be
shut off in forty eight (48) hours unless full payment is made. After the shutoff notice,
payment must be made at the Village's finance department and only by cash, money
order or cashier's check and shall include a fee in the amount set forth in the annual
fee ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3 of this code for drafting,
recording and serving the red tag notice, if it has been served at the time of payment.
Upon water service shutoff the building department shall post the premises with a
notice that the premises is "unfit for human occupancy".
Services shall not be reinstated until all past due bills, including penalties and fees
are paid in full. There is a shutoff fee and an additional turn on fee for reinstating
service in the amounts set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained in
section 1-16-3 of this code.
D. Collection Procedures; Lien Against Premises:
1. Filing Notice: Charges for water shall be a lien on the premises as provided by
statute. Whenever a bill for water service remains unpaid twenty one (21) days
after it has been rendered, such charges shall be deemed and are hereby declared
to be delinquent, and thereafter the Village may file suit against the delinquent
owner(s) or tenant(s) to recover the unpaid user service charges as well as any
and all court costs and attorney fees incurred by the Village in filing said civil suit.
The village clerk shall also file with the recorder of deeds of Lake or McHenry
County a statement of lien claim which shall include a fee in the amount set forth
in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3 of this code for
drafting, recording and filing of the lien plus the costs of the county recorder of
deeds. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises, stating
that such notice of lien has been recorded or will be recorded.
The failure of the village clerk to record such lien, to mail such notice, or the failure
of the owner to receive such notice, shall not affect the validity of the lien or the
right to foreclose the lien for unpaid water bills as provided in this section.
2. Foreclosure of Lien: Property subject to the lien for unpaid water charges shall be
sold for nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds shall be applied to pay for the
amount due the Village and the costs and expenses incurred in the foreclosure,
including all reasonable attorney fees.
The village attorney or village prosecutor is hereby authorized and directed to
institute such proceedings in the name of the Village, in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the water bill has
remained unpaid twenty one (21) days after it has been rendered.
3. Claim for Money Due: Notwithstanding any other rights for liens, the Village may
institute any other appropriate action for the collection of unpaid water charges.
The village attorney or village prosecutor is hereby authorized and directed to
institute such proceedings in the name of the Village, in any court having
jurisdiction over such matters when an outstanding bill or any fine assessed for
violation of any portion of this chapter has remained unpaid sixty (60) days after it
has been rendered. If the Village files a claim for money due to the Village for
outstanding bills or fines assessed under this chapter, the owner or parties

CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE RIGHTS OF WAY
4-10-1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to establish policies and procedures for
constructing facilities on rights of way within the Village's jurisdiction, which will
provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe
usage, and visual qualities of the Village rights of way and the Village as a whole.
B. Intent: In enacting this chapter, the Village intends to exercise its authority over
the rights of way in the Village and, in particular, the use of the public ways and
property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues
presented by utility facilities, including, without limitation:
1. Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways
and other public ways and places;
2. Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other
conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
3. Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the Village's
utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights of way or public
property;
4. Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from
the installation of utility facilities;
5. Protect against increased stormwater runoff due to structures and
materials that increase impermeable surfaces;
6. Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are
installed;
7. Preserve open space, particularly the tree lined parkways that
characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;
8. Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights of way;
and
9. Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties
adjacent to utility facilities locations.
C. Facilities Subject to This Chapter: This chapter applies to all facilities on, over,
above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights of way within the
jurisdiction of the Village. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date
of this chapter may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the
utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise
provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.
D. Franchises, Licenses or Similar Agreements: The Village, in its discretion and as
limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar
agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within the village rights of way. Utilities that are not required by
law to enter into such an agreement may request that the Village enter into such
an agreement. In such an agreement, the Village may provide for terms and
conditions inconsistent with this chapter.
E. Effect of Franchises, Licenses or Similar Agreements:
1. Utilities Other Than Telecommunications Providers: In the event that a
utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license
or similar agreement with the Village, such franchise, license or similar
agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement
and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
2. Telecommunications Providers: In the event of any conflict with, or
inconsistency between, the provisions of this chapter and the provisions
of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the Village and
any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise,
license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of
such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof.
F. Conflicts with Other Chapters: This chapter supersedes all chapters or parts of
chapters adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such
conflict.
G. Conflicts with State and Federal Laws: In the event that applicable federal or
state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this chapter, the utility
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter to the maximum extent
possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations.
H. Sound Engineering Judgment: The Village shall use sound engineering judgment
when administering this chapter and may vary the standards, conditions, and
requirements expressed in this chapter when the Village so determines. Nothing
herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the Village to regulate its rights of
way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

ordinances, and regulations.
4-10-6 EFFECT OF PERMIT
A. Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest Created: A permit from the
Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance
with this chapter on village rights of way, and does not create a property right or
grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have
an interest in the rights of way.
B. Duration: No permit issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than
six (6) months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
C. Preconstruction Meeting Required: No construction shall begin pursuant to a
permit issued under this chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major
contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a
preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall be held at a date,
time and place designated by the Village with such village representatives in
attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose
of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation,
presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations,
procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public
during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
D. Compliance with All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the Village does
not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and
applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.

the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit
application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village
within ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings
or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from
the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from
the requirements of this chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance
with section 4-10-21 of this chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then
the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so
that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor.

by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts
thereunder.
G. Insurance Companies: All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be
effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to
conduct business with the licensee in the state of Illinois. All insurance carriers and
surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher
by A.M. Best Company.
4-10-9 INDEMNIFICATION
By occupying or constructing facilities in the right of way, a utility shall be deemed to agree
to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officials and
officers, employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including
reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents,
contractors or subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights of
way, and in providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions
are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or by a franchise, license, or similar
agreement; provided, however, that the utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not
apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising
out of or resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this chapter by the Village,
its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.
4-10-10 SECURITY
A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in the amount
set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in
accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the
completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve
as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the
permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and
other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses
that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by
permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to
public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this chapter to
perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence
solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due
the Village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the Village in the form, at the
permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an
unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter
of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the
permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of any
amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois at
which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the
reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as good a condition as that
existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village engineer,
and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of
facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the
Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related
group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior
to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village
engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the
permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the
greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for
any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating
the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may
withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed
the Village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may
be made if the permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses
which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any
action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this chapter that the Village determines
can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the
Village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee
shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection C of this
section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount
in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request
for said withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not
reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection C of
this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized
under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund,
or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after
account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the Village for failure by
the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law.
In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all
accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent
necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village
as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the Village with respect to the security
fund are in addition to all other rights of the Village, whether reserved by this
chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of
right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the Village may
have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double
monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or
otherwise violated.

c. In the case of water main or service crossing, encasement shall be
furnished between bore pits unless continuous pipe or village approved
jointed pipe is used under the roadway. Casing may be omitted only if
pipe is installed prior to highway construction and carrier pipe is
continuous or mechanical joints are of a type approved by the Village. Bell
and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of installation method.
d. In the case of gas pipelines of sixty (60) psig or less, encasement may be
eliminated.
e. In the case of gas pipelines or petroleum products pipelines with
installations of more than sixty (60) psig, encasement may be eliminated
only if: 1) extra heavy pipe is used that precludes future maintenance or
repair and 2) cathodic protection of the pipe is provided.
f. If encasement is eliminated for a gas or petroleum products pipeline, the
facility shall be located so as to provide that construction does not disrupt
the right of way.

accordance with applicable Illinois laws and regulations, and additionally, with such
local franchise or other agreement with the Village as permitted by law.
B. Other Utilities; Tree Trimming Permit Required: Tree trimming that is done by any
other utility with facilities in the right of way and that is not performed pursuant to
applicable Illinois laws and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be
considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application for,
and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
chapter.
1. Application for Tree Trimming Permit: Applications for tree trimming permits
shall include assurance that the work will be accomplished by competent
workers with supervision who are experienced in accepted tree pruning
practices. Tree trimming permits shall designate an expiration date in the
interest of assuring that the work will be expeditiously accomplished.
2. Damage To Trees: Poor pruning practices resulting in damaged or
misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for cancellation
of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages. The Village will
require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees removed
without authorization. The formula developed by the International Society of
Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the compensation for
damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees. The Village may require
the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning would
leave them in an unacceptable condition.
C. Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance: The Village may require that
special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or trees of special
significance. The required measures may consist of higher poles, side arm
extensions, covered wire or other means.
D. Chemical Use:
1. Except as provided in the following subsection, no utility shall spray, inject
or pour any chemicals on or near any trees, shrubs or vegetation in the
Village for any purpose, including the control of growth, insects or disease.

A. Notice: Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the Village, a utility
shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect,
remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights
of way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair,
maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations
of the Village in or upon, the rights of way.
B. Removal of Unauthorized Facilities: Within thirty (30) days following written notice
from the Village, any utility that owns, controls, or maintains any unauthorized
facility or related appurtenances within the rights of way shall, at its own expense,
remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the rights of way. A
facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:
1. Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise,
unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;
2. If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license
or franchise, if required;
3. If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a
required permit in violation of this chapter; or
4. If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the
permittee's license or franchise.

of the Village, the utility shall notify the Village within ninety (90) days. Following
receipt of such notice, the Village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion
of the facility if the village engineer determines that such removal will be in the best
interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the Village does
not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of
abandonment to the Village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to
the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or
person.
4-10-19 CLEANUP AND RESTORATION
The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain and other property
within ten (10) days after any portion of the rights of way are disturbed, damaged or
destroyed due to construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the
Village. This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration of roadway
surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the village engineer.
Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding,
resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right of way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. The time period
provided in this section may be extended by the village engineer for good cause shown.
4-10-20 MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE

with normal procedures for securing a permit:
1. If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right of way,
the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for
traffic on the highway or the public on the right of way including the use of
signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the
traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the
parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations,
adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such
an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the
facility is available.
2. In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the village
engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing
him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling
public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature
of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic,
the village police shall be notified immediately.
3. In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs
as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling
public.
C. Emergency Repairs: The utility must file in writing with the Village a description of
the repairs undertaken in the right of way within forty eight (48) hours after an
emergency repair.

the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this chapter from
which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.
B. Authority for Grant Variances: The village engineer shall decide whether a variance
is authorized for each provision of this chapter identified in the variance request on
an individual basis.
C. Conditions for Granting of Variance: The village engineer may authorize a variance
only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain
features or an irregular right of way line) create a special hardship that
would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public
purposes to be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would
conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are
impracticable in relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance: As a condition for authorizing a
variance, the village engineer may require the utility requesting the variance to meet
reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained
within this chapter but which carry out the purposes of this chapter.
E. Right to Appeal: Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or
determination, including denial of a variance, made by the village engineer under the
provisions of this chapter shall have the right to appeal to the village board, or such
other board or commission as it may designate. The application for appeal shall be
submitted in writing to the village clerk within thirty (30) days after the date of such
order, requirement, decision or determination. The village board shall commence
its consideration of the appeal at the board's next regularly scheduled meeting
occurring at least seven (7) days after the filing of the appeal. The village board
shall timely decide the appeal.

of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a fine in accordance with the
general penalty provisions contained in section 1-4-1 of this code. There may be
times when the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this
chapter. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking
the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the Village's costs of
damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing
the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or
commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the
Village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs
apportioned to it.
4-10-23 ENFORCEMENT
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies
that the Village may have for enforcement of this chapter.

CHAPTER 4
ANIMAL CONTROL REGULATIONS
6-4-1 TITLE
This chapter shall be known and cited as the ANIMAL CONTROL REGULATIONS of the
Village.
6-4-2 POLICY AND PURPOSE
The village board of trustees has made the following findings:
A. Animals that are not controlled by responsible owners become a hazard to public
health and safety.
B. Rabies is epidemic in wildlife and Lake and McHenry Counties, and rabies
vaccination of dog and cat pets is an important barrier to preventing an epidemic of
the disease in pets and thereby preventing a potential disease problem in the
Village.
C. Registration provides an important means of identifying owners of biting animals
and thereby establishes responsibilities for fourteen (14) day quarantines.
D. Overcrowding of animals on a premise in the Village creates nuisance and
sanitation problems as well as safety hazards to residents.
E. Regulating the control of animals in the Village is essential for the protecting of
public health and safety.

said motor vehicle is not required to be held as evidence in regard to the violation,
the police officer may allow that individual to promptly remove the motor vehicle

C. Posting Bond: If a bond the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule
contained in section 1-16-3 of this code is posted with the Village, the impounded
motor vehicle shall be released to the owner of record, upon the payment by the
owner of record of the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company.
If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to Section 7-13-4, the bond will be
applied to said fee; provided, in the event that a violation of this Section is not
proven, the bond shall be returned to the person posting the bond. All bond money
posted pursuant to this Section shall be held by the Village until a hearing officer
issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until a reviewing court issues a
final decision.
D. Preliminary Hearing: Where the owner of a motor vehicle seized under the
provisions of this Section makes a request in writing and files with the chief of police
or his/her designee, for a preliminary hearing within 24 hours after the seizure of
the motor vehicle, the chief of police or his/her designee must conduct a preliminary
hearing within 24 hours after the request for a preliminary hearing is received by
the Village; provided that if the date for the hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday, the preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day
following the Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. For purposes of this section, the
following shall apply:
1. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard
at the preliminary hearing.
2. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the preliminary hearing, and
hearsay testimony shall be allowed, if it is the type commonly relied upon
by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.
3. If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the chief of police or his/her designee
determines that there is probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle
was used as provided in Section 7-13-2, the chief of police or his/his
designee shall order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle,
unless the owner of record posts a cash bond with the Village the amount
set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3
of this code, and pays the towing and storage costs to the applicable towing
company, as set forth in Section 7-13-2.
4. If the chief of police or his/her designee determines that there is not
probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as provided in
Section 7-13-2, the motor vehicle shall be returned to the owner of record
of the motor vehicle without any fees or other costs, but the owner of record
shall be responsible to pay any towing or storage charges to the applicable
towing company.
7-13-4 PLEA HEARING/EVIDENTIARY HEARING
A. Notice of hearing. Within 10 days after a motor vehicle is impounded
pursuant to this Chapter, the Village shall notify the owner of record of the
date, time and location of a plea hearing that shall be conducted, pursuant
to this Section. Such notice shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner of record, as shown on the records of the Illinois
Secretary of State. Notice by certified mail need not be given when the
owner of the motor vehicle has been personally served with notice, in
written form, of the time, date and location of the plea hearing. The plea
hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Village
Board. The owner of record may appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea
of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, or if the owner of record
fails to appear, the cause shall be disposed of at that time, with an order or
a default order in favor of the Village which order or default order shall
require the payment to the Village of the administrative fee in the amount
set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3
of this code and the payment of towing and storage costs to the applicable
towing company, and the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until
the owner of record pays to the Village the administrative fee pays the and
towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the owner of
record has previously posted the bond authorized by Section 7-13-3 and
paid the applicable towing and storage costs to the towing company for the
release of the vehicle, then no further fees o costs shall be due. If the owner
of record pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled and
held not later than 45 days after the motor vehicle was impounded, unless
continued by the hearing officer. All interested persons shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing. At any time
prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request
of either the Village or the owner of record, direct witnesses to appear and
give testimony at the evidentiary hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall
not apply at the evidentiary hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs.
B. Decision. If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer determines,
by a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was used in
connection with a violation set forth in Section 7-13-2, the hearing officer
shall enter an order finding the owner of the motor vehicle civilly liable to
the Village for an administrative fee the amount set forth in the annual fee
ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3 of this code, and require
the motor vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner of record
pays the administrative fee to the Village, and also pays the applicable
towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company. If the owner of
record fails to appear at the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall
enter a default order in favor of the Village, which order shall require the
payment to the Village of the administrative fee and the payment of the
towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company, and the
continued impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record pays
the Village the administrative fee and pays the towing and storage costs to
the applicable towing company. If the owner of record has previously
posted the bond authorized by Section 7-13-3 and paid the applicable
towing and storage costs to the towing company for the release of the
vehicle, then no further fees o costs shall be due. The administrative fee
shall be a debt due to the Village and the Village may seek to obtain a
judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment as provided by law.
If after a hearing the hearing officer finds no such violation occurred, the
hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the motor vehicle to the
owner of record without any fee or other costs, of, if a cash bond has
previously been posted, the cash bond shall be returned. However, the
Village shall not be responsible for the payment of towing or storage fees.
At the evidentiary hearing, the citation setting forth the violation shall be
prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in the
citation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to prove
that the violation was not committed.
7-13-5 DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED MOTOR VEHICLE
If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after
an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing
to appear at the hearing provided in Section 7-13-4, or who admits guilt at the plea
hearing, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in
the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles
pursuant to the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq. as may be
amended. In all other cases, if the administrative fee and applicable towing and

basis for the determination. For buildings the Code Enforcement Official
determines to be "vacant buildings", notice of the determination will be sent to the
last taxpayer of record listed on the most recent Lake or McHenry County tax roll.
The notice of determination shall be sent first class United States mail. Failure of
delivery shall not excuse a person from complying with this section 8-1-12. The
Code Enforcement Official may personally serve or cause personal service of the
notice of determination. Any person making such service shall execute an affidavit
attesting to the facts of service. The Code Enforcement Official shall maintain a
record of such mailing for each notice of determination sent.
The notice shall specify a date and time on which the owner shall allow for a code
compliance inspection of the interior of the vacant building to determine the
extent of compliance with village property, building codes, health, fire, water and
sewer codes. The owner shall pay an inspection fee in the amount set forth in the
annual fee ordinance schedule contained in section 1-16-3 of this code to the
village within thirty (30) days of the inspection. An unpaid fee shall be a lien upon
the premises.
The notice shall contain a statement of the obligations of the owner of a building
determined to be a vacant building, a copy of the registration form the owner is
required to file pursuant to section 8-1-12F of this code, and a notice of the
owner's right to appeal the Code Enforcement Official's determination.
E. Appeal of Determination: An owner of a building determined by the Code
Enforcement Official to be a vacant building as provided for in this section 8-1-12
may appeal that determination to the village board. Such appeal shall be in writing
and shall be filed with the village board within fifteen (15) days of the date of
mailing of the notice of determination. The filing of an appeal stays the owner's
obligation to register his building as required by Section 8-1-12F of this code.
1. The burden is upon the owner to present sufficient evidence to persuade the
village board that had the evidence been known to the Code Enforcement
Official at the time the Code Enforcement Official made the determination,
the Code Enforcement Official would more likely than not have determined
that the subject building was not a "vacant building" within the meaning of
this section 8-1-12.
2. The village board shall send written notice of his decision to the owner within
ten (10) days of his or her receipt of the appeal. The village board may, but
is not required to, seek additional information from the owner. The village
board may, upon written notice thereof to the owner, take no more than ten
(10) additional days, to decide the appeal if he or she determines that such
additional time is required for consideration of the appeal.
3. An owner who wishes to challenge applicability of this section 8-1-12 to
his/her building without the Code Enforcement Official's determination having
been made, shall set forth specific facts to support nonapplicability in a writing
to the Code Enforcement Official. In the event the Code Enforcement Official
determines that the subject building is a "vacant building", the owner shall
have the right to appeal the Code Enforcement Official's determination to the
village board as provided for herein.
F. Obligation To Register: The owner of a building who knows, or from all the facts
and circumstances should know, that his or her building is or has become a
"vacant building" within the meaning of this section 8-1-12 after the effective date
of this section 8-1-12 or the owner of a building, which the Code Enforcement
Official determines at any time to be a "vacant building", or the owner of a building
whose appeal from the Code Enforcement Official's determination has been
denied by the village board shall take the actions provided for in this section within
fifteen (15) days after either the date of the Code Enforcement Official's notice of
determination or occurrence of the facts which would cause a reasonable person
to believe that the building was a "vacant building", or denial of the appeal,
whichever is applicable. Registration does not exonerate the owner from
compliance with all applicable codes and ordinances, including this section, nor
does it preclude any of the actions the village is authorized to take pursuant to this
section 8-1-12 or elsewhere in this code.
1. Registration Requirements:
a. Register the building with the Code Enforcement Official, on a
form provided by the Code Enforcement Official and pay an
annual non-prorated vacant building registration fee in the amount
set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained in section
1-16-3 of this code. The form shall include, as a minimum, the
name, street address, and telephone number of the owner; the
case name and number of any litigation pending concerning or
affecting the building, including bankruptcy cases; and the name,
street address, and telephone number of all persons with any legal
interest in the building or the premises. The form shall require the
owner to identify a natural person twenty one (21) years of age or
older who maintains a permanent address in Lake or McHenry
County, Illinois, to accept service on behalf of the owner with
respect to any notices the Code Enforcement Official sends
pursuant to this section 8-1-12 or service of process in any
proceeding commenced to enforce any provision of this section 8-
1-12, and file with the Code Enforcement Official on the
registration form, the name, address, telephone number, of said
person. A street address is required. A post office box is not an
acceptable address.
b. Renew the vacant building registration each year on the
anniversary date of the first filing for the time the building remains
vacant and pay the required annual registration fee; and
c. File an amended registration within fifteen (15) days of any
change in the information contained in the annual registration. A
new registration is required for any change in ownership
whatsoever.
2. Notice; Inspection: The form shall require the owner to indicate his or her
"acceptance of notice by posting" consenting to service of notices sent or
required to be sent, pursuant to this section 8-1-12, by posting on the
building if the owner fails to renew the registration if required, or maintain
as current with the Code Enforcement Official the information required
regarding the person designated to accept notice and service of process.
The owner shall allow for a code compliance inspection of the interior of
the vacant building and shall pay the inspection fee therefore within thirty
(30) days of the inspection. Such inspection will determine the extent of
compliance with village property, building codes, health, fire, water and
sewer codes. The village shall send the inspection report to the owner
within thirty (30) days.
3. Insurance: Obtain liability insurance and maintain such insurance for as
long as the building is vacant, and file evidence of such insurance with the
Code Enforcement Official, as follows: five hundred thousand dollars
($500,000.00) for a vacant residential building of one to three (3) units;
seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000.00) for a vacant residential
building of four (4) to eleven (11) units; one million dollars ($1,000,000.00)
for a vacant residential building of twelve (12) to forty eight (48) units; two
million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for a vacant residential building of more
than forty eight (48) units; and two million dollars ($2,000,000.00) for a
vacant manufacturing, industrial, storage, or nonresidential commercial
building.
4. Vacant Building Plan: At the time a building is registered as required
herein, the owner shall submit a vacant building plan. The Code
Enforcement Official may prescribe a form for the plan. If the owner fails to
submit the plan as provided for by this section 8-1-12, the Code
Enforcement Official may determine the plan. The plan shall contain the
following as a minimum:
a. A plan of action to repair any doors, windows, or other openings
which are boarded up or otherwise secured by any means other than
conventional methods used in the design of the building or permitted
for new construction or similar type. The proposed repair shall result
in openings being secured by conventional methods used in the
design of the building or by methods permitted for new construction of
similar type with board removed. Boarding shall be accomplished with
materials and methods described by the Code Enforcement Official
and available from the Code Enforcement Official. The owner shall
maintain the building in an enclosed and secure state until the
building is reoccupied or made available for immediate occupancy. If
the owner demonstrates that securing of the building will provide
adequate protection to the public, the Code Enforcement Official may
waive the requirement of an enclosure.
b. For buildings and premises thereof which are determined by the Code
Enforcement Official as being or containing public nuisances, as
defined in section 8-1-12C of this code, then the vacant building plan
shall contain a plan of action to remedy such public nuisance(s).
c. A time schedule identifying a date of commencement of repair and date
of completion of repair for each improperly secured opening and
nuisance identified by the Code Enforcement Official.
d. When the owner proposes to demolish the vacant building, then the
owner shall submit a plan and time schedule for such demolition.
e. A plan of action to maintain the building and premises thereof in
conformance with this section 8-1-12.
f. A plan of action, with a time schedule, identifying the date the building
will be habitable and occupied or offered for occupancy or sale. The
time schedule shall include date(s) of commencement and completion
of all actions required to achieve habitability. No plan which provides for
compliance with this section 8-1-12 or, which will not, as determined by
the Code Enforcement Official, achieve such compliance, within six (6)
months, in the case of a vacant boarded building, and two (2) years, in
the case of a vacant, unboarded, and code compliant building will be
approved.
g. All premises upon which unoccupied or vacant buildings are located
and the exteriors shall at all times be maintained in compliance with
this code.
h. Exterior lighting according to standards established by the Code
Enforcement Official and available from the Code Enforcement Official.
5. Security Guard Service: On written notice of the Code Enforcement
Official, provide bonded, licensed, and insured security guard service at
the building between the hours of three o'clock (3:00) P.M. and eight
o'clock (8:00) A.M. Such service to remain in place until the Code
Enforcement Official gives written notice that the service is no longer
required. Such service shall be required when the Code Enforcement
Official makes a written determination that the vacant building
constitutes a fire hazard, is otherwise dangerous to human life or the
public welfare, involves illegal or improper use, occupancy, or
maintenance, under such conditions that boarding and securing the
building are insufficient to prevent the actual or threatened harm.
6. Approval of Plan.
a. Review Building Plan: The Code Enforcement Official shall review
the proposed vacant building plan in accordance with the
standards below. The Code Enforcement Official shall send notice
to the owner of the vacant building of his determination.
b. Standards For Plan Approval: In considering the appropriateness
of a vacant building plan, the Code Enforcement Official shall
include the following in his or her consideration and shall make
written findings as to each:
(1) The purposes of this section 8-1-12 and intent of the village
to minimize the time a building is boarded or otherwise
vacant.
(2) The effect of the building and the proposed plan on
adjoining property.
(3) The length of time the building has been vacant.
(4) The presence of any public nuisances on the property.
(5) The likelihood that the plan or portion(s) thereof will
prevent or ameliorate the condition it is designed to
address.
7. Authority to Modify Plan, Right of Appeal. The Code Enforcement Official
shall, upon notice to the vacant building owner, have the right to modify
the vacant building plan by modifying the dates of performance, the
proposed methods of action, or by imposing additional requirements
consistent with this section 8-1-12 he or she deems necessary to protect
the public health, safety, or welfare.
8. Failure to Comply With Plan. Failure to have an approved plan within
thirty (30) days of filing the registration form or failure to comply with the
approved plan shall constitute a violation of this section 8-1-12 subjecting
the owner of the building to penalties as provided in this section 8-1-12
and to any remedies the village may avail itself of as provided for herein
and elsewhere in this code, including, but limited to, an action to compel
correction of property maintenance violations.
G. Other Enforcement:
1. The registration of a vacant building shall not preclude action by the village to demolish or
to take other action against the building pursuant to other provisions of this section 8-1-12,
this code, or other applicable legislation, including the activities authorized by subsection
H.
2. This section 8-1-12 is not intended to take the place of enforcement rights or maintenance
responsibilities of a condominium association, homeowner association, or town home
association under a private declaration of covenants. In cooperation with these
associations, the village agrees to provide notice to an association when a building within
the association’s jurisdiction has been registered as a vacant building under subsection F.
H. Property Maintenance:
1. Nuisance Abatement. The village is authorized to perform or provide for property
maintenance activities to abate a nuisance caused by a vacant building, including the
following:
a. Cutting and removal of neglected weeds, grass, trees, and bushes as authorized by
section 5-3-1 of this code and 65 ILCS 5/11-207;
b. Pest control activities, as authorized by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-8;
c. Removal of infected trees as authorized by section 4-2-1 of this code and 65 ILCS
5/11-20-12;

65 ILCS 5/11-20-13, and
e. Removal, securing, and enclosing abandoned residential properties, as authorized by
65 ILCS 5/11-31-1.01.
2. Charges for Nuisance Abatement. The Village shall have the authority to collect from the
property owner the costs incurred in performing the property maintenance activities to
abate the nuisances described in this subsection 8-1-12H. The Village shall send a bill for
the cost to the property owner, his agent, legal representative, or occupant in legal
possession or control of the premises.
3. Traditional Lien Procedure. If a bill sent pursuant to paragraph 2 is not paid in full within 30
days of the date of the bill, the village shall have the authority to file and record a lien
against the property, pursuant to Section 11-20-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS
5/11-20-15. If, for any one property, the village engaged in any nuisance abatement
activity described in paragraph 1 on more than one occasion during the course of one
year, then the village may combine any or all of the costs of those activities into a single
notice of lien. The lien must be filed in accordance with the lien procedure established by
the specific Code provision of which the property is alleged to be in violation or, if no such
procedure exists, then the following procedure shall apply
a. Notice of Lien. The village or the person performing the service by authority of the
village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of lien in the office of the recorder
of deeds in the Counties in which the real estate is located. The notice of lien shall be
filed within one year after the cost and expense is incurred. If, for any one property,
the village engaged in any nuisance abatement activity described in paragraph 2 on
more than one occasion during the course of one year, then the village may combine
any or all of the costs of those activities into a single notice of lien.
The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
(1) A description of the real estate that sufficiently describes the parcel;
(2) The amount of the cost and expense incurred or payable for the activities; and
(3) The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by the village or
someone working on behalf of the village.
After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified mail to the property
owner, his agent or legal representative or occupant in legal possession or
control of the premises and, if different, to the person who received the tax bill for
the preceding year.
b. Release of Lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien has been filed as
provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or person in whose name the
lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded of record in the same manner as
recording the notice of lien.
c. Foreclosure of Lien. Subsequent to the filing of the above-described lien, the village
may cause to be filed a complaint for foreclosure of such lien, or upon becoming a
defendant in a pending lawsuit affecting the premises or real estate, by answer to the
complaint or in the nature of an intervening petition or cross-complaint the village may
proceed in its corporate name to foreclose such lien. An action to foreclose a lien
under this section must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice of
lien. The property subject to a lien arising under this article shall be sold for
nonpayment of the same, and the proceeds of such sale shall be applied to pay the
monies owing the village.
4. Priority Lien Procedure. The priority lien procedure described in this paragraph 4 shall
apply only to costs incurred for activities performed on abandoned residential properties,
as defined in subsection 8-1-12C and is an alternative to the traditional lien authorized by
paragraph 3. If a bill sent pursuant to paragraph 2 is not paid in full within 60 days of the
date of the bill, the village shall have the authority to file and record a priority lien against
the property, pursuant to section 11-20-15.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-
20-15.1, in the following manner:
a. Notice of Lien. The village or the person performing the service by authority of the
village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice of a priority lien in the office of
the recorder of deeds in the Counties in which the real estate is located. The notice
of lien shall be filed within one year after the cost and expense is incurred. If, for any
one property, the village engaged in any nuisance abatement activity described in
paragraph 2 on more than one occasion during the course of one year, then the
village may combine any or all of the costs of those activities into a single notice of
lien.
The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth:
(1) A description of the abandoned residential property that sufficiently
describes the parcel;
(2) The amount of the cost incurred or payable for the activities; and
(3) The date or dates when such cost was incurred by the village or someone
working on behalf of the village; and
(4) A statement that the lien has been filed pursuant to one or more of the
property maintenance activities described in paragraph 2 and authorized
by 65 ILCS 5/11-20-7D, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-8D, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-12D, 65
ILCS 5/11-2013E, 65 ILCS 5/11-31-1.01, as applicable.
After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified mail to the property
owner, his agent or legal representative or occupant in legal possession or
control of the premises and, if different, to the person who received the tax bill for
the preceding year
The village may not file a lien if the lender has provided notice to the village that
the lender has performed, or will perform, remedial actions; provided, however,
that the remedial actions must be performed or initiated in good faith within 30
days of the lender’s notice to the village.
b. Recordkeeping. To enforce a lien pursuant to this paragraph 4, the village
must maintain contemporaneous records that include, at a minimum:
(1) a dated statement of a finding by the village that the property has
become abandoned residential property;
(2) the date when the property was first observed to be unoccupied by
any lawful occupant;
(3) a description of the actions taken by the village to contact the legal
owner of the property, or if known, any agent of the owner;
(4) a statement that no contacts were made with the legal owner or, if
known, any agent of the owner;
(5) a dated certification by a village official of the necessity and
specific nature of the work performed;
(6) a copy of the agreement with the person or company performing
the work and the rates and estimated cost of the work, if
applicable;
(7) detailed invoices and payment vouchers for the work;
(8) a statement whether the work was competitively bid, and if so, a
copy of all proposals submitted by the bidders.
c. Release of Lien. Upon payment of the cost after the notice of lien has been
filed as provided herein, the lien shall be released by the village or person in
whose name the lien has been filed, and the release shall be recorded of
record in the same manner as recording the notice of lien.
d. Enforcement of Lien. A lien under this paragraph 4 is enforceable
by the village, or entity or person who performs work on behalf of the village,
at the hearing for confirmation of the foreclosure sale of the abandoned
residential property and is limited to a claim of interest in the proceeds of the
sale. The priority lien is superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except
tax liens.
I. Certification: A certificate of code compliance for vacant buildings issued by the
Village and payment in full of all fees imposed pursuant to this section 8-1-12 are required
prior to any occupancy of a vacant building.
J. Boarding of Buildings: It is the policy of the Village of Island Lake that boarding is a
temporary solution to prevent unauthorized entry into a vacant building and that boarded
buildings are a public nuisance. A vacant building may not remain boarded longer than six
(6) months unless an extension of that time is part of a plan approved by the Code
Enforcement Official. A vacant building which is unboarded and code compliant and for
which boarding is determined by the Code Enforcement Official on the basis of police
reports, citizen complaints, and other information of other type considered reliable by
reasonable persons, to not require boarding to prevent unauthorized entry may not
remain vacant for more than two (2) years without an approved plan for occupancy, sale,
demolition, or other disposition of the building.
K. Enforcement and Penalties:
1. Any person found to have violated any provision of this section 8-1-12 shall be
subject to in the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance schedule contained
in section 1-16-3 of this code, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies
available to the village. Such other remedies include, but are not limited to,
injunctive relief, application to a court of competent jurisdiction for a receiver,
demolition, or condemnation, contracting for the repair or purchase of the
premises, or foreclosure of any lien the village may have thereon.
2. A separate and distinct offense shall be committed each day on which such
person or persons shall violate the provisions of this section 8-1-12.
3. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit the village from immediately condemning
as provided for in this code a building or taking other immediate action upon a
determination that the building is a public nuisance or poses an imminent danger
to the occupants of the building, or the public, health, safety and welfare.

EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
8-4-1 PURPOSE
A. Excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are undergoing
development for certain nonagricultural uses, including but not limited to,
the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial
plants, the building of roads and highways, and the creation of
recreational facilities.
B. The washing, blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon
roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing
vision and reducing traction of road vehicles.
C. Said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out
fills and embankments.
D. The sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and
to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs.
E. Said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial
purposes, destroying fish and other aquatic life, and sediment is costly
and difficult to remove.
F. The mayor and board of trustees of the village therefor declare that the
purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to safeguard
persons, to protect property and prevent the despoliation of the
environment, and to promote the public welfare, by regulating and
controlling the design, construction, quality of materials and use and
maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or
breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land
situated in the village.

accordance (conformance) with the provisions of this chapter and
issue a permit.
2. Approve the site development application subject to such reasonable
conditions as he may deem necessary to secure substantially the
objectives of this chapter, and issue a permit subject to those
conditions.
3. Disapprove the site development application.
B. If the village engineer fails to make a determination within forty five (45)
days after receipt of the application, such failure shall constitute an
approval of the application, unless such forty five (45) days is extended with
the consent of the applicant.
C. Prohibition of Earth Removal: No site development permit shall be issued
for an intended building site unless:
1. Such permit is accompanied by or combined with a valid building
permit issued by the village.
2. The proposed earth moving is coordinated with any over-all plan
previously approved by the village for the area in which the site is
situated.
8-4-5-4 FEES
Filing fees and deposits for services shall be as set forth in separate Municipal
resolutions or ordinances.
8-4-5-5 PERMIT EXPIRATION
Every site development permit shall expire by limitation and become null and
void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within one
hundred eighty (180) days, or is not completed within one year from date of
issue, except that the village engineer may, if the permit holder presents
satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started
or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time
if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit.
8-4-5-6 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF PERMIT
A. Authority: In the event any person holding a site development permit pursuant
to this chapter violates the terms of the permit, or conducts or carries on said
site development in such a manner as to materially or adversely affect the
health
welfare or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the
property of the said permittee, or conducts or carries on said site
development so that it is materially detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the village
engineer shall recommend revocation of or suspension of the site
development permit.
B. Procedure for Revoking, Suspending or Reinstating a Site Development Per
mit: No site development permit shall be revoked or suspended, nor shall a
previously revoked or suspended permit be reinstated, until a hearing is held
by the Island Lake Plan Commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be
served upon the permittee, either personally or by registered mail, and shall
state:
1. The grounds for complaint or reasons for the revocation, suspension or
reinstatement in clear and concise language.
2. The time when, and the place where, such hearing is to be held. Such
notice shall be served by registered mail or personal service on the
permittee at least five (5) days prior to the date set for the hearing. At
any such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be
heard, and he may call witnesses and present evidence on his behalf.
Upon conclusion of such hearing the plan commission shall transmit to
the mayor and board of trustees for final action its findings and
recommendations.
3. The hearing provided for in paragraph 2 of this subsection shall be held
at the regularly scheduled meeting of the plan commission occurring not
less than fifteen (15) days after receipt by the plan commission of the
village engineer's recommendation for revocation or suspension, or the
permittee's request for reinstatement, as the case may be.
8-4-6 BOND
The applicant may be required to file with the village clerk a performance bond or
other improvement security, approved by the village board of trustees and in form
satisfactory to the village attorney, in the amount deemed sufficient by the village
engineer to cover all the costs of improvements, landscaping, maintenance of
landscaping, engineering, inspection fees and incidental expenses for such
periods as specified by the village.
8-4-7 INSPECTIONS
The village engineer shall make inspections as herein required and shall either
approve that portion of the work completed or shall notify the permittee wherein
the same fails to comply with the site development plan. Where it is found by
inspection that conditions are not substantially as stated or shown in the said plan,
the village engineer may stop further work until approval is obtained for a revised
grading plan conforming to the existing conditions. Plans for grading work, bearing
the stamp of approval of the village engineer, shall be maintained at the site
during progress of the grading. Until the final inspection is made, a sign issued by
the village indicating permission to grade has been granted by the village shall be
prominently displayed on the front property line of the property involved so as to
be visible from the street on which the property fronts. In order to obtain
inspections in accordance with the following schedule, the permittee shall notify
the village engineer at least two (2) full working days before the said inspection is
to be made:
A. Rough Grading: When all rough grading has been completed.
B. Final Inspection: When all work, including installation of all drainage and
other structures and required planting, has been completed.
8-4-8 SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
A. If at any stage of the grading, the village engineer determines by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public
way, watercourse or drainage structure, the village engineer may require,
as a condition to allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable
safety precautions be taken as he considers advisable to avoid the
likelihood of such peril. "Special precaution" may include, but shall not be
limited to, specifying a more level exposed slope, construction of
additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing,
installation of plant materials for erosion control and reports of a
registered professional engineer whose recommendations may be made
requirements for further work.
B. Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install
temporary planting to control erosion, install temporary structures or take
such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or
the public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions
prevail, the village engineer may specify the time of starting grading and
time of completion or may require that the operation be conducted in
specified stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or
devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.
8-4-9 RESPONSIBILITY
Failure of the village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend denial of the site development permit, or of the
village engineer or Plan Commission to deny said permit, shall not relieve the
permittee from responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom, and
shall not result in the village, its officers or agents being responsible for any
condition or damage resulting therefrom.
8-4-10 EXCEPTIONS
The mayor and board of trustees, after recommendation by the Island Lake Plan
Commission, may authorize exceptions to any of the requirements and
regulations set forth in this chapter upon the conditions set forth herein:

8-8-3 STORM SEWERS
A. Storm sewers shall be designed to carry a rate of flow not less than the runoff
rate computed by the McMath formula modification of the rational method as
follows:
Q = CI (S/A)1/4 where Q = Runoff rate in cubic feet per second
A = Tributary drainage area in acres
S = Slope of drainage area in feet per thousand
I = Rainfall intensity for a ten (10) year storm frequency in inches per hour
C = Rainfall-runoff coefficient using the following values:
Roofs and pavements: 0.95
Lawns and unimproved land: 0.15
B. The size of storm sewers shall be determined on the basis of Kutters formula or
the Mannings formula using an "n" roughness coefficient of 0.013 for smooth pipe
and 0.021 for corrugated pipe.
8-8-4 LAND DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS
All land developments and improvements within the jurisdictional control of the village
must have adequate outlet with safe storm drainage capacity for storm water drainage as
determined by the village engineer. If the storm water drainage outlet is not adequate,
then detention facilities for storm water runoff shall be provided as determined by the
village engineer to store the excess storm water. A combination of on-site excess storm
water storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be provided for all of the
following land uses:
A. Commercial and industrial building developments of two (2.0) acres or larger in
area.
B. Multiple-family dwelling developments of five (5.0) acres and larger in area.
C. Single-family dwelling developments of ten (10.0) acres and larger in area.
8-8-5 STORM WATER RUNOFF RELEASE RATE
The storm water runoff release rate from all land developments and improvements
required to provide detention facilities for excess storm water shall not exceed the storm
water runoff rate from the area calculated for a rainfall storm of three (3) year frequency
with a rainfall runoff coefficient of 0.15, unless the permit applicant can show by detailed
calculations of an Illinois registered professional engineer which are approved by the
village engineer that the safe storm drainage capacity of the existing outlet serving the
tributary watershed is greater.
8-8-6 BYPASS STORM WATER FLOW
The storm water drainage system for all land developments and improvements shall be
designed with adequate bypass capacity to convey the storm water runoff flow from all
tributary watershed areas through the land development area to the existing drainage
outlet. The bypass storm water flow rate for upstream tributary watershed areas shall be
computed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a one hundred (100) year storm with a
rainfall-runoff coefficient of 0.35. An allowance will be made for upstream detention
storage when such upstream storage and runoff release rate has previously been
approved by the village and has been constructed.
8-8-7 EXCESS STORM WATER STORAGE
A. The required volume of live detention storage of excess storm water shall be
calculated on the basis of the runoff from a one hundred (100) year frequency
rainfall of any duration, as published by a recognized agency from the fully
developed watershed that is tributary to the storm water storage area less the
volume discharged from the watershed during the same duration at the allowable
storm water release rate. The live detention storage (LDS) required for all excess
storm water flows shall be calculated by the following formula:
LDS = CI100T - 0.15 I3T
where
LDS = Live detention storage in inches of depth which can be converted to acrefeet
by multiplying by the drainage area in acres and by the factor of 0.0833.
C = Rainfall-runoff coefficient calculated for the ultimate development of the total
tributary watershed area using the following values:
Roofs and pavements: 0.95
Lawns and unimproved land: 0.15
I100 = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour determined by a recognized agency for
a 100 year storm frequency for any and all durations.
I3 = Rainfall intensity in inches per hour determined by a recognized agency for a
3 year storm frequency for any and all durations.
T = Time of duration in hours of the 100 year storm varied to determine the most
critical runoff rate and therefore the maximum live detention storage.
B. Dry bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed to serve a secondary
purpose for recreation, open space or other types of uses that will not be
adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding. A method of carrying the
low flow through these areas shall be as provided in addition to a system of
drains, and both shall be provided with a positive gravity outlet to natural channel
or storm water.
1. The combination of storage of water from a one hundred (100) year storm
and the design release rate shall not result in a storage duration in excess of
seventy two (72) hours.
2. Maximum depth of planned storm water storage shall not exceed four feet
(4') unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to
greater storage depth, which shall be approved by the Village.
3. Minimum grades for turf areas shall be two percent (2%) and maximum
slopes shall be ten percent (10%) (ten [10] units horizontally to one unit
vertically). Storage area side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land
contours as practical and a ten percent (10%) slope or less shall be used
wherever possible. If slopes greater than ten percent (10%) are necessary to
meet storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be obtained
from the village and suitable erosion control provided in addition to the
protection required to insure public health, safety and welfare.
4. Outlet control structures shall be designed as simply as possible and shall
require little or no attention for proper operation. Each storm water storage
area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event
that a storm in excess of the one hundred (100) year frequency storm
occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function
without attention and shall become part of the "natural" or surface channel
system. Hydraulic calculations shall be submitted to the village engineer to
substantiate all design features. Both outlet control structures and
emergency overflow facilities shall be designed and constructed to fully
protect the public health, safety and welfare. Storm water runoff velocities
shall be kept at a minimum and turbulent conditions at an outfall control
structure will not be permitted without complete protection for the public
safety. The use of restrictive fences shall be kept to a minimum and used
only as a last resort when no other method is feasible.
C. Wet bottom storm water storage areas shall be designed in accordance with all of
the requirements for dry bottom storm water storage areas except that a low flow
conduit and system of drains with a positive gravity outlet shall be eliminated.
However, the following additional conditions shall be complied with:
1. Water surface area shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the tributary
drainage area.
2. Shoreline protection shall be provided to prevent erosion from wave action.
3. Minimum normal water depth shall be four feet (4'). If fish are to be used to
keep the pond clean, a minimum of twenty five percent (25%) of the pond
area shall be a minimum of ten feet (10') deep.
4. Facilities shall be available, if possible, to allow the pond level to be lowered
by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance.
5. Control structures for storm water release shall be designed to operate at full
capacity with only a minor increase in the water surface level hydraulic
calculations shall be submitted to the village engineer to substantiate all
design features.
6. Aeration facilities to prevent pond stagnation shall be provided. Design
calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration facilities shall
be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for the perpetual
operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be prepared to the
satisfaction of the village.
7. In the event that the water surface of the pond is to be raised for purposes of
storing water for irrigation or in anticipation of the evapotranspiration
demands of dry weather, the volume remaining for storage of excess storm
water runoff shall still be sufficient to contain the one hundred (100) year
storm runoff.
D. Paved surfaces that are to serve as storm water storage areas shall have
minimum grades of one percent (1%) and shall be restricted to storage depths of
one foot (1') maximum. Roof top storage shall be designed with permanent- type
control outlets and parapet walls to contain runoff on the roof top. Emergency
overflow areas shall be provided to insure that the weight of water stored will not
exceed the structural capacity of the roof. If a portion of an area within a storm
water storage area is to be paved for parking or recreational purposes, the paved
surface shall be placed at the highest elevation within the storage area as
possible. Maximum parking lot grades shall not exceed normal design
parameters of three percent (3%) to five percent (5%).
8-8-8 GROUND WATER RECHARGE
The ability to retain and maximize the ground water recharge capacity of the area being
developed is encouraged. Design of the storm water runoff control system shall give
consideration to providing ground water recharge to compensate for the reduction in the
percolation that occurs when the ground surface is paved and roofed over. Specific
design calculations and detail shall be provided with the final plans and specifications
presented for village approval. The use of natural gravel deposits for the lower portions
of storm runoff storage areas, the flattening of drainage slopes and the retention of
existing topography are examples of possible recharge methods.
8-8-9 CONSTRUCTION OF STORM WATER CONTROL FACILITIES
A. Where development of a property presents the threat of flooding or damage by
flash runoff to downstream residents, the facilities for storm water runoff control
shall be constructed prior to any earth moving or drainage construction on the
project site.
B. During the construction phases of land development, facilities shall be provided
to prevent the erosion and washing away of the earth1. Silting of downstream
areas shall be prevented through the strategic use of stilling basins, sodding of
runoff channels and by limiting the period of time during which the earth is
stripped of vegetation.
C. The construction of the storm water control system shall be accomplished as part
of the cost of land development. If the amount of storage capacity can be
increased to provide benefit to the village, negotiations for public participation in
the cost of development may be feasible.
8-8-10 SUBMITTAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN DATA
Plans, specifications and all calculations for storm water runoff control as required
hereunder shall be submitted to the village engineer for review and approval prior to the
village's approval of a final plat in the case of subdivisions and planned unit
developments, or issuance of a building permit in the case of commercial or industrial
construction.
8-8-11 SURFACE WATER RUNOFF
A. This section shall apply where there is construction and/or alteration of buildings
and structures or any parts of appurtenances thereto. Top dressing shall not be
included.
B. The applicant for a permit shall submit a topographic survey, review of data to
the Municipality relating to surface water runoff control, the grading plans
submitted at the time of land development where applicable and set out
proposed elevations using USGS sea level datum for any proposal. Such
information shall include pertinent elevations relating to surrounding and
contiguous properties and show clearly any possible altering of surface water or
subterranean flow patterns.
C. The placement of any fill material affecting any construction and/or alteration and
further involving any driveways, parking areas, terraces or retaining walls shall
require a permit from the building commissioner. The building commissioner shall
act upon the recommendation of the village engineer for the type of construction,
surface water detention, effect of filling or shaping the land and avoidance of
hazard to persons or damage to property which may result from the issuance of
the permit.
D. If, in the construction or alteration of a building or structure, it is found that a drain
tile will be affected, the drain tile shall be relocated or replaced so that there is no
obstruction of the tile line and so that the tile line will carry storm water for the
purpose for which it was intended.
E. If said permit involves the filling of land within the confines of these regulations, a
permit fee in the amount in the annual fee ordinance contained in section 1-1630f
of this code shall be due and payable upon application of these rules and
regulations to the subject tract.

8-11-3 GENERAL CRITERIA
In order to be in compliance with this chapter, an individual project must meet the
following general criteria:
A. Only the following materials, individually or in combination, may be used: stone
riprap (river run stone or crushed limestone), steel, PVC, or aluminum sheet
piling, cellular retaining blocks, geotechnical fabric materials, and natural
vegetation provided all other conditions of this chapter are met. Alternative
materials to those listed above may be submitted for the board of trustees to
review and approve. Such materials may be, but are not limited to, gabion
baskets or fabric formed concrete revetments.
B. The following materials listed, but not limited to, may not be used in any case:
auto bodies or parts, garbage or debris, scrap lumber, concrete refuse, metal
refuse, roofing materials, asphalt or other bituminous materials, tires or wheels,
or any material which would cause, or have potential to cause, water pollution as
defined by the EPA act or any other material found to be unsuitable, for its
intended use, by the building inspector and/or the village board of Island Lake.
C. The length of shoreline protection shall not be less than the property owner's full
shoreline frontage.
D. Any/all material utilized shall be properly sized and anchored to resist anticipated
forces, such as, but not limited to, current, wave, earth, and ice action.
E. Protective structures shall be constructed so as to be totally self-supporting
during periods of low water levels.
F. Materials shall be placed in a way which would not cause erosion, or the
accumulation of debris, on properties to or opposite the project.
G. Materials or protective structures shall not be placed higher than the existing top
of bank.
H. Alterations to the grade and subsequent elevations of the existing property may
require an additional permit(s) (per Ordinance 8.4; Erosion and Sedimentation
Control, 8.5; Special Flood Hazard Areas, and 8.8; Storm Water Drainage).
Consult the building inspector for additional information.
I. The maximum slope allowable for vegetation to be utilized as shoreline protection
shall be three (3) horizontal to one vertical.
J. Materials should be placed so that the modified cross sectional area of the
channel will conform to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of
the site. In no case shall the cross sectional area of the natural channel be
reduced by more than ten percent (10%) nor the volume of material placed
exceed one cubic yard per lineal foot of streambank or shoreline. The bank may
be graded to obtain a flatter slope and to lessen the quantity of material required.

structure(s); and
2. The volume of material placed, including the structure, would not exceed
one cubic yard per linear foot.
Approved 3/22/2012
8-11-4 DESIGN GUIDELINES
A. Technical Assistance: For technical assistance in designing shoreline or
streambank protection it is suggested that you contact the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Mississippi 39180, for a
copy of the booklet, "Streambank Protection Guidelines...For Landowners and
Local Governments" or a registered professional engineer.
B. General Guidelines For Riprap Placement: The following suggestions are listed
as general guidance for the placement of riprap, the most common form of bank
protection
1. A well distributed mix of stones weighing from ten (10) to twenty (20)
pounds per stone or larger should be used.
2. The thickness of the riprap layer should be from ten (10) to eighteen (18)
inches. Portions of the riprap layer that would normally be underwater
should be increased to twelve (12) to eighteen (18) inches.
3. Below the riprap layer there shall be a six inch (6") layer of filter medium
such as sand or washed gravel, and a layer of filter fabric.
4. Dumped riprap should be placed at a slope of two (2) horizontal to one
vertical or flatter. The slope may be increased to 1.5 horizontal to one
vertical for hand placed riprap.
5. A riprap trench or apron should be provided at the base of the protected
bank for stability.
6. Both ends of the project should be "tied" into the bank; the most common
method being to excavate a trench in the bank and fill it with riprap.
C. Privately Owned Sand Beaches: A sand beach will only be allowed in areas
behind shoreline protection. Beach must be constructed in such a way that at no
time will sand be introduced into the lake. Existing sand beach areas are not
allowed to bring in any new sand. Anyone doing so will be subject to fines in the
amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance contained in section 1-16-3 of this
code or more and information will be given to the U.S. army corps for additional
penalties as their guidelines allow.
D. Concrete: Concrete retaining/sea walls provide an excellent form of shoreline
protection provided proper design and construction methods are used. The
following minimum guidelines are intended to provide general information on
sound concrete retaining wall construction practices:
1. All concrete used shall have a twenty eight (28) day compressive strength of
three thousand (3,000) psi.
2. Minimum wall thickness should be eight inches (8").
3. All concrete retaining walls shall have a footing which will be a minimum of
forty two inches (42") below the grade of the waterward side, and be keyed
into the earth.
4. All concrete retaining walls, except gravity walls, will have at least the
minimum amount of reinforcing steel, properly located, required by the (ACI)
American Concrete Institute Code.
5. A sufficient amount of two inch (2") round weep holes shall be installed to
reduce the hydrostatic back pressure on the wall. A system of drain tiles and
washed gravel backfill shall also be utilized to relieve such pressures.
6. The air content of the concrete shall be 5.1% to reduce the likelihood of
damage due to freeze-thaw action.
7. Consult a registered engineer or competent contractor regarding the proper
design required to overcome the various loads created by, but not limited to,
varying soil conditions, water table elevations, frost-heave, and supercharge
loads due to the location of buildings and/or roadways, etc.
E. Steel/Aluminum Sheet Pile: Sheet pile can also provide long lasting cost effective
shoreline protection provided proper design and construction methods are utilized.
The following minimum guidelines are intended to provide basic background
information on sound design and construction considerations:
1. Steel shall be at least ASTM A-328 grade or better with a minimum yield
point (Fy) of 38.5 Ksi or better, a minimum allowable stress (Fa) of 25 Ksi or
better and a minimum length of six feet (6').
2. Aluminum sheeting, bracing assemblies, wales, cap, tie rods, shims and
clips, shall be made from aluminum alloy 6061-T6 designation B22 (Fu [min]
- 38 Ksi and Fy [min] - 35 Ksi).
3. Use of dissimilar metals together should be avoided.
4. Care should be taken to install the sheet pile plumb and horizontal.
5. A major percentage of retaining wall failures is due to improper installation or
lack of tie backs, therefore, tie backs must be designed for and installed
accurately to ensure proper stress transfer
6. Anchor plates or "dead-men", minimum length of six feet (6'), will be installed
in undisturbed soil if possible.
7. A cap four inch by four inch (4" x 4") minimum must be installed on the top of
the wall to ensure rigidity, alignment, and safety.
8. Install an adequate amount of two inch (2") round weep holes to relieve
hydrostatic back pressure. A system of drain tiles and washed gravel backfill
shall also be utilized to relieve such pressures.
9. Consult a registered engineer or competent contractor regarding proper
design and installation requirements.
10. Consult the manufacturer of the sheet pile used to ensure any and all special
conditions are met, such as, but not limited to, soil conditions (including
chemical), chemical makeup of water (pH, etc.), minimum number and
spacing of tie rods, or use of concrete cap.
11. Sheet piling shall extend a minimum of forty two inches (42") below grade (at
the waterward side) or shall extend an equal amount to that exposed above
grade, i.e., a five foot (5') tall wall shall extend five feet (5') below grade for a
total sheet length of ten feet (10').
F. Backfilling: The removal of materials from the lake bed for backfilling is strictly
prohibited. Penalties will follow the guidelines of section 404 of the clean water act,
paragraph S4A.
G. Special Conditions:
1. A permit issued for the work, as mentioned above, does not authorize any other
construction related activity such as, but not limited to, changes in grade or pier
construction.
2. Existing sea walls that do not comply with the above specifications may continue
to exist under "nonconforming use" until such time the structure is either modified
or deemed to be in an unsafe or unsightly condition by the building inspector.
3. There shall be no excavation of shoreline for any reason unless and until a permit
is granted by the village for such work.
4. If at any future date the department of transportation, the corps of engineers or
the village determines that the sea wall obstructs or impairs navigation, or in any
way infringes on the rights or interests of the public or any individual party, the
permittee agrees to make necessary modifications to the sea wall as determined
by the department of transportation, the corps of engineers, or the village.
5. This chapter does not convey title to any permittee or recognize title of any
permittee to any submerged or other lands, and furthermore, does not convey,
lease or provide any right or rights of occupancy or use of the public or private
property on which the project or any part thereof will be located, or otherwise
grant to any permittee any right or interest in or to the property whether the
property is owned or possessed by the state or by any private or public party or
parties.
6. This chapter does not release any permittee from liability for damage to persons
or property resulting from the work covered by the permit, and does not authorize
any injury to private property or invasion of private rights.
7. This chapter does not relieve any permittee of the responsibility to obtain other
federal, state or local authorizations required for the construction of the permitted
activity; and if the permittee is required by law to obtain authorization from any
federal authority to do the work, the authorization is not effective until the federal
approval is obtained.
8. The permittee shall, at his own expense, remove all temporary piling, cofferdams,
false work, and material incidental to the construction of the project, from the
floodway, stream or lake in which the work is done. If the permittee fails to
remove such structures or materials, the village may have removal made at the
expense of the permittee. If future need for public navigation, or public interests
of any character by state or federal government, necessitates changes in any
part of the structure or structures, such changes shall be made by and at the
expense of the permittee or his successors as required by the department of
transportation or other properly constituted agency, within sixty (60) days from
receipt of written notice of the necessity from the department or other agency,
unless a longer period of time is specifically authorized.
9. If a project authorized by this permit is located in or along a meandered stream,
the permittee and his successors shall make no claim whatsoever to any interest
in any accretions caused by the project.
10. In issuing this permit, the village does not approve the adequacy of the design or
structural strength of any structure or improvement authorized by this permit.
11. All sea walls, whether originally built in conformity with the requirements of this
chapter or existing as a legal nonconforming use, shall be maintained to prevent
shoreline erosion in safe sightly condition. Any sea wall deemed unsafe or
unsightly by the building inspector shall be repaired or rebuilt so as to conform to
the requirements of this chapter.

LANDSCAPING AND TREES
8-14-1 INTENT AND SCOPE
It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations limiting the removal and insuring the
replacement of trees from all public and private property within the village and in doing so
safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment of the community and protect property
values. These regulations are further intended to dissuade the unnecessary and arbitrary
clearing of land so as to preserve the existing natural vegetation. Village review of the
required landscape plan shall not commence until the Tree Inventory and Tree Preservation
Plan as outlined herein are submitted in an acceptable format
8-14-2 PROVISIONS:
A. Applicability: These regulations shall apply, unless otherwise noted, to all developments,
substantial redevelopments, or changes in use requiring technical review by the village,
except detached single family residential lots whether improved or unimproved and
commercial nurseries.
B. Procedure.
1. Approval: No deciduous tree having a trunk diameter of six (6) inches or greater as
measured at four and one half (4 1/2”) feet above ground level, hereinafter referred to
as Diameter Breast Height (DBH), or evergreen tree measuring twelve (12) feet of
more in height shall be removed without a Tree Removal Permit from the village
building inspector or his/her authorized designee.
a. Exception, Emergency: A tree removal permit is not required when removal is
necessary due to an emergency, immediate threat to a person, property or the
community and where such emergency renders compliance with the permit
process unreasonable. The individual who removes the tree shall first attempt
to call the village building inspector (or duly authorized agent) to obtain field
permission to remove the tree. If permission cannot be obtained due to the
unavailability of village staff, the tree may be removed, provided the person
removing the tree notifies the building inspector within forty eight (48) hours of
the removal of the tree and submits a tree removal application as set forth
herein.
2. Permit Fee: A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be charged for each tree
removal permit to cover the cost of staff review. A single permit may authorize the
removal of more than one tree, but shall only apply to a single parcel of land.
3. Conditions for permit approval: The building inspector may approve an application for
a tree removal permit. Only under one or more of the following circumstances will the
staff review fee be waived and tree replacement not be required:
a. Safety Hazard: The tree poses a safety hazard to persons, property or the
community which cannot be remedied by proper tree pruning techniques alone.
b. Diseased or weakened trees: If the tree is substantially diseased or
weakened by age, storm, fire or other injury. Trees intentionally damaged or
injured in any way are excluded. A report from a licensed Illinois arborist may be
requested by the building inspector if deemed appropriate.
c. Observation of Good Forestry Practices: If removal of one or more specified trees
is in accordance with good forestry practice as determined by an Illinois licensed
arborist and approved by the village building inspector or his/her designee(s).
d. A Final Landscape Plan and a Tree Preservation Plan have both been approved
for the property.
4. Application: The written application shall consist of a description of the tree(s)
proposed for removal and supporting justification. The description shall include a plat
of survey showing the location, size, crown spread, type, and condition of each tree to
be removed and the location of proposed improvements. Size of evergreen trees shall
be measured by height in feet.
5. Fine: in addition to providing or paying for replacement trees in accordance with
section G, violators of this section may be fined $100.00 per caliper inch for each tree
removed without, or in violation of a permit or preservation plan. If said tree has
already been removed, diameter remaining stump will be used to determine the size
in order to assess a penalty. Each tree removed shall constitute a separate offense.
C. Applicability: Ali developments, substantial redevelopments, or changes in use requiring
technical review by the village shall contain a Tree Preservation Plan, except detached
single family residential lots whether improved or unimproved. No vegetation protected by
this ordinance shall be removed prior to compliance with the procedures set forth in
section B. If no deciduous trees six inches in DBH or larger exist on the site, the developer
shall include a certification on the Landscape Plan prepared by a licensed Landscape
Architect stating that no such trees exist on the property.
D. Tree inventory: A tree inventory prepared by a licensed Landscape Architect or Licensed
Arborist shall be submitted at the time of technical review indicating the location, elevation,
size, crown spread, type, and condition of all deciduous trees located on the parcel with a
diameter of six (6") inches or greater at Diameter Breast Height (DBH) and all evergreen
trees located on site with a size of twelve (12') feet or greater. Size of evergreen trees
shall be measured by height in feet. All trees shall be tagged with a metal one (1") inch
disk numbered to correspond to the tree inventory.
The following rating system shall be used to evaluate existing vegetation:
Rating:
1 = Worst Condition: A rating of one (1) is given to a tree that has a majority of deadwood,
extensive sweep or lean, diseased or damaged by insect pests and larvae, lightening
damage, split or other physical damage.
2 = Bad Condition: A rating of two (2) is given to a tree that has some deadwood, minor
sweep or lean, distorted shape, trunk or bark damage, multi-stems, or poor physical
condition.
3 = Typical Condition: A rating of three (3) is given to a tree that is average in condition,
form, physical state, appearance and health.
4 = Above Average Condition: A rating of four (4) is given to a tree of desirable species that
has lithe or no damage, fairly straight, sound shape and form, and is in good overall
physical quality.
5 = Excellent Condition: A rating of five (5) is given to a tree that is excellent in appearance,
condition and form, appearing to have well-developed root system, balanced branching
and healthy. A tree with a rating of five (5) is a desirable species worth preserving.
E. Tree Preservation Plan: A Tree Preservation Plan prepared by a licensed Landscape
Architect or Licensed Arborist using a plat of survey shall- be submitted at the time of
technical review that indicates the location, elevation, size, crown spread, type, and
condition of each tree designated to be removed and each tree to be preserved which is
located within twenty five (25') feet of any proposed improvement or construction activity
and the methods to be used to preserve such trees. For remaining tress to be preserved,
only the location of the trees is required.
The tree preservation plan shall specify the following:
1. Location of preserved trees keyed into the Tree Survey.
2. Proposed grading with one (1') foot contours.
3. Location of the tree preservation fencing as required in this article.
4. Crown spread of preserved trees.
F. Integration of proposed improvements with existing vegetation: Subject to the
determination of the village building inspector or his/her authorized designee; every
reasonable effort shall be made to integrate proposed development with existing
vegetation. The village building inspector may require changes to the site plan and/or
grading plan if in his/her opinion an alternate but equivalent plan retaining the same
intensity of use will lessen the impact on existing desirable vegetation or other natural
features. In the event that underground utilities are proposed within five (5') feet of the
trunk of a tree, the auguring of the utility line should be considered and may be requested
by the village.
G. Tree Replacement Required: Any tree intended to be removed or unintentionally removed
or damaged during construction including evidentiary compaction or disturbance of root
zone within the drip line shall be replaced at the petitioner's expense, with nursery-grown
stock as herein prescribed.
Replacements for evergreen trees shall be deciduous nursery-grown stock at a rate of one
caliper (1") inch for each two (2') feet in height of removed or razed tree unless otherwise
approved by the village building inspector or his/her designee(s).
Except when a tree designated for removal is one of the following species such tree shall
be replaced with one replacement tree from the list of species provided herein. Buckthorn
(Rhamnus cathartica), Cottonwood (Populus deltoids) Poplar (Populus), Box Elder (Acer
negundo), Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila), Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima), Willow
(Salix), Mulberry (Morus alba), Osage Orange, (Maclura pomifera) or Russian Olive
(Elaeagnus angusifolia).
Replacement Equivalents:
Trunk size of removed Tree (in DBH) Number of 3" Caliper replacement Trees
4"-9" 1

replacement trees shall be measured in Caliper (diameter) at six (6") inches above
ground.
2. Minimum Size of Replacement trees: All replacement trees shall have a minimum
caliper of three (3") inches when planted.
a. Replacement Trees: Replacement trees shall be healthy and of a quality and
species as outlined herein, approved by the building inspector (or authorized
agent) and planted in accordance with accepted landscaping practices, or with
planting guidelines adopted by the village.
All replacement trees shall be certified by the State or Federal Department of
Agriculture to be free from hazardous insects and apparent disease.
Trees shall meet the standards of "American Standards for Nursery Stock," ANSI
Z60.1-1990, (or more recent) of the American Association of Nurseryman.
Trees shall be high-quality nursery grown stock. Substandard "B-grade" or "Park

map) zone 4 or 5. Trees from zone 6B or more, i.e. warmer climate zones are not
acceptable.
Plants shall be in a healthy, vigorous condition, free of dead or broken branches,
scars that are not completely healed, frost cracks, disfiguring knots, broken or
abraded bark, redundant leaders or branches, rubbing branches, or aberrations
of any kind. Plants shall not have multiple leaders, unless this is the natural form;
multi-stem trees are not acceptable. Plants shall have full, even, well developed
branching and a dense, fibrous, and vigorous root system. Trees grown in soil
with greater than forty (40%) percent sand content will not be allowed. Minimum
root ball top diameter for all three (3") inch caliper parkway trees shall be thirty
two (32") inches. Written evidence of compliance with source requirements may
be required at time of installation.
b. Applicant shall be solely responsible for the care and feeding of all replacement
trees for a period of two years from the planting date. If said replacement tree(s)
die(s) within two (2) years of planting, it must be replaced promptly with a tree(s)
of the same size and variety as the original replacement.

evidence for measurement at DBH, tree size will be measured at the stump
diameter and said measurement used to calculate replacement requirements.
e. Failure to replace trees. If replacement trees are not planted within six months
(weather permitting) after the removal of a tree with a permit, or as replacement in
violation of this ordinance, the Village of Island Lake may at its discretion demand
a tree replacement fee in lieu of actual tree replacement. Fee shall be in the
amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance contained in section 1-16-3 of this
code per caliper inch.
f. Tree Replacement Fee: Applicant may voluntarily opt to pay the village a tree
replacement fee in the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance contained in
section 1-16-3 of this code per caliper inch of replacement tree value, in lieu of
replacing trees. Funds will be used expressly for tree acquisition, replanting
within the village or removal of nuisance trees at the discretion of the village
board.
g. Fine: In addition to providing or paying for trees, violators of this section may be
fined in the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance contained in section 1-16-
3 of this code per caliper inch for each tree removed without, or in violation of a
permit or preservation plan. if said tree has already been removed, diameter of
remaining stump will be used to determine the size in order to assess a penalty.
H. Amended plans: If final engineering review or field conditions during construction
necessitate changes to an approved tree preservation plan, said plan shall be revised
and submitted to the village building inspector for his/her review, minor changes, and
approval. The amended landscape plan shall note the location, size, and type of all
proposed replacement trees in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.

CHAPTER 1
TITLE AND PURPOSES
9-1-1 TITLE
This title of the Village code shall be known, and may be referred to, as the ISLAND LAKE
ZONING CODE
9-1-2 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSES
This code is adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the Village by the Illinois
Municipal Code for the following purposes:
A. Overall Purpose The overall purpose of this code is to implement and foster the
goals and policies of the Village’s comprehensive plan. The intent of this code is
to preserve Island Lake’s community character through regulations designed
specifically for that purpose. This code should provide a means of maintaining the
distinctive character which provides the Village with its identity and serves as a
needed contrast to surrounding suburban development in the region.
B. Land Use Patterns. The purposes of this code related to land use patterns are to:
1. Preserve the rational pattern of land uses that has been established in the
Village and encourage the most appropriate and consistent use of
individual lots in and around the Village; and
2. Encourage compatibility between different land uses; and
3. Protect the existing residential, business, office, industrial, and other areas
of the Village from the encroachment of incompatible uses; and
4. Provide for the gradual elimination of nonconforming uses that adversely
affect the character and value of permitted development; and
5. Secure adequate natural light, clean air, privacy, a safe environment, and
convenience of access to property; and
6. Promote and protect the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the Village.
C. Development Scale. The purposes of this code related to development scale are
to:
1. Preserve the community character of the Village, which is unique to the
greater metropolitan area of which the Village is a part; and
2. Preserve the scale of development of the Village; and
3. Encourage the preservation and enhancement of natural features and
resources and aesthetic amenities.
D. Public Infrastructure. The purposes of this code related to public infrastructure are
to:
1. Facilitate the most efficient use of existing and planned public facilities and
utilities; and
2. Protect Village streets from degradation by non-residential traffic; and
3. Reduce congestion and promote safety on streets and highways by limiting
traffic generation through the control of land use intensity; and
4. Avoid or lessen the hazards of flooding and storm water accumulation and
run-off; and
5. Preserve development patterns consistent with the Village's modest
investment in public infrastructure in order to minimize long-term financial
responsibilities and related liabilities of the Village.
E. Justifiable Expectations and Taxable Value. The purposes of this code related to
justifiable expectations and taxable value are to:
1. Protect and respect the justifiable reliance of existing residents, business
owners, and taxpayers on the continuation of existing, established land use
patterns; and
2. Protect and enhance the taxable value of land and buildings in the Village;
and
3. Minimize financial responsibilities relating to capital and administrative
investments and thereby avoid undue burdens on the taxable value of land
in the Village.
F. Administration. The purposes of this code related to administration are to:
1. Define the powers and duties of administrative officers and bodies
necessary to administer this code; and
2. Establish procedures for the efficient and effective use of the provisions of
this code; and
3. Establish standards for the review of applications filed pursuant to this
code; and
4. Prescribe penalties for the violation of the provisions of this code.
9-1-3 EXEMPTION
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Title 9 to the contrary, all Village uses,
buildings, structures, and facilities shall be permitted by-right in all zoning districts in the
Village, except in the R-3 Residence District (per Ordinance 1477-14), currently existing
and hereafter created, and such Village uses, buildings, structures, and facilities shall be
exempt from the otherwise applicable regulations of this Title 9, including without limitation
height, setback, bulk, parking and loading, landscaping, and other regulations.
Approved 12/10/2009; Revised 4/10/14, 9/11/14, 8/22/2019
CHAPTER 2
ZONING DISTRICTS AND OFFICIAL ZONING MAP
9-2-1 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS
To carry out the purposes of this code, the Village is hereby divided into the following
zoning districts:
A. Residential Districts (Chapter 3)
E-1 Residence District
R-1 Residence District
R-2 Residence District
R-3 Residence District
R-3 Residence Overlay District [8/22/2019]
R-4 Residence District
R-5 Residence District
B. Business Districts (Chapter 4)
B-1 General Business District
B-2 Specific Business District
B-3 Office and Research Business District
C. Office, Research, Industrial Districts (Chapter 5)
ORI Office, Research, and Industry District
D. Industrial Districts (Chapter 6)
I-Light Manufacturing District
E. Open Space and Public (OS) District (Chapter 7)
9-2-2 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT SEQUENCE
A. General Rule. This code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of
hierarchical and cumulative zoning districts and, except as noted below, is based
on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific
purpose, to encourage a particular type of development, and to protect that
development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of development.
B. Special Rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that when
different districts are juxtaposed, their differing characters may require special
treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result. For this
limited purpose, this code recognizes the concept of “more restrictive” and “less
restrictive” districts. For this purpose, the districts established by this code shall
be considered “more restrictive” or “less restrictive” in accordance with the
following rules:
1. The residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any
non-residential district.
2. The E-1 district shall be deemed to be the most restrictive residential district
and the R-5 district shall be deemed to be the least restrictive residential
district.
C. R-3 Residence Overlay District Rule. With regard to the R-3 Residence Overlay
District, the permitted and conditional uses permitted therein shall be same as
those permitted in the R-3 District. [8/22/2019]
9-2-3 ZONING MAP
A. Map Incorporated. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established
by this code are as shown on a map entitled “Zoning Map of the Village of Island
Lake, Illinois,” hereinafter referred to as the zoning map, which is by this reference
incorporated as part of this code. All notations, references, and other information
shown on the zoning map, and all amendments thereto, shall be as much a part of
this code as if specifically set forth and literally described herein. No land shall at
any time be classified in more than one zoning district, except land may be
classified in any zoning district as an overlay district where circumstances exist to

d. The maximum height of a pole sign shall be 12 feet and a minimum
height of six feet above the grade.
e. The minimum setback for a pole sign shall be 40 feet from the
center line of the road or 20 feet from the property line, whichever
is greater.
8. Electronic Message Board Signs.
a. Only one electronic message board sign shall be allowed on each
zoning lot. Lots which are contiguous to one another and are held
or leased under a common owner or lessee and serve the same
principal use or uses shall be considered a single zoning lot.

The sign must have an automatic phased proportional dimmer
which must be used to reduce nighttime brightness levels. Further,
prior to the issuance of a permit for an electronic message board
sign, the applicant shall provide written certification from the sign
manufacturer or sign installer that the light intensity has been
factory preset not to exceed the levels specified above. Electronic
message board sign users shall reduce the level of brightness of
the sign if determined by the Village that the light levels exceed the
levels specified above.
9. Permitted Extra Signs. Certain business operations are hereby found to
be unique with respect to their sign requirements and may, therefore, be
permitted to have extra signs as specified below. These include:
a. Gasoline Stations. Gasoline stations are unique because their
primary functions are performed out-of-doors in a manner
prescribed by State statutes. In addition to the signs permitted by
other sections of this Chapter, the following signs are permitted
uniquely to gasoline stations.
i. Two signs per pump island which designate the function of
the island as self-service or full service. Such signs shall not
have more than two faces and shall not exceed three square
feet per face.
ii. One sign per type of fuel sold which designates the price of
that fuel. Such signs shall not have more than two faces and
shall not exceed six square feet per face. The sign area for
more than one type of fuel may be combined into one sign.
iii. One nonilluminated sign identifying the service performed in
each service bay may be placed over the opening to each
bay. Such signs shall have one face and shall not exceed
three square feet each.
iv. One nonilluminated nameplate identifying the owner or
operator is permitted adjacent to the doorway of the station.
Such nameplate shall have one face and shall not exceed
two square feet in area.
v. Temporary signs advertising batteries, tires, oil, or other
products directly related to motor vehicles, if the signs are
located directly adjacent to a display of the products
described. Such signs may have two faces and shall not
exceed ten square feet in area.
vi. Any signs required by the State or Federal governments.
vii. TV screens attached on a gas pump that do not exceed two
square feet in area will be permitted and will not be included
in the total sign area square footage calculations.
b. Movie and Live Entertainment Theaters. These theaters are unique
because of the rapid turnover of the names of their entertainment
products. In addition to the signs permitted by other subsections of
this Section, the following sign is permitted uniquely to theaters.
i. Each theater may have one sign of up to 50 square feet
which will accommodate changeable lettering copy.
ii. A theater's changeable copy sign may have two faces if it is
freestanding, but both faces must be parallel and located no
more than two feet apart.
iii. Otherwise, a theaters changeable copy sign shall conform
to the regulations for the sign type which it most nearly
resembles.
c. Unified Business Centers. Unified business centers are unique
because of the concentrated development and their centralized
ownership characteristics. In addition to the signs permitted by
other subsections of this Section, the following signs are permitted
uniquely to unified business centers.
i. A unified business center may have one identification sign
for the center in addition to the otherwise permitted wall
signs.
ii. Such identification sign may only include the name and
graphic logo of the center, address of the center, and also
may include a time and/or temperature sign.
iii. The permitted area of such identification signs shall be
based upon a ratio of four square feet per one acre of the
center's site, up to a maximum of 75 square feet. For each
business located within the unified business center, an
additional four square feet may be added to the identification
sign, provided it displays the name of the businesses in the
unified business center.
iv. Unified business centers may have common directory signs
to guide pedestrians to individual businesses on the site.
Such signs shall be limited to one square foot per business
listed on the sign in the ORI districts and eight square feet
per business in other districts.
v. Otherwise, unified business center identification signs shall
conform to the regulations of the sign type which they most
closely resemble.
d. Restaurants. A restaurant may have additional directional entrance
and exit signs to direct traffic through the lot and may have signs
indicating menu items available for purchase. Menu signs shall not
exceed 25 square feet.
G. Prohibited Signs. The following signs and types of signs shall be prohibited in all
districts:
1. Not Permitted. Any sign not expressly permitted by this chapter is strictly
forbidden. This determination is to be made by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer.
2. Flashing Signs. Any sign that is wholly or partially illuminated by flashing
lights or intermittent lights shall be prohibited, except for electronic
message board signs permitted by Subsection 9-9-5.F of this code.
3. Portable Signs. Any portable sign shall be prohibited. Examples of such
signs are signs that have trailer hitches, signs on wheels, signs that can be
transported to and from various locations and portable signs with internally
illuminated boards.
4. Off-Site Advertising Signs/Billboards. Any sign that directs attention to a
business, service or commodity that is offered, conducted or sold at
another location than the location of the sign shall be prohibited.
5. Painted Wall Signs. Any wall sign that is applied with paint or a similar
substance on the face of a wall, building or structure shall be prohibited
6. Signs on Trees or Utility Poles. Any sign that is attached to a tree or utility
pole whether on public or private property shall be prohibited.
7. Vehicle Signs. Any commercial vehicle used for the sole purpose of
advertising a business by parking the vehicle anywhere in the Village shall
be prohibited.
8. Signage on Village Property or Right of Way. Any sign on Village property
or public right-of-way without the Village's or respective public body's
consent shall be prohibited.
9-9-6 PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICES ANTENNAE REGULATIONS
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide specific regulations and
standards for the placement and siting of wireless telecommunications antennae
and related facilities to provide wireless telecommunications services in the
Village. The goal of this section is to provide regulations that will facilitate the
location of various types of wireless communication facilities in permitted locations
so that they are consistent with the character of the Village. Minimizing the adverse
visual impact of wireless facilities within the Village, and especially within the
residential core of the Village, is one of the primary objectives of this section. This
section is intended to allow wireless telecommunication facilities that are sufficient
to allow adequate service to citizens, the traveling public, and others within the
Village, while maintaining the character of the Village as described in the Village
comprehensive plan.
B. General Standards and Regulations. The general standards set forth in this
section shall apply to the location of all personal wireless services antennae in the
Village, whether allowed as a permitted use or as a special use in the individual
zoning district regulations of this code.
1. Height. Unless otherwise authorized and approved as a special use,
personal wireless services antennae, support structures, or personal
wireless services facilities may extend to the following heights:
a. Towers and Monopoles. Personal wireless services antenna
support structures of a tower or monopole design may extend to a
height of not more than 125 feet.
b. Omnidirectional or Whip Antennae. Omnidirectional or whip
antennae may extend not more than 12 feet above the highest point
of the support structure on which it is mounted.
c. Directional or Panel Antennae. Directional or panel antennae may
not extend above the highest point of the support structure on which
it is mounted.
d. Personal Wireless Services Facilities. Personal wireless services
facilities located in a separate structure shall be limited by the
applicable height limitations for accessory structures in the zoning
code. Personal wireless services facilities located in, or mounted
on, an antenna support structure shall not exceed the height of such
support structure.
2. Location. Personal wireless services antennae shall be mounted on
existing antenna support structures or other lawfully existing buildings,
unless otherwise provided in this ordinance. No more than one antenna
support structure shall be permitted on any one zoning lot.
3. Co-Location. Unless otherwise authorized by the Village for good cause
shown, every newly constructed personal wireless services antenna
support structure shall be designed, constructed and installed to be of a
sufficient size and capacity to allow the commercially feasible location of
antennae for additional personal wireless service providers on such
structure in the future.
4. Design of Antennae Support Structure. Every newly constructed personal
wireless services antennae support structure, other than an existing
structure that is designed primarily for a purpose other than supporting a
personal wireless services antenna, shall:
a. Be constructed at the minimum height required to adequately serve
the antennae placed thereon;
b. Be of monopole rather than tower design, unless otherwise
authorized by the Village for good cause shown;
c. Not be illuminated or have any signs installed thereon (other than
private warning signs) unless otherwise required by federal law or
regulations or authorized by the Village Board;
d. Be separated from any building on an adjoining lot by a distance
that is not less than 110 percent of the height of the antenna support
structure and be designed to withstand a wind force of 120 miles
per hour without the use of supporting guy wires. For the purposes
of this requirement, this distance shall be measured horizontally
from the center of the base of the antenna support structure to the
point where the ground meets a vertical wall of such building; and
e. Be adequately screened from view by the natural tree landscaping
or otherwise designed in such a manner that the antenna support
structure itself is minimally intrusive to the visual landscape.
5. Color. Every personal wireless services antenna and antenna support
structure shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that blend
with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding such
antenna and antenna support structures; provided, however, that
directional or panel antennae and omnidirectional or whip antennae
mounted on the exterior of a building serving as an antenna support
structure shall be of colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with,
the exterior of the building.
6. Landscaping and Buffering. In order to minimize the visibility of personal
wireless services antennae, support structures, and personal wireless
services facilities, a natural screen or fence shall be erected if not already
provided, so as to provide the maximum achievable screening as
determined by the Village. Appropriate landscaping shall be located and
maintained between any personal wireless services antenna, support
structure, and personal wireless services facilities (other than a roofmounted
personal wireless services antenna) and each lot line of the
property on which it is located so as to provide the maximum reasonably
achievable screening, as determined by the Village, of such personal
wireless services antennae, support structure, and personal wireless
services facilities from view from adjoining properties and public or private
streets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such screening is required to
extend more than ten (10) feet in height. Alternatively, for a roof-mounted
personal wireless services antenna and antenna support structure, the
maximum reasonably achievable screening shall be provided between
such personal wireless services antenna and antenna support structure
and the view from adjoining properties and public or private streets.
7. Protection Against Climbing. Every personal wireless services antenna
and antenna support structure shall be protected against unauthorized
climbing or other access by the public with fencing or by other means
approved by the Zoning Enforcement Officer.
8. Equipment Enclosures. All personal wireless services facilities shall,
whenever possible, be located within a lawfully pre-existing structure or
completely below grade. Where the Zoning Enforcement Officer
determines that the location of personal wireless facilities within an existing
structure or below grade cannot be achieved in a reasonably cost-effective
manner, a new structure may be constructed to house such equipment,
such structure shall be harmonious with, and blend with, the natural
features, buildings, and structures surrounding such structure.
9. Licenses and Permits. The operator of every personal wireless services
antenna shall submit to the Village copies of all licenses and permits
required by other agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the
design, construction, location, and operation of such antenna and shall
maintain such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or
extension thereof when granted. In addition, no personal wireless services
antenna may be installed, nor may any antenna support structure or
personal wireless services facility be constructed or altered, without a
building permit issued therefor by the Village.
10. Abandonment and Removal. When any antenna, antenna support
structure, or personal wireless services facilities are not operated for the
provision of personal wireless services for a continuous period of 12
months or more, such antenna, antenna support structure, or personal
wireless services facilities may be deemed to be abandoned by the Village.
The owner of such antenna, antenna support structure, or personal
wireless services facilities shall remove such items within 90 days following
the mailing of written notice that removal is required. Such notice shall be
sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the Village
to such owner at the last known address of such owner. If two or more
providers of personal wireless services use an antenna support structure
or personal wireless services facility to provide personal wireless services,
then the period of non-use under this provision for any support structure or
personal wireless services facilities shall be measured from the cessation
of operation by all such providers of the support structure or personal
wireless services facilities.
C. Special Standards. The Village shall consider the following factors in determining
whether to issue a special use permit, although the Village may waive or reduce
the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the Village concludes
that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby:
1. Height of the proposed tower;
2. Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district
boundaries;
3. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
4. Surrounding topography;
5. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
6. Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics
that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; and
7. Proposed ingress and egress; and
8. Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures. No new tower
shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Village that no existing tower or structure can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the
applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following:
a. No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
b. Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
c. Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
d. The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures,
or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
e. The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding
new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
f. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that
render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
9-9-7 LANDSCAPE AND SCREENING REQUIREMENTS
A. Purpose. It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations controlling the
removal and encouraging the replacement of trees from public and private property
within the Village. In so doing, the Village will safeguard the ecological and
aesthetic environment of the community and protect property values. These
regulations are further intended to serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing and
disturbing of land so as to preserve, insofar as practical, the existing natural
vegetation of the area and to replace when necessary the removed vegetation with
appropriate plant material indigenous to the region.
B. General Requirements. All landscaping shall meet or exceed the minimums
required in this section, unless otherwise approved pursuant to an ordinance
granting approval of a planned unit development.
C. Landscaping Plan. A landscape plan in conformance with the following
requirements shall be required prior to the removal of any three or more trees six
inches in diameter or greater and/or prior to the removal of any tree 10 inches in
diameter or greater from any business, industrial or estate zoned piece of property
located in the Village. A landscape plan shall also be required prior to final plat
approval any time a tree in the number and size diameter set forth above is to be
removed from any property that is being subdivided and/or which falls under the
dictates of the Village's subdivision regulations. The plan shall:
1. Be developed and implemented by a qualified landscape architect.
2. Be drawn at a scale not smaller than the following: for areas of less than
two acres, at a scale of one inch equals ten feet (1" = 10'); for areas of two
to ten acres, at a scale of one inch equals thirty feet (1" = 30'); for areas of
more than ten acres, at a scale of one inch equals fifty feet (1" = 50').
Reduced copies may also be required by the Village.
3. Show specific quantity in number of trees and general location of all
existing trees six inches in diameter or larger, measured twelve inches
above the ground, all natural features, all existing and proposed public
rights of way and easements. Such plan shall also indicate those trees that
are proposed to be removed.
4. Show all proposed grading including final grades from the site plan
submissions and landscaping, including such detail as plant species and
varieties, using botanical and common names, size and quantities to be
installed.
5. The landscape plan required to be filed pursuant to this chapter shall be
filed with the Village and shall be subject to the approval of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. If the landscape plan is submitted in conjunction with
an application for a building permit, no building permit shall issue until prior
approval is obtained. No tree shall be removed unless there is strict
compliance with the terms and provisions of this chapter.
6. The Zoning Enforcement Officer is authorized to allow a landscape plan to
be submitted to the Village that has not been developed and implemented
by a qualified landscape architect when the Zoning Enforcement Officer
determines that the size and number of the trees to be removed do not
warrant the cost and expense of having a plan prepared by a qualified
landscape architect.
D. Specific Landscape Requirements.
1. Parking Lots. In order to avoid the visual monotony of extensive parking
lots, a green area must be included in the design of all parking lots
containing 100 or more spaces. The following green area landscaping
criteria will be required:
a. A green area equal to 668 square feet per every 100 parking spaces
will be included within the boundaries of the parking area itself.
b. The green area may be in the form of islands or mid-row strips.
c. No green area will be smaller than 36 square feet.
d. In addition to grass and/or other ground cover, each green area
shall have at least one tree or bush.
2. Refuse Containers; Outdoor Storage.
a. All refuse containers and all areas of permitted outdoor storage
shall be enclosed on at least three sides by an opaque fence, wall,
or landscape screening of a height and in a manner sufficient to
completely screen such containers or storage areas from view from
adjoining properties and public or private streets.
b. The requirements of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to
standard receptacles permitted for use by single family dwellings.
None of the requirements of this subsection shall apply to
receptacles placed and maintained for use by the general public to
avoid littering.
3. Antennas and Antenna Support Structures. Appropriate landscaping shall
be installed and maintained for antenna and personal wireless antenna
facilities, as approved in the special use permit ordinance.
4. Roof Top Mechanical Equipment. Except for antennas mounted on roofs
pursuant to the provisions of this code, all mechanical equipment located
on the roof of any building constructed after the effective date of this code
shall be fully screened by a parapet wall or other screening structure
constructed of materials compatible with the principal building facade to the
height of such equipment.
5. General Landscaping and Maintenance Requirements. Except for
permitted refuse containers, all areas of every lot shall be kept free of
accumulations of garbage, trash, refuse, debris, and other unsightly or
nuisance-creating materials. All landscaping shall be continually
maintained by the owner or other person responsible for maintenance of
the premises, and all planting areas shall be kept free of weeds and debris.
Undeveloped areas shall be kept free of accumulations of garbage, trash,
refuse, debris, and other unsightly or nuisance-creating materials until
developed.
E. Violation and Penalties. In addition to the penalties provided for in sections 9-11-
22 through 9-11-25 of this title, any person violating any of the provisions of this
chapter shall be required to restore the property to the condition existing prior to
the commission of the violation in compliance with this chapter at his or her own
expense.
9-9-8 EXTERIOR LIGHTING
A. Purposes. The regulations established are designed and intended to prevent

CHAPTER 10
NONCONFORMITIES
9-10-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Purposes. This chapter 10 regulates and limits the continued existence of uses,
structures, lots, and signs established prior to the effective date of this code that
do not conform to the regulations of this code applicable in the zoning districts in
which such uses, structures, lots, and signs are located.
The zoning districts established by this code are designed to guide the future use
of land within the Village by encouraging the development or maintenance of
desirable residential, business, and office areas with appropriate groupings of
compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is
frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established
and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable.
B. General Scope and Scheme of Regulation. Separate restrictions are established
for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of structures designed
for a permitted use (9-10-2), nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a
permitted use (9-10-3), nonconforming structures (9-10-4), nonconforming lots of
record (9-10-5), and nonconforming signs (9-10-6). The degree of restriction made
applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the degree of
incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically
associated with nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to section 9-11-15 of this
code, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this chapter 10
when practical difficulties exist.
In the cases of nonconforming uses of land, nonconforming uses in structures
designed for a permitted use, and nonconforming signs, the degree of
incompatibility is frequently great, the investment is comparatively small, and the
economic life is short. In these cases, elimination of the nonconformity is required
after a relatively short, but reasonable, amortization period. In the case of
nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use, the degree
of incompatibility is also frequently great, but so too is the investment and
economic life of the structure. In such cases, while eventual elimination is
required, a more extended period is allowed in which to amortize the investment.
While the regulations of this chapter 10 related to all other nonconformities allow
such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time, they restrict
further investments that would make more permanent their location in
inappropriate districts.
C. Exception for Repairs Pursuant to Public Order. Nothing in this chapter 10 shall
be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a
structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with
protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and
orders its restoration to a safe condition, provided such restoration is not otherwise
in violation of the various provisions of this chapter 10 prohibiting the repair or
restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures or signs.
D. Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No use, structure, or sign that is
accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such
principal use or structure shall have been terminated, unless it shall thereafter
conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
9-10-2 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND AND NONCONFORMING USES IN
STRUCTURES DESIGNED FOR A PERMITTED USE
A. Authority to Continue. Except as provided in subsection I of this section, any
lawfully existing nonconforming use not involving the use of a structure, or
involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land, or
located in a structure designed for a use permitted in the district in which it is
located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
regulations contained in subsections B through H of this section and in subsection
D of section 9-10-1 of this code.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or
replacement, and installation or relocation of non-bearing walls, non-bearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is
accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use
but devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided, however, that
this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections C
through I of this section.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of
land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the use thereof shall
thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
No such alteration shall create a new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity
or increase the degree of any existing parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity
of such structure. In determining whether a parking nonconformity has been
created or increased, the provisions of section 9-9-4 of this code shall control.
D. Enlargement of Structure. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use
of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, including the
interior addition of floor area, unless the use of such structure shall thereafter
conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located. No such
enlargement shall create any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or
increase the degree of any existing parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of
such structure. In determining whether a parking nonconformity has been created
or increased, the provisions of section 9-9-4 of this code shall control.
E. Extension of Use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is accessory
to a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in a structure designed for
a permitted use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in
intensity. Such prohibited activity shall include, without being limited to:
1. An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any structure or
land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the
effective date of this code or any amendment hereto that causes such use
to become nonconforming; and
2. An extension of such use, including its accessory uses, within a building or
other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not occupied by
such nonconforming use on the effective date of this code or any
amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming; and
3. An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal
hours of operation on the effective date of this code or any amendment
hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming.
F. Moving. No structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is
designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be moved in whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other
location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located after being so moved. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in
whole or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or
any other lot, unless such use shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
G. Change in Use. A nonconforming use of land not involving a structure or involving
only a structure that is accessory to the nonconforming use of land or a
nonconforming use in a structure designed for a use permitted in the district in
which it is located shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in
the zoning district in which the use or structure is located. When such a
nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be
changed back to any nonpermitted use. For purposes of this subsection G., a use
shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use
shall have been terminated and a permitted use shall have commenced and
continued for a period of five days. Any change of use in violation of this
subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the lawfully existing
nonconforming use.
H. Damage or Destruction. Any structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use
of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and that is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent
of more than 70 percent of the cost of replacement of such structure new shall not
be restored unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located and unless such restoration
is accomplished without creating any new parking, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity or increasing the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or space
nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction. In determining
whether a parking nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of
section 9-9-4 of this code shall control.
When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof to the extent of not more than 70 percent of the cost
of replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such structure may be
made and the nonconforming use may continue subject to the regulations of this
section 9-10-2; provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall be made
that would create any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase
the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity existing prior to such
damage or destruction, nor shall any repairs or restoration except in conformity
with the applicable zoning district regulations be made unless restoration is
actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage or destruction
and is diligently pursued to completion. In no event shall any damage or
destruction to such a structure by means within the control of the owner be repaired
or restored except in accordance with subsections B, C, and D of this section.
I. Termination of Certain Uses.
1. Termination by Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of land not
involving a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land or when a nonconforming use of part or all of a
structure that was designed for a use that is permitted in the zoning district
in which such structure is located is discontinued or abandoned for a period
of six consecutive months, regardless of any intent to resume or not to
abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or
resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or structure shall
comply with the use regulations of the zoning district in which such land or
structure is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the
nonconforming user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of
discontinuance for purposes of this paragraph.
2. Termination by Amortization. Any nonconforming use of land not involving
a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to the
nonconforming use of land or any nonconforming use in a structure
designed for a use permitted in that district that has not been terminated
pursuant to any other provision of this code shall be terminated no later
than five years after the effective date of this code, or any amendment
hereto creating such nonconforming use, as the case may be.
9-10-3 NONCONFORMING USES IN STRUCTURES NOT DESIGNED FOR A
PERMITTED USE
A. Authority to Continue. Except as provided in subsection I of this section, any
lawfully existing nonconforming use located in a structure not designed or
intended, in whole or in part, for a use permitted in the district in which it is located
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the regulations
contained in subsections B through H of this section and in subsections D and E
of section 9-10-1 of this code.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or
replacement, and installation or relocation of non-bearing walls, non-bearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, may be performed on any structure devoted
in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not designed or intended, in whole
or in part, for a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located;
provided, however, that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any
violation of subsections C through I of this section.
C. Structural Alteration. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use and not designed or intended, in whole or in part, for a use permitted in the
district in which such structure is located shall be structurally altered unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new
parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing
parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining
whether a parking nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of
section 9-9-4 of this code shall control.
D. Enlargement of Structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended, in whole or in part, for a use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located shall be enlarged or
added to in any manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the
entire structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all the regulations
of the district in which it is located. No such alteration shall create a new parking,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking,
bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure. In determining whether a
parking nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of section 9-
9-4 of this code shall control.
E. Extension of Use.
1. Prohibited Extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed
or intended, in whole or in part, for a use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or
increased in intensity by:
a. An extension of such use to any structure or land area other than
that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of
this code or any amendment to it that causes such use to become
nonconforming; or
b. An extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the
normal hours of operation on the effective date of this code or any
amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming.
2. Permitted Extensions. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or
intended, in whole or in part, for a use permitted in the district in which such
structure is located may be extended throughout any part of such structure
designed for such nonconforming use and not for any use permitted in the
district and lawfully existing on the effective date of this code or any
amendment to it that causes such use to become nonconforming; provided,
however, that such extension shall not be allowed unless off-street parking
spaces required for such extension can be, and are, provided in
accordance with the requirements and restrictions of section 9-9-4 of this
code. No such extension shall be deemed to affect the duty to terminate
such use pursuant to subsection I. of this section.
F. Moving. No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and not
designed or intended, in whole or in part, for a use permitted in the district in which
such structure is located shall be moved, in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
G. Change in Use. A nonconforming use in a structure not designed or intended in
whole or in part for a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located
shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the zoning district in
which the structure is located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to
a permitted use of the subject zoning district, it shall not thereafter be changed to
any use other than a use permitted in the subject district. For purposes of this
subsection G, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing
nonconforming use shall have been terminated and a permitted use of the subject
district shall have commenced and continued for a period of five days. Any change
of use in violation of this subsection shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
lawfully existing nonconforming use.
H. Damage or Destruction. Any structure devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use and not designed or intended, in whole or in part, for a use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located that is damaged or
destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than 70 percent of the cost of
replacement of such structure new shall not be restored unless the entire structure
and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district
in which it is located and unless such restoration is accomplished without creating
any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increasing the degree of
any existing parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure existing
prior to such damage or destruction. In determining whether a parking
nonconformity has been created or increased, the provisions of section 9-9-4 of
this code shall control.
When any such structure is damaged or destroyed by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof to the extent of not more than 70 percent of the cost
of replacement of the structure new, repair or restoration of such structure may be
made and the nonconforming use may continue subject to the regulations of this
section 9-10-3; provided, however, that no repairs or restorations shall be made
that would create any new parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity or increase
the degree of any parking, bulk, yard, or space nonconformity of such structure
existing prior to such damage or destruction nor shall any repairs or restoration
except in conformity with the applicable zoning district regulations be made unless
restoration is actually begun within one year after the date of such partial damage
or destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
In no event shall any damage or destruction to such a structure by means within
the control of the owner be repaired or restored except in accordance with
subsections B, C, and D of this section.
I. Termination by Abandonment. When a nonconforming use of a part or all of a
structure that was not designed or intended in whole or in part for a use permitted
in the zoning district in which such structure is located is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of twelve consecutive months, regardless of any intent to
resume or not to abandon such use, such use shall not thereafter be re-established
or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such structure shall comply with
the use regulations of the district in which such structure is located.
Any period of such discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material
shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the nonconforming
user, shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for
purposes of this paragraph.
9-10-4 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES OTHER THAN SIGNS
A. Authority to Continue. Any nonconforming structure, other than a sign, that is
devoted to a use that is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may
be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the restrictions in
subsections B through D of this section and subsection D of section 9-10-1 of this
code.
B. Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, and Enlargement. Any nonconforming
structure, other than a sign, may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged;
provided, however, that no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or enlargement
shall either create any new nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing
nonconformity of all or any part of such structure.
C. Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part, for any
distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the
entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being so moved.
D. Damage or Destruction.
1. Not within the Control of the Owner. Any nonconforming structure, other
than a sign, that is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within the
control of the owner thereof, to any extent, may be repaired, restored, or
replaced; provided, however, that no repair, restoration, or replacement
shall be made that would create any new nonconformity not existing prior
to such damage or destruction nor shall any repair, restoration, or
replacement except in conformity with the applicable district regulations be
made unless the repair, restoration, or replacement is actually begun within
one year after the date of such damage or destruction and is diligently
pursued to completion.
2. Within the Control of the Owner. In no event shall any damage or
destruction to a nonconforming structure by means within the control of the
owner be repaired, restored, or replaced except in accordance with
subsection B of this section; provided, however, that a nonconforming
structure as defined in paragraph 2 of the definition of nonconforming
structure that is damaged or destroyed by means within the control of the
owner may be repaired, restored, or replaced in the following
circumstances:
a. if damaged or destroyed to the extent of 70 percent or less of the
gross floor area of such structure, such repair, restoration, or
replacement shall not create any new nonconformity not existing
prior to such damage or destruction; or
b. if damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than 70 percent of
the gross floor area of such structure, such nonconforming structure
shall only be repaired, restored, or replaced in conformity with all
applicable district regulations except for lot area.
9-10-5 LEGAL NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD [8/22/2019]
A. Definition. A legal nonconforming lot of record is a lot that:
1. Is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been a lot of record owned
separately or individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the
creation of a lot of such size, depth, and width at such location would not
have been prohibited by any zoning or other ordinance or regulation; and
2. Has remained in separate or individual ownership from such adjoining
tracts of land continuously during the entire time since such lot became
nonconforming by reason of this code or any predecessor zoning or other
ordinance or regulation.
For purposes of this section, a lot shall not be deemed to have been owned
separately or individually unless the owner of such lot did not, directly or
indirectly, have legal title to or a beneficial interest in the adjoining tracts of
land at any relevant time.
9-10-6 NONCONFORMING SIGNS
A. Authority to Continue. Except as provided in subsection F, any lawfully existing
nonconforming sign may be continued so long as it otherwise remains lawful,
subject to the regulations contained in subsections B through E of this section and
in subsection D of section 9-10-1 of this code.
B. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental repair or
replacement of non-bearing sign elements and electrical wiring and fixtures may
be performed on any sign; provided, however, that any repair or replacement shall,
whenever possible, eliminate or reduce any nonconformity in the element being
repaired or replaced and provided further, however, that this subsection B shall not
be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections C through F of this section.
C. Alteration; Enlargement; Moving. No nonconforming sign shall be changed or
altered in any manner that would increase the degree of its nonconformity, be
enlarged or expanded, be structurally altered to prolong its useful life, or be moved
in whole or in part to any other location where it would remain nonconforming.
D. Change of Sign. A nonconforming sign that has been changed to eliminate its
nonconformity or any element of its nonconformity shall not thereafter be changed
to restore such nonconformity or nonconforming element.
E. Damage or Destruction. Any nonconforming sign, or any nonconforming element
of a sign capable of change or discontinuance separate from other elements of the
sign, damaged or destroyed by any means to the extent of 35 percent or more of
its replacement cost new shall not be restored but shall be removed or brought into
conformity with the provisions of this code.
F. Termination of Certain Signs.
1. Immediate Termination. The following nonconforming signs or sign
features shall be terminated within 30 days after the effective date of this
code by removal of the sign or by alteration of the sign to eliminate the
specified feature:
a. Any sign that advertises, identifies, or pertains to a business no
longer conducted, or a product no longer sold, on the premises
where such sign is located.
b. Any sign on a tree or utility pole, whether on public or private
property.
c. Any sign on public property, except governmental signs or signs
authorized by this code.
d. Any sign constructed or erected without a valid permit.
2. Termination by Abandonment. Any nonconforming sign the use of which
is discontinued for a period of 30 consecutive days, regardless of any intent
to resume or not to abandon such use, shall be deemed to be abandoned
and shall not thereafter be re-established or resumed. Every such sign
shall be immediately removed or brought into conformity with the provisions
of this code. Any period of such discontinuance caused by government
actions, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, and without any
contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall not be considered in
calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this paragraph.
3. Termination by Change of Business. Any nonconforming sign advertising,
identifying, or pertaining to a business on the premises on which it is
located shall be terminated upon any change in the ownership or control of
such business.

B. Definition. The “official comprehensive plan” shall be defined as a compilation of
policy statements; goals; standards; maps; recommended planning, regulatory,
fiscal, and public works programs; pertinent data relative to the past, present, and
future trends of the Village with respect to its population, housing, economic,
social, and environmental development patterns and its land, water, and natural
resources and use and its transportation facilities, public facilities, and utilities; and
any other matter relative to the present and future patterns of life within the Village
or within the unincorporated areas lying within one and one-half miles of its
boundaries as they may from time to time exist, prepared and recommended by
the Plan Commission with the advice and assistance of the Zoning Enforcement
Officer and adopted by the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together
with such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term
“official comprehensive plan” also shall refer to any internally consistent and
complete portion of such a compilation relating to any one or more of the aforesaid
subjects or to any specific portion of the aforesaid geographical area. As of the
effective date of this code, the term “official comprehensive plan” shall be
understood to mean the Island Lake comprehensive plan.
C. Purpose. The official comprehensive plan shall be considered an official statement
of the policy of the Village with respect to the existing and developing character of
the various areas of the Village and its vicinity; the proper objectives, standards,
and direction for future maintenance, growth, development, and redevelopment of
the Village; the means to be employed to protect existing character or development
and to encourage future development that will be in the best interests of the Village;
and the actions and programs to be undertaken by the Village with respect to its
future maintenance and development.
D. Effect. After the adoption of the official comprehensive plan or a part thereof, no
ordinance, regulation, or official map relating to the physical maintenance,
development, or redevelopment of the Village or any land within it shall be enacted,
established, amended, or varied and no right-of-way, street, utility, or public
structure or land shall be authorized, established, developed, redeveloped, or
modified in location or extent except in accordance with the policies, goals,
objectives, principles, and standards of the official comprehensive plan or relevant
part thereof unless the Board of Trustees shall first make a specific finding that the
facts and circumstances affecting the particular matter justify a departure from the
official comprehensive plan.
E. Procedures.
1. Plan Development. The Plan Commission, with the assistance of the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, shall exercise the powers and duties
delegated to it by section 9-11-3 of this chapter 11 in the continuing
development and revision of the official comprehensive plan. The process
of plan development is necessarily an informal one not readily adaptable
to rigid procedures, but the Plan Commission and the Zoning Enforcement
Officer, in developing a plan, shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the
views, comments, and criticisms of interested persons. In addition, the
Plan Commission, prior to making any recommendation for the adoption or
amendment of a plan or part thereof to the Board of Trustees, shall set,
notice, and conduct a public hearing thereon in accordance with the
provisions of section 9-11-10 of this chapter 11.
The Board of Trustees may, at any time, refer a plan to the Plan
Commission for consideration and recommendation. In the case of such
referral, the Plan Commission shall return its recommendation to the Board
of Trustees not later than 90 days following the receipt of the referral. In
the event such recommendation is not so delivered, the Board of Trustees
may proceed to consider the plan without such recommendation.
When satisfied that a plan or a part thereof is adequate for adoption as or
an amendment of the official comprehensive plan of the Village or a part
thereof, the Plan Commission shall transmit such plan or part thereof to the
Board of Trustees together with its recommendations for adoption of such
plan as well as any reports or statements deemed necessary to a full
consideration of such plan or part thereof. Such reports or statements may
include majority and minority positions. Such transmittal shall be made not
later than 15 days following the close of the public hearing concerning such
plan.
2. Plan Adoption. Upon receiving any recommendation of the Plan
Commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any plan or a
part thereof, the Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly enacted, may adopt
such plan in whole or in part, with or without amendments; or may refer
such plan or any part thereof back to the Plan Commission for further
consideration; or may reject such plan. The Board of Trustees shall take
such action not later than 90 days following the close of the Plan
Commission public hearing on such plan. The failure of the Board of
Trustees to act within such period shall be deemed to be a rejection of the
plan. Upon the adoption of any such plan or part thereof, it shall be
designated as the “official comprehensive plan of the Village of Island Lake”
and, if less than a total comprehensive plan, shall carry a subheading
designating its specific contents.
3. Plan Amendment. The official comprehensive plan, or any part thereof,
may be amended at any time in accordance with the provisions of this
paragraph 3. Such an amendment may be initiated by the Board of
Trustees, the Plan Commission, the Zoning Enforcement Officer, or by any
owner of lots affected by the provisions of such plan sought to be amended.
Amendments initiated by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, or
the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require no formal application and shall
be processed as provided in paragraphs E.1 and E.2 of this section.
Amendments initiated by the owner of affected s shall be initiated by an
application filed pursuant to section 9-11-16 of this code, except that the
time limits specified in paragraphs E.1 and E.2 of this section shall apply.
4. Plan Filing and Notice of Adoption. The ordinance adopting the official
comprehensive plan, or any part thereof, shall provide that the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall cause a certified copy thereof to be placed on file
in the Office of the Village clerk and shall cause a notice evidencing the
adoption of such plan, or part thereof, to be filed with the Recorder of
Deeds.
9-11-7 OFFICIAL MAP
A. Authority. The Plan Commission shall have authority to prepare and to
recommend to the Board of Trustees an official map of the Village and the
unincorporated areas surrounding the Village and from time to time to prepare and
recommend amendments thereto, all of which the Board of Trustees may adopt as
the “official map of the Village of Island Lake.”
B. Definition. The “official map” shall be defined as a compilation of maps, standards,
and specifications of and for existing and proposed rights-of-way, streets, alleys,
utility easements, public grounds, and public utility systems within the Village or
within the unincorporated area lying within one and one-half miles of its boundaries
as they may from time to time exist, prepared and recommended by the Plan
Commission with the advice and assistance of the Zoning Enforcement Officer,
and adopted by the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with
such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term “official
map” also shall refer to any internally consistent and complete portion of such a
compilation relating to any one or more of the aforesaid subjects or to any specific
portion of the aforesaid geographical area.
The official map referred to in this section is the map authorized by sections 11-
12-6 et seq. of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-6 et seq.
C. Purpose. The official map is adopted to implement the official comprehensive plan,
to assure the adequacy of the public facilities to which it relates, and to secure for
the Village the authority and benefits provided by State law in connection with such
an official map.
D. Effect. The official map shall have the effect accorded to it by sections 11-12-8 et
seq. of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8 et seq., and also shall have
the effect accorded to the official comprehensive plan by subsection 9-11-6D of

it is to be considered at a hearing or a meeting or acted upon in connection
with such application. The filing of such data shall, in the discretion of the

cause to delay a requested or scheduled hearing date.
D. Fees.
1. Filing Fee. Every application filed pursuant to this code shall be
accompanied by a non-refundable filing fee in the amount set forth in the
annual fee ordinance.
2. Additional Application Fee. In addition, where the nature of the application
requires the Village to publish or mail legal notices or to employ the services
of planners, engineers, attorneys, or other persons not regularly on the
Village payroll for the purposes of reviewing the application or plans in
connection with it or development pursuant to it, an additional application
fee equal to the actual cost to the Village of giving such notice or securing
such services shall be charged to and paid by the owner.
3. Escrow. For each application filed pursuant to this code, an application fee
escrow account shall be established as provided below:
a. Initial Deposit. Every application filed pursuant to this code shall be
accompanied by an initial deposit for purposes of paying additional
application fees pursuant to paragraph 9-11-8D.2. The amount of
such initial deposit shall be determined by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer and such initial deposit and any subsequent deposit shall be
placed in an application fee escrow account. No interest shall be
payable on any such escrow account.
b. Draws From Escrow. From the date of filing of any application, the
Village shall maintain an accurate record of the actual costs of
processing and reviewing such application. The Village shall, from
time to time, draw funds from the escrow account established or
such application to pay costs identified in paragraph D.2 and shall

d. Additional Deposits. Should the Village at any time determine that
the escrow account established in connection with any application
is, or is likely to become, insufficient to pay the actual costs of
processing an application, the Village shall inform the owner of that
fact in writing and demand an additional deposit in an amount
deemed to be sufficient to cover foreseeable additional costs.
Unless and until such additional amount is deposited by the owner,
the Village may direct that processing of the application be
suspended or terminated. Any such termination shall be deemed a
withdrawal of the application by the owner.
e. Final Settlement. As soon as reasonably feasible following final
action on an application, the Village shall cause a final accounting
to be made of the escrow deposits made in connection with such
application and the actual costs of processing such application and
shall make a final charge of such costs against such escrow
deposit. A copy of the accounting shall be provided to the owner.
If the amount in the escrow is insufficient to pay the total actual
costs, a written demand for payment of the balance due shall be
mailed to the owner. If any unused balance remains in the escrow
account after paying the total actual costs, that amount shall be
returned to the owner.
4. Liability; Lien. The owner of the lot which is the subject of the application,
and if different, the applicant, shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of all application fees. By signing the application, the owner shall
be deemed to have agreed to pay such fees and to consent to the filing
and foreclosure of a lien on the lot to insure collection of any such fees,
plus the costs of collection, which have not been paid within 30 days
following the mailing of a written demand for such payment to the owner at
the address shown on the application. Any lien filed pursuant to this section
may be foreclosed in the manner provided by statute for mortgages or
mechanics’ liens.

complete unless and until all fees pursuant to this section have been paid.
Every approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this code,
whether or not expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be conditioned
upon payment of fees as required by this section.
6. Time Periods. Where this code provides that the passage of time without
decision or action shall be deemed an approval or recommendation for
approval, all time periods shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment,
but shall otherwise continue to run.
7. Failure to Pay. The failure to fully pay any such fee when due shall be
grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or revoking
any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the land or
development to which the unpaid fee relates.
8. Waiver. The provisions of this section may be waived by the Board of
Trustees for fees applicable to any application filed by any public body, or

F. Special Data Requests. In addition to the data and information required pursuant
to subsection E of this section, every owner shall submit such other and additional
data, information, or documentation as the Zoning Enforcement Officer or any
Board or commission before which its application is pending may deem necessary
or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and disposition of the particular
application.
G. Waiver of Application Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
section, the Zoning Enforcement Officer, Zoning Board of Appeals, and/or the Plan
Commission shall have the authority to waive any requirement set forth in
subsections A, B, C, or E of this section when, in their judgment, such waiver is
appropriate in light of the nature and extent of the relief being sought or in light of
special circumstances making compliance with those provisions either
unnecessary or unduly burdensome; provided, however, that any Board or
commission before which such application may come shall continue to have the
right to request additional information pursuant to subsection F of this section and
to delay processing of such application until such information is provided and
available in accordance with the deadlines established in subsection C. of this
section.
H. Concurrent Applications. When a proposed use or development requires more
than one approval pursuant to this code, applications for all such approvals may
be filed concurrently notwithstanding the fact that approval of one application may
be a pre-condition to approval of other applications. Such applications may, in the
discretion of the official, officials, body, or bodies charged with review of such
applications be processed together; provided, however, that no application shall
be approved unless all applications that are a pre-condition to its approval have
first been approved.
I. Withdrawal of Application. An owner may withdraw an application at any time prior
to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto, provided that the
owner shall have paid all applicable fees pursuant to this code. Such withdrawal
shall be without prejudice to the owner’s right to refile such application, but any
such refiling shall be treated as an entirely new filing and shall be subject to the
procedures and fees of this code in the same manner as any other new application.
9-11-9 SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS
A. Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred. Whenever any application
filed pursuant to this code has been finally denied on its merits, a second
application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the same form or
on the same theory, shall not be brought within one year of the final decision unless
in the opinion of the officer, board, or commission before which it is brought there
is substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact significantly
affected the prior denial.
B. New Grounds to Be Stated. Any such second application shall include a detailed
statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application.
C. Summary Denial With or Without Hearing. Any such second application may be
denied by the Zoning Enforcement Officer summarily, and without hearing, on a
finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case where
such application is set for hearing, the owner shall be required to establish grounds
warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application prior to being allowed to
offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such grounds are established, the
application may be summarily dismissed for such failure.
D. Exception. Whether or not new grounds are stated, any such second application
filed more than one year after the final denial of a prior application shall be heard
on the merits as though no prior application had been filed. The owner shall,
however, be required to place in the record all evidence available concerning
changes of conditions or new facts that have developed since the denial of the first
application. In the absence of such evidence, it shall be presumed that no new
facts exist to support the new petition that did not exist at the time of the denial of
the first application.
9-11-10 PUBLIC HEARINGS AND MEETINGS
A. Setting Hearing or Meeting; Time Limitation. When the provisions of this code
require a public hearing or public meeting in connection with any application filed
pursuant to this code, the body charged with conducting the hearing or meeting
shall, upon receipt of a properly completed application, fix a reasonable time and
place for such hearing or meeting.

a. All Hearings and Meetings. Notice of every hearing or meeting set
pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be provided in
accordance with the Illinois Open Meetings Act.
b. Hearings on Amendments, Special Use Permits, Appeals, and

of this section, notice of every hearing set pursuant to subsection a
of this section in connection with any application for an amendment
to this code or the zoning map, a special use permit, including a
planned unit development, appeal, or a variation shall be given by
publication in a newspaper with a general circulation within the
Village at least once no less than 15 days nor more than 30 days in
advance of the hearing date.
c. Hearing on Official Comprehensive Plan. In addition to notice as
required by subparagraph B.3a of this section, notice of every

shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation
in the Village at least 15 days before such hearing.

in connection with an appeal by certified mail with return receipt
requested no less than 15 days nor more than 30 days in advance
of the hearing date to owners of property abutting the subject

must also be posted on the subject property no less than 15 days
nor more than 30 days in advance of the hearing date. The posted
notice must be clearly legible to public view and within 10 feet of the
property line nearest to the public right of way. The sign must be
installed by the applicant and suitably maintained until the public
hearing has closed.
C. Conduct of Hearings
1. Rights of All Persons. Any person may appear and testify at a public
hearing, either in person or by a duly authorized agent or attorney, and may
submit documentary evidence; provided, however, that the hearing body
may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
2. Rights of Parties and Proximate Owners. Subject to the discretion of the
hearing body, the owner, any board, commission, or official of the Village,
and any owner of lots within 250 feet of the subject lot may be allowed, in
addition to the rights granted by paragraph C.1 of this section, any or all of
the following rights:
a. To present witnesses on their behalf.
b. To cross-examine all witnesses testifying in opposition to their
position.
c. To examine and reproduce any documents produced at the
hearing.
d. To have subpoenas issued by the body in charge of the hearing as
may be provided by State law for persons to appear at the hearings
and for examination of documents by the person requesting the
subpoena either before or during the hearing, where such persons
or documents are shown to have a substantial evidentiary
connection with:
i. the lot to which the request applies; or
ii. facts that would support or negate the legal standards for
granting the request.
e. To a continuance, upon request, for the purpose of presenting
evidence to rebut evidence introduced by any other person.
In determining whether to grant or withhold such rights, the discretion of
the hearing body shall be governed by the goal of securing all information
and opinion relevant and material to its deliberations. Such rights shall not
be granted, however, when undue and unwarranted delay would result, or
when to do so would tend to produce no new evidence to aid the hearing
body in reaching its decision.
3. Adjournment of Hearing. The body conducting the hearing may at any
time, on its own motion or at the request of any person, adjourn the hearing
for a reasonable time and to a fixed date, time, and place, for the purpose
of giving further notice, taking further evidence, gathering further
information, deliberating further, or for such other reason as the hearing
body may find to be sufficient. The hearing body shall notify in writing all
members of the hearing body, the owner and applicant, and any other
person designated on the vote of adjournment of the date, time, and place
of the adjourned hearing.
4. Testimony to be Sworn. All testimony at any hearing held pursuant to the
provisions of this code should be given under oath.
5. Right to Submit Written Statements. Any person may at any time prior to
the commencement of a hearing hereunder, or during such hearing, or
within such time as may be allowed by the hearing body following such
hearing, submit written statements in support of or in opposition to the
application being heard.
6. Board or Commission Rules to Govern. All other matters pertaining to the
conduct of hearings shall be governed by the provisions of this code
pertaining to, and the rules promulgated by, the body conducting the
hearing.
D. Pre-Hearing and Pre-Meeting Examination and Copying of Application and Other
Documents. At any time following the giving of notice as required in subsection B
of this section, and upon reasonable request, any person may examine the
application and, subject to the exceptions set forth in the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act, all other documents on file with the Zoning Enforcement Officer
pertaining to the matter subject to such notice. In addition, any person shall be
entitled to copies of such application and documents upon reasonable request and
payment of a fee as established from time to time by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer to cover the cost of such copies.
PART IV: ZONING CERTIFICATES
9-11-11 RESERVED
9-11-12 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
A. Authority. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall have authority to issue certificates
of occupancy; provided, however, that no such certificate shall be issued except in
accordance with the provisions of this section and the provisions of the Island Lake
building code and other Village ordinances governing development and related
matters.
B. Purpose. For the purposes of this code, the certificate of occupancy provides a
procedure for the inspection of completed premises to ensure their compliance
with this code and approved plans prior to commencement of the use or occupancy
of such premises.
C. Certificate Required. Unless a certificate of occupancy shall have first been
obtained certifying compliance with the provisions of this code:
1. No structure, or addition thereto, constructed, reconstructed, remodeled,
altered, or moved after the effective date of this code shall be occupied or
used for any purpose; and
2. No land vacant as of the effective date of this code shall be used or
occupied for any purpose; and
3. No change of use shall be made in any building or part thereof now or
hereafter erected or structurally altered that is not permitted by the
provisions of this title. Nothing in this section shall prevent the continuance
of the present occupancy or lawful use of any existing building, except as
may be necessary for safety of life and property; and
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for a certificate of occupancy shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code not later
than 10 days after the completion of the construction or alteration of a
building. When a certificate of zoning compliance has been issued, the
application for that certificate shall also be treated as the application for a
certificate of occupancy and shall be processed as such at such time as
the owner notifies the Zoning Enforcement Officer in writing that the subject
structure or use is ready for a certificate of occupancy in accordance with
the certificate of zoning compliance.
In any case where the structure or use involved has been constructed or
established pursuant to any approval granted pursuant to this code, the
application shall be accompanied by “as built” plans depicting the structure
or use as built and bearing the certificate of a surveyor, engineer, architect,
land planner, or owner-designer, as may be appropriate, certifying that the
structure or use as built conforms in all respects to the approval granted.
2. Action on Application. Within 14 days following the receipt of a completed
application, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall cause the subject
structure or premises to be inspected and shall take one of the following
actions based on such inspection:
a. If all work has been completed and the structure and use thereof
are in full and complete compliance with all applicable provisions of
this code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the Village, the
owner’s plans as approved, and any conditions attached to any
approval issued pursuant to this code, the Zoning Enforcement
Officer shall issue a certificate of occupancy.
b. If, however, all work is not complete or is in any manner not in full
compliance with all applicable requirements, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall deny the application and shall inform the
owner in writing of the specific deficiencies on which such denial is
based, citing the particular provisions of the codes and ordinances
of the Village or the particular items in the owner’s plans or the
applicable special approval conditions with respect to which
compliance is lacking.
3. Contents of Certificate. In addition to the matters required to be contained
in a certificate of occupancy pursuant to any other applicable code or
ordinance of the Village, each certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to
this section shall state the specific use of the lot for which it is issued, shall
identify the specific plans, if any, pursuant to which it is issued, and shall
set forth any conditions imposed in connection with any approval granted
pursuant to this code.
4. Filing of Certificates. Every certificate of occupancy issued pursuant to this
section shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Enforcement Officer
and shall be a public record open to inspection pursuant to the provisions
of the Illinois Freedom of Information Act.
E. Temporary Certificate of Occupancy. Notwithstanding the provisions of
paragraph D.2 of this section, when construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or
alteration of a structure does not require the vacating of the structure, or when
parts of the structure are finished and ready for occupancy before the completion
of such construction, reconstruction, remodeling, or alteration and are certified
upon inspection to be safe for use or occupancy and to be in full compliance with
all applicable provisions of this code, other relevant codes and ordinances of the
Village, the owner’s plans as approved and any conditions attached to any
approvals issued pursuant to this code with respect to such structure or its
premises, a temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for a period not to
exceed six months from its date, which temporary certificate shall bear on its face,
in bold type, a statement of its temporary nature.
F. Certificate of Occupancy for Existing Uses. The Zoning Enforcement Officer may
issue a certificate of occupancy certifying the lawful existence and use of any
existing structure or use in the same manner, and subject to the same standards
and limitations, as authorized by this section with respect to new structures and
uses. Such certificate of occupancy shall be prima facie evidence of the facts
contained in it with respect to any structure or use as of the date of its issue and
remain effective for that purpose for so long as neither the use or structure nor the
applicable provisions of this code are changed.
G. Void Certificates. Any certificate of occupancy issued in violation of the provisions
of this code, whether intentionally, negligently, or innocently, shall be void ab initio
and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.
PART V: INTERPRETATIONS, APPEALS, AND VARIATIONS
9-11-13 INTERPRETATIONS
A. Authority. The Zoning Enforcement Officer, subject to the procedures, standards,
and limitations of this section, may render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this code and of any rule or regulation issued
pursuant to it.
B. Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this section is intended to
recognize that the provisions of this code, though detailed and lengthy, cannot
possibly address every specific situation to which they may have to be applied.
Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed by an interpretation of
the specific provisions of this code in light of the general and specific purposes for
which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority
herein established is an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not
intended to add to or change the essential content of this code but rather is
intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations. Applications for interpretations may be
filed by any person having an interest in the circumstances giving rise to the need
for an interpretation; provided, however, that interpretations shall not be sought by
any person based solely on hypothetical facts or where the interpretation would
have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for interpretations of this code shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code.
2. Action on Application. Within 30 days following the receipt of a properly
completed application for interpretation, the Zoning Enforcement Officer
shall inform the owner in writing of his or her interpretation, stating the
specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination is
based. The failure of the Zoning Enforcement Officer to act within 30 days,
or such further time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed to be
a decision denying the application rendered on the day following such 30-
day period.
3. Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Zoning Enforcement
Officer may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as provided in section
9-11-14 of this code.
E. Standards for Use Interpretations. The following standards shall govern the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from the
Zoning Enforcement Officer, in issuing use interpretations:
1. No use interpretation shall be given with respect to the residential districts.
2. Any use defined in section 9-12-13 of this code shall be interpreted as
therein defined.
3. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use or a
special permit use in any district to be established in any district in which
such use is not so listed.
4. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence
shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with each use
limitation established for that particular district.
5. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless such
use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in such district and is
more similar to such other uses than to uses permitted or specially
permitted in a more restrictive district.
6. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special use
in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any use
interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of
a special use permit for such use pursuant to section 9-11-17 of this code.
7. No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would
be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in question.
8. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, in rendering use
interpretations the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall be guided by the
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, Office of Management and
Budget (SIC), as such manual may be amended or replaced with
comparable manuals or guidelines. Many uses listed as permitted or
special uses in the use districts established by this code are preceded by
a numerical reference to the SIC Numerals in parentheses indicate that the
listed use includes one or more particular types of establishments in the
subject SIC category to the exclusion of others, and the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall determine whether the proposed use is most
similar to the listed use or uses rather than to any of the excluded uses in
rendering any use interpretation relative to such uses.
F. Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation. No use interpretation finding a particular
use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district shall authorize the
establishment of such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the
preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals
that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village including, but not
limited to, a special use permit, a certificate of zoning compliance, a building
permit, a certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
G. Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. Subject to an extension of time
granted by the Zoning Enforcement Officer pursuant to section 9-11-1 of this code,
no use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted
in a particular district shall be valid for a period longer than six months from the
date of issue unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion, or a certificate
of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period.
A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted
in a particular district shall be deemed to refer only to the particular use for which
it was issued, and such permit shall not be deemed to refer to any allegedly similar
use for which a separate use interpretation has not been issued. Such permit shall
automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for
which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six
consecutive months or more.
9-11-14 APPEALS TO ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
A. Authority. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals from, and
review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to act, of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer acting pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this
code and to that end the Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the same powers
and be subject to the same standards and limitations as the Zoning Enforcement
Officer with respect to any order, decision, or determination being appealed.
B. Purpose. The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, illconsidered,
or erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to avoid the need
for resort to legal action by establishing local procedures to review and correct
administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a means to subvert the clear
purposes, meanings, or intents of this code or the rightful authority of the Zoning
Enforcement Officer to enforce the requirements of this code. To these ends, the
reviewing body should give all proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied
in the language of this code and to the reasonable interpretations of that language
by those charged with the administration of this code.
C. Parties Entitled to Appeal. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved or adversely affected by an order,
decision, determination, or failure to act of the Zoning Enforcement Officer acting
pursuant to his or her authority and duties under this code.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
be filed not later than 30 days following the action being appealed and in
accordance with the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code.
2. Action by Zoning Enforcement Officer. Upon receipt of a properly
completed application for an appeal, the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
forthwith transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals the application together
with all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from
was taken.
3. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with section 9-11-10 of this
code.
4. Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 30 days following the close of
the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render a decision on
the appeal in the manner and form specified in section 9-11-2 of this code.
Such decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in whole or in part, the action
appealed from and may include such order or determination as, in the
opinion of the Board of Appeals, is proper to be made in the premises. The
failure of the Board of Appeals to act within such 30 days, or such further
time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision
denying the appeal.
E. Stay of Proceedings. An application for appeal properly filed pursuant to
subsection D of this section shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Zoning Enforcement Officer certifies to the
Zoning Board of Appeals after the application for appeal has been filed with the
Zoning Enforcement Officer that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in the Zoning Enforcement Officer’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board of Appeals or by the circuit
court on application, upon reasonable written notice to the Zoning Enforcement
Officer and on due cause shown.
F. Conditions and Limitations on Rights Granted by Appeal. In any case where this
code imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such right granted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeal shall be subject to such conditions and
limitations in the same manner and to the same extent as if secured without the
necessity of an appeal.
9-11-15 VARIATIONS
A. Authority. The Board of Trustees shall have the authority, by Ordinance duly
adopted, to grant variations from the provisions of this code, but only in compliance
with the procedures set forth in subsection D of this section and in those specific
instances enumerated in subsection E of this section and then only in accordance
with each of the standards enumerated in subsection F of this section.
B. Purpose. The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly circumscribed
means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen particular applications of
this code that create practical difficulties or particular hardships. When such
difficulties or hardships are more appropriate for remedy, if at all, pursuant to other
provisions of this code, the variation procedure is necessarily inappropriate.
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Variations. Applications for variations may be filed by the
owner of, or person having a contractual interest in, the lot.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for variations shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code.
2. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by
the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with section 9-11-10 of this
code.
3. Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within 35 days following the close of
the public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render its decision
recommending the granting or denying of the variation, in the manner and
form specified by section 9-11-2 of this code. The failure of the Board of
Appeals to act within 35 days, or such further time to which the owner may
agree, shall be deemed to be a decision recommending denial of the
variation.
4. Recommendations of Denial. Where the Zoning Board of Appeals has
recommended that a variation be denied, it shall not be granted except by
the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the Trustees then holding office.
E. Prohibited Variations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no
variation shall be granted that:
1. Is intended as a temporary measure only; or
2. Is greater than the minimum variation necessary to relieve the particular
hardship or practical difficulty demonstrated by the owner.
F. Standards for Variations.
1. General Standard. No variation shall be recommended or granted
pursuant to this section unless the owner shall establish that carrying out
the strict letter of the provisions of this code would create a particular
hardship or a practical difficulty.
2. Supplemental Standards. For the purpose of supplementing the above
standards, the Board of Appeals shall also, in making this determination
whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into
consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the owner
have been established by the evidence:
a. Unique Physical Conditions: The subject property is exceptional as
compared to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of
unique physical condition, including presence of an existing use,
structure or sign, whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular
or substandard shape or size; exceptional topographical features;
or other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent
in the subject property that amount to more than a mere
inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot
rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot.
b. Not Self-Created: The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the
result of any action or inaction of the owner or his predecessors in
title and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from
which a variation is sought or was created by natural forces or was
the result of governmental action, other than the adoption of this
title, for which no compensation was paid.
c. Denied Substantial Rights: The carrying out of the strict letter of the
provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner
of the subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by
owners of other lots subject to the same provision.
d. Not Merely Special Privilege: The alleged hardship or difficulty is
not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some
special privilege or additional right not available to owners or
occupants of other lots subject to the same provision, not merely an
inability to make more money from the sale of the subject property.
e. Code and Plan Purposes: The variation would not result in a use or
development of the subject property that would not be in harmony
with the general and specific purposes of which this title and the
provisions from which a variation is sought were enacted or the
general purposes and intent of the Official Comprehensive Plan.
f. Essential Character of the Area: The variation would not result in a
use or development on the subject property that:
i. Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development
value of property or improvements permitted in the vicinity;
ii. Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air
to the properties and improvements in the vicinity;
iii. Would substantially increase congestion in the public
streets due to traffic or parking;
iv. Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire;
v. Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area; or
vi. Would endanger the public health or safety.
g. No Other Remedy. There is no other means other than the
requested variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can
be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a
reasonable use of the subject property.
G. Variation Less Than Requested. A variation less than or different from that
requested may be granted when the record supports the owner’s right to some
relief but not to the relief requested.
H. Conditions on Variations. The Zoning Board of Appeals may recommend and the
Board of Trustees may impose such specific conditions and limitations concerning
use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this code upon the premises benefited
by a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse
effects upon other lots and improvements in the vicinity of the subject lot or upon
public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth in the
Ordinance granting the variation. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall
be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
variation.
I. Effect of Grant of Variation. The grant of a variation shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely
authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approval that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village
including, but not limited to, a certificate of zoning compliance, a building permit, a
certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
J. Limitations on Variations. Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer pursuant to section 9-11-1 of this code, no variation from the
provisions of this code shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a
building permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and
is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a certificate of occupancy
is issued and a use is commenced within that period.
A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or
development for which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease to
be of any force or effect if such construction or development shall be removed and
not replaced within six months following such removal.
PART VI: AMENDMENTS AND SPECIAL APPROVALS
9-11-16 AMENDMENTS
A. Authority. This code and the zoning map may be amended from time to time by
ordinance duly enacted by the Board of Trustees in accordance with the
procedures set out in this section.
B. Purpose. The amendment process established by this section is intended to
provide a means for making changes in the text of this code and in the zoning map
that have more or less general significance or application. It is not intended to
relieve particular hardships nor to confer special privileges or rights. Rather, it is
intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of this code and the zoning map in light
of changing, newly discovered, or newly important conditions, situations, or
knowledge.
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Amendments. An application for an amendment may be
filed by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, the owner of, or any person
having a contractual interest in, any lot to be affected by a proposed amendment
to the zoning map, or any person interested in a proposed amendment to the text
of this code.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for amendments shall be filed in accordance with
the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code; provided, however, that
amendments proposed by the Board of Trustees or the Plan Commission
shall not be subject to said section but shall be transmitted to the Zoning
Enforcement Officer in such form as may seem appropriate to the initiating
body.
2. Public Hearing. In any case where an application for amendment is
referred to the Plan Commission for a hearing, a public hearing shall be
set, noticed, and conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with
section 9-11-10 of this code.
3. Action by Plan Commission. Within 45 days following the conclusion of the
public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit to the Board of Trustees
its recommendation in the form specified by subsection 9-11-3 of this code.
The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 45 days following the
conclusion of such hearing, or such further time to which the owner may
agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the proposed
amendment as submitted.
4. Action by Board of Trustees; Protest. Within 60 days following the receipt
of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the application or,
by ordinance duly adopted, adopt the proposed amendment, with or without
modifications; provided, however, that in the event a duly signed and
acknowledged protest against a proposed amendment is filed with the
Village clerk before the adoption of such amendment by the owners of 20
percent or more of the frontage to be affected by the proposed amendment,
or by the owners of 20 percent or more of the frontage immediately
adjoining or across therefrom, or by the owners of 20 percent or more of
the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be affected, such amendment
shall not be passed except by a two-thirds vote of all the Trustees then
holding office.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such further
time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision
denying the application.
E. Standard for Amendments. The wisdom of amending the zoning map or the text
of this code is a matter committed to the sound legislative discretion of the Board
of Trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in determining
whether a proposed amendment should be granted or denied the Board of
Trustees should be guided by the principle that its power to amend this code is not
an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only when the public good demands
or requires the amendment to be made. In considering whether that principle is
satisfied in any particular case, the Board of Trustees should weigh the factors that
the owner is required to address in its application.
9-11-17 SPECIAL USE PERMITS
A. Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant special
use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special uses in the
regulations applicable to the district in which the lot is located.
B. Purpose. Special uses are those uses having some special impact or uniqueness
that requires a careful review of their location, design, configuration, and special
impact to determine, against fixed standards, the desirability of permitting their
establishment on any given site. They are uses that may or may not be appropriate
in a particular location depending on a weighing, in each case, of the public need
and benefit against the local impact and effect.
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Special Use Permits. An application for a special use
permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in,
the lot.
D. Procedure.
1. Application. Applications for special use permits shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code.
2. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted by
the Plan Commission in accordance with section 9-11-10 of this code.
3. Action by Plan Commission. Within 45 days following the conclusion of the
public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit to the Board of Trustees
its recommendation in the form specified by section 9-11-3 of this code,
recommending either granting the application for a special use permit;
granting the application subject to conditions, as specified in subsection F
of this section; or denying the application. The failure of the Plan
Commission to act within 45 days, or such further time to which the owner
may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the
proposed special use permit.
4. Action by Board of Trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt of the
recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the application or, by
ordinance duly adopted, shall grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act
within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying the special use permit. Where the Plan
Commission has recommended that a special use permit be denied, it shall
not be granted except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the Trustees
then holding office.
E. Standards for Special Use Permits.
1. General Standards. No special use permit shall be recommended or
granted pursuant to this section unless the owner shall establish that:
a. Is deemed necessary for the public convenience at that location;
b. Is so designed, located and proposed to be operated that the public
health, safety and welfare will be protected;
c. Will not cause substantial injury to the value of other lots in the
neighborhood in which it is located;
d. Conforms to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is to
be located, except as may be recommended by the Plan
Commission and approved by the Village Board or, except in the
case of a planned development; and
e. Owner can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Village, that it has
the capability and capacity, including, without limitation, the
technological, personnel, and financial resources, to complete the
project as proposed.
2. Special Standards for Specified Special Uses. When the district
regulations authorizing any special use in a particular district impose
special standards to be met by such use in such district, a permit for such
use in such district shall not be recommended or granted unless the owner
shall establish compliance with such special standards.
3. Considerations. In determining whether the owner’s evidence establishes
that the foregoing standards have been met, the Plan Commission shall
consider:
a. Public Benefit. Whether and to what extent the proposed use and
development at the particular location requested is necessary or
desirable to provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of
the public convenience or that will contribute to the general welfare
of the neighborhood or community.
b. Alternative Locations. Whether and to what extent such public
goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and
development at some other site or in some other area that may be
more appropriate than the proposed site.
c. Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether and to what extent all steps
possible have been taken to minimize any adverse effects of the
proposed use and development on the immediate vicinity through
building design, site design, landscaping, and screening.
F. Conditions on Special Use Permits. The Plan Commission may recommend and
the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations concerning use,
construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this code upon the premises benefited
by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize
adverse effects upon other lots and improvements in the vicinity of the subject lot
or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set forth
in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such condition or
limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds for
revocation of the special use permit.
G. Effect of Issuance of a Special Use Permit. The grant of a special use permit shall
not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but
shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for
any other permits or approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances
of the Village, including but not limited to a certificate of zoning compliance, a
building permit, a certificate of occupancy, and subdivision approval.
H. Limitations on Special Use Permits. Subject to an extension of time granted by
the Zoning Enforcement Officer pursuant to subsection 9-11-1 of this code, no
special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year unless a building
permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a certificate of occupancy is
issued and a use commenced within that period.
A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which
it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any
force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six
consecutive months or more.
Except when otherwise provided in the Ordinance granting a special use permit, a
special use permit shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use
and lot in question rather than the owner or operator of such use or lot.
I. Amendments to Special Use Permits. A special use permit may be amended,
varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the standards and
limitations provided in this section for its original approval.
9-11-18 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this section and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant special
use permits authorizing the development of planned unit developments, but only
in the districts where such developments are listed as an authorized special use.
B. Purpose. Planned unit developments are included in this code as a distinct
category of special use. As such, they are authorized for the same general
purposes as all other special uses. In particular, however, the planned unit
development technique is intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise applicable
substantive requirements based upon procedural protections providing for detailed
review of individual proposals for significant developments. This special regulatory
technique is included in this code in recognition of the fact that traditional bulk,
space, and yard regulations that may be useful in protecting the character of
substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriate preregulations
and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of lots or areas
that lend themselves to an individual, planned approach. Through the flexibility of
the planned unit development technique, the Village seeks to achieve the following
specific objectives:
1. Provide for the permanent preservation of more common open spaces and
better recreational opportunities or facilities than are required of
developments under the strict interpretation of this title.
2. To enable the development to better preserve natural vegetation, and
topographic and geological features than would otherwise be required of
developments under the strict interpretation of this title.
3. To encourage developers to invest in amenities that enhance the quality of
design and community character through the provision of better public
facilities.
4. To permit developers of commercial properties the flexibility to design their
projects to provide the maximum flexibility of design to meet the varying
conditions imposed by existing residential or nonresidential uses.
5. To permit developers to establish a quality that best meets the existing
character of the Village in transitional areas on the fringes.
C. Parties Entitled to Seek Planned Unit Development Approval. An application for a
special permit to permit a planned unit development may be filed by the owner of,
or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject lot.
D. Procedure.
1. Optional Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing any application for
planned unit development approval, the prospective owner may request a
pre-application conference with the Plan Commission. Such request shall
include a brief and general description of the nature, location and extent of
the proposed planned unit development; and a list of any professional
consultants advising the prospective owner with respect to the proposed
planned unit development. The meeting shall be held at a regularly
scheduled meeting and shall be open to the public.
The pre-application conference is not mandatory and does not require
formal application, fee, or filing of a planned unit development plat.
No final or binding action shall be taken at any pre-application conference
and any views expressed shall be deemed to be only preliminary and
advisory.
2. Preliminary Plat.
a. Purpose. The preliminary plat is intended to provide the owner an
opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope, character,
and nature of the entire proposed planned unit development without
incurring undue cost. The preliminary plat is the basis on which the
required public hearing is held, thus permitting public consideration
of the proposal at the earliest possible stage.
b. Application. Applications for approval of a preliminary plat shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of section 9-11-8 code.
c. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with section 9-
11-10 of this code.
d. Coordination With Subdivision Regulations. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Village’s subdivision regulations is proposed in
connection with a planned unit development, review of the tentative
plat of the proposed subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously
with review of the preliminary plat.
e. Action by Plan Commission. Within 60 days following the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall
transmit to the Board of Trustees its recommendation, in the form
specified by section 9-11-3 of this code, that the preliminary plat
either be approved, be approved subject to modifications, or not be
approved. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within 60 days,
or such further time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed
a recommendation for the approval of the preliminary plat as
submitted.
f. Action by Board of Trustees. Within 60 days following the receipt
of the recommendation of the Plan Commission or its failure to act
as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall deny the application
for approval of the preliminary plat, or shall refer it back to the Plan
Commission for further consideration of specified matters, or, by
ordinance duly adopted, shall approve the preliminary plat, with or
without modifications and conditions to be accepted by the owner
as a condition of such approval, and shall grant a special use permit
authorizing the proposed planned unit development and such
additional approvals as may be necessary to permit development
of the planned unit development as approved; provided, however,
that every such ordinance and special use permit shall be expressly
conditioned upon approval of the final plat in accordance with
paragraph D3 of this section and upon the permittee’s compliance
with all provisions of this code and the ordinance granting the
special use permit.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within 60 days, or such
further time to which the owner may agree, shall be deemed to be
a decision denying approval of the Preliminary Plat.
g. Effect of Preliminary Plat Approval. Approval of a preliminary plat
shall not constitute approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be
deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on the
preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat which
will be submitted for approval of the Village and subsequent
recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of these
regulations and conditions of the preliminary approval, if any.
h. Limitation on Preliminary Plat Approval. Subject to an extension of
time granted by the Zoning Enforcement Officer pursuant to
subsection 9-11-1 of this code, unless a final plat covering at least
the area designated in the preliminary plat as the first stage or unit
of the planned unit development has been filed within two years
from the date the Board of Trustees grants preliminary plat
approval, or in any case where the owner fails to file the final plat
and to proceed with development in accordance with the provisions
of this code, the preliminary plat approval shall automatically expire
and be rendered void and the Zoning Enforcement Officer shall,
without further direction, initiate an appropriate action to formally
revoke the special permit for all portions of the planned unit
development area that have not yet been completed.
i. Optional Submission of a Final Plat. The owner may, at his or her
option, submit a final plat for the proposed planned unit
development pursuant to the requirements of paragraph D3 of this
section simultaneously with the submission of the preliminary plat
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph D1 of this section. In
such case, the owner shall comply with all provisions of this code
applicable to submission of the preliminary plat and to submission
of the final plat. The Plan Commission and the Board of Trustees
shall consider such plans simultaneously and shall grant or deny
final plat approval in accordance with the provisions of paragraph
D.3 of this section.
3. Final Plat.
a. Purpose. The final plat is intended to particularize, refine, and
implement the preliminary plat and to serve as a working document
in development of a final plat. The final plat may be submitted for
the entire planned unit development or in stages as approved in the
preliminary plat.
b. Application. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, and within the
time limits established in Subparagraph D.2 of this section, the
owner shall file an application for final plat approval in accordance
with the requirements of section 9-11-8 of this code. The
application may include the entire area included in the approved
preliminary plat or one or more stages or units thereof in
accordance with a staging plan approved as part of the preliminary
plat. The application shall refine, implement, and be in substantial
conformity with the approved preliminary plat.
c. Public Meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with section 9-
11-10 of this code.
d. Coordination with Subdivision Regulations. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Village’s subdivision regulations is proposed in
connection with a planned development, review of the final plat of
proposed subdivision shall be carried out simultaneously with
review of the final plat.
e. Action by Plan Commission.
i. Evaluation. Within 60 days following the filing of an
application for approval of a final plat, the Plan Commission
shall review and act on the plan. The Plan Commission
shall set forth the reasons for the recommendation and said
recommendation shall set forth with particularity in what
respects the proposal would or would not be in the public
interest including, but not limited to, findings of fact on the
following:
(a) In what respects the proposed plan is or is not
consistent with the stated purpose of the planned
unit development regulations.
(b) The extent to which the proposed plan meets the
requirements and standards of the planned unit
development regulations set forth in section 9-11-18.
(c) The extent to which the proposed plan departs from
the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise
applicable to the subject lot, including, but not limited
to, the density, dimension, area, bulk and use, and
the reasons why such departures are or are not
deemed to be in the public interest.
(d) The physical design of the proposed plan and the
manner in which said design does or does not make
adequate provision for public services, provide
adequate control over vehicular traffic, provide for
and protect designated common open space and
further the amenities of light and air, recreation and
visual enjoyment.
(e) The relationship and compatibility, beneficial or
adverse, or the proposed plan to the adjacent
properties and neighborhood.
(f) The desirability of the proposed plan to physical
development, tax base and economic wellbeing of
the entire community.
(g) The conformity with the intent and spirit of the
comprehensive Village plan.
ii. Approval Based on Substantial Conformity. If the Plan
Commission finds substantial conformity between the Final
Plat and the approved preliminary plat and further finds the
final plat to be in all other respects complete and in
compliance with any and all conditions imposed by approval
of the preliminary plat and with the provisions of this code
and all other applicable federal, State, and Village codes,
ordinances, and regulations, it shall transmit the plan to the
Board of Trustees with its recommendation, in the form
specified in section 9-11-3 of this code, that the Board of
Trustees approve the final plat, with or without modifications
and conditions to be accepted by the owner as a condition
of approval. See section 9-12-13 of this code for the
definition of “substantial conformity.”
iii. Recommendation of Approval without Substantial
Conformity. If the Plan Commission finds that the final plat
lacks substantial conformity to the preliminary plat but merits
approval notwithstanding such lack of conformity and
otherwise conforms to the requirements of this code, it shall
transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees with its
recommendation, in the form specified in subsection 9-11-3
of this code, that the final plat be approved, with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the owner
as a condition of approval.
iv. Recommendation of Denial. If the Plan Commission finds
that the final plat is not in substantial conformity with the
approved preliminary plat and does not merit approval, or if
the Plan Commission requires modifications of a final plat
that are not accepted by the owner, the Plan Commission
shall transmit the plan to the Board of Trustees together with
its recommendation, in the form specified in subsection 9-
11-3 of this code, that the final plat not be approved.
v. Failure to Act. The failure of the Plan Commission to act
within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may
agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation to the
Board of Trustees to approve the final plat as submitted.
f. Action by Board of Trustees. Within 45 days following the receipt
of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act
as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall either:
i. Approval Based on Substantial Conformity. If the Plan
Commission has recommended approval of a final plat
pursuant to subparagraph D.3E.(ii) of this section, the Board
of Trustees shall, unless it specifically rejects one or more
of the findings of the Plan Commission on the basis of
expressly stated reasons, approve the final plat by a duly
adopted ordinance; or
ii. Approval Without Substantial Conformity. In any case other
than that specified in subparagraph D.3F.I. of this section,
the Board of Trustees may, if it finds that the final plat merits
approval and otherwise conforms to the requirements of this
code, approve the final plat by a duly adopted ordinance; or
iii. Referral Back to Plan Commission. In any case other than
that specified in subparagraph D.3F.I. of this section, the
Board of Trustees may refer the final plat back to the Plan
Commission for further consideration of specified matters.
iv. Denial. The Board of Trustees may deny final plat approval
if it finds, whether pursuant to a recommendation of the Plan
Commission or not, that the final plat is not in substantial
conformity with the approved preliminary plat and does not
merit approval or would only merit approval subject to
modifications or conditions that are not accepted by the
owner.
v. Failure to Act. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act
within 60 days, or such further time to which the owner may
agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying final plat
approval.
g. Conditions on Final Plat Approval. The approval of any final plat
may be granted with or without modifications and conditions to be
accepted by the owner as a condition of approval.
h. Recordation of the Final Plat. The ordinance approving the final plat
shall be effective only upon recording of the final plat and supporting
data with the county recorder of deeds. The recording of the final
plat shall inform all who deal with the planned unit development of
the restrictions placed upon the land and act as a zoning control
device.
i. Building Permits. No building permits shall issue and no
construction may occur until the final plat has been approved and
recorded with the county recorder of deeds.
E. Standards for Planned Unit Developments.
1. Special Use Permit Standards. No special use permit for a planned unit
development shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this section
unless the owner shall establish that the proposed development will meet
each of the standards made applicable to special use permits pursuant to
section 9-11-17 of this code.
2. Additional Standards for All Planned Unit Developments. No special use
permit for a planned unit development shall be recommended or granted
unless the owner shall establish that the proposed development will meet
each of the following additional standards:
a. Variance from Applicable District Regulations. The degree to which
the development differs in its performance from what would be
possible under the normal standards of the district in which it is
located.
b. Promotion of Character. The degree to which the development
exhibits extra care and attention to details which enhance the
character of the development and the Village that sets the
development apart from projects that could be built without the aid
of this section.
c. Architectural Design. The design of the development should be
consistent with the surrounding properties. The Plan Commission
should have review materials presented by the developer indicating
that the credits sought are based in real investments in excess of
what is required under the minimum standards of the ordinance.
d. Amenities. The degree to which the development will preserve
critical natural environments, restore or mitigate degraded or
distressed environments, alleviated off-site problems, or provided
other improvements that benefit all residents of the community.
e. Landscaping. The Plan Commission should review both an
inventory of natural features on the site and plans demonstrating
preservation of existing resources and integration of new
landscaping on the property.
f. Comprehensive Plan. A planned unit development must conform
with the intent and spirit of the proposals of the Village’s
comprehensive plan.
g. Minimum Area. The site of the planned unit development must be
under single ownership and/or unified control and be not less than
four acres in area.
h. Compatibility. The uses permitted in a planned unit development
must be of a type and so located so as to exercise no undue
detrimental influence upon surrounding properties.
i. Setbacks. The required minimum setbacks and building lines shall
be at least equal in width or depth to that of the adjacent zoning
district. In no case shall the rear building line be closer than 25 feet
to any adjacent property in the E-1, R-1, and R-2 districts for living
units and accessory buildings. Business-commercial buildings
located in a residential planned unit development shall be located
at least 40 feet from any lot line not abutting a public street.
j. Parking Requirements. Adequate parking shall be provided.
Except for the ORI district, parking shall be provided at a minimum
of 1.5 spaces per living unit, with an additional space per 300
square feet of business-commercial use and an additional space
per 400 square feet of enclosed recreational use.
k. Traffic. Adequate provision shall be made to minimize traffic
congestion in the public streets.
l. Density Increase. The Plan Commission may recommend, and the
Village Board may approve, an increase in density of up to 20
percent over the density allowed in the district in which the planned
unit development is located based on the developer's ability to
substantially improve the quality of the project in light of the goals
and standards in this section and this code, including without
limitation preservation of natural resources and unique open space
area, provision of special recreational facilities, preservation and/or
restoration of unique buildings or structures, and provisions for
underground parking facilities, alleviation of traffic congestion, and
provision of pedestrian access to schools and parks. The density
calculations shall include the gross land area of the property
excluding area that is dedicated for public street purposes.
m. Building Height. Any building within a planned unit development
shall not exceed 37 feet, except in the ORI district. In addition,
where a property abuts E-1, R-1, and R-2 districts, the building shall
not exceed one foot in height for every two feet of setback from the
property line of the subject tract, except in the ORI district.
n. Building and Lot Coverage. The Plan Commission may
recommend, and the Village Board may approve, limitations on
building and lot coverage based on the goals set forth in the
comprehensive plan.
o. Tax Impact Study. The Plan Commission and Village Board may
consider the impact of the development on the Village, school
districts, parks, and special districts in the area as set forth in the
tax impact study provided to the Village as part of the application
for the planned unit development.
p. Municipal Facilities. Details of sanitary sewer, water, storm sewer,
and facilities that will serve the planned unit development shall be
considered as part of the planned unit development application.
q. Dedications. Land to be dedicated or reserved for public schools,
parks, and municipal purposes shall be depicted on the planned
unit development plans. Evidence of consultation with all public
entities with jurisdiction over the property shall be provided as part
of the application. At least 10 acres of open space and/or
recreational space shall be dedicated for each 1,000 persons,
which land shall not be limited to flood plains or wetlands.
r. Lighting. Lighting shall comply with otherwise applicable lighting
regulations for the district in which the property is located.
s. Compliance with Subdivision Regulations and Plat Act. All planned
unit developments, whether or not they are by definition subject to
the Village’s subdivision regulations or the Illinois Plat Act, shall
comply with all standards, regulations and procedures of the
subdivision regulations and the Plat Act except as varied by the
board of trustees pursuant to subsection G or the applicable section
of the subdivision regulations.
t. Association Documents. A homeowners or other owners’
association shall be formed to own, operate, and maintain common
and community facilities. The form of the association declaration
shall be filed with the final plan and shall be subject to the review
and approval of the Village attorney.
4. Additional Standards for Specific Planned Unit Developments. Where the
district regulations authorizing any planned development use in a particular
district impose standards to be met by such planned unit development in
such district, a special permit for such development shall not be
recommended or granted unless the owner shall establish compliance with
such special standards.
F. Conditions on Planned Unit Development Approvals. The approval of either a
preliminary plat or a final plat may be conditioned on such matters as the approving
body may find necessary to prevent or minimize any possible adverse effects of
the proposed planned unit development, or to ensure its compatibility with
surrounding uses and development and its consistency with the general purposes,
goals, and objectives of this code, the Village’s subdivision regulations, and the
official comprehensive plan; provided, however, that no such condition of final plat
approval shall impair the rights granted by preliminary plat approval. Such
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the approval in
question. Violation of any such condition or limitation shall be a violation of this
code and shall constitute grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the
planned unit development.
G. Authority to Vary Regulations. The planned unit development may depart from
strict conformance with the required density, dimension, area, bulk, use, and other
regulations for the standard zoning districts and other provisions of this code to the
extent specified in the preliminary land use and zoning plat and documents
authorizing the planned unit development so long as the planned unit development
will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort, or
general welfare.
H. Time Schedule. The president and Board of Trustees shall consider the planned
unit development subject to revocation if construction falls more than two years
behind the schedule filed with the final plat. Extensions in the building schedule
may be granted by the Plan Commission. With the exception of the installation of
the final one inch bituminous concrete roadway surface, all public improvements
within each phase of the planned unit development shall be completed within two
years of final plat approval for that phase.
I. Adjustments to Final Plat During Development. The planned unit development
project shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded plat and
all supporting data. The recorded final plat and supporting data together with all
recorded amendments shall be binding on the owners, their successors and
assigns and shall limit and control the use of premises and location of structures
in the planned unit development project as set forth therein.
1. Major Changes. Changes which include increases in density, height of
buildings, reductions of proposed open space, changes in the development
schedule or changes in the final governing agreements, provisions or
covenants or other changes which change the concept or intent of the
development, may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary
plat and supporting data and following the "preliminary approval" steps and
subsequent amendment of the final land use and zoning plat.
All changes to the final plat shall be recorded with the county recorder of
deeds as amendments to the final plat or reflected in the recording of a new
"corrected" final plat.
2. Minor Changes. The Village Board may approve minor changes in the
planned unit development which do not change the concept or intent of the
development without going through the "preliminary approval" steps. Minor
changes shall be any change not defined as a major change.
J. Amendments to Final Plat Following Completion of Development. After completion
of a planned unit development, an approved final plat may be amended, varied, or
altered in the same manner and subject to the same limitations, as provided for
major adjustments in subsection I of this section.
K. Impact Fees. See title 10 of this code for applicable impact fee regulations.
9-11-19 SITE PLAN REVIEW (ORI DISTRICT):
A. Intent. In order to exercise a more orderly control of land development within the
ORI District, the Village hereby establishes a site plan review process. It is
recognized that the very nature of a development creates potential for traffic
generation problems, overcrowding, and adverse environmental effects. The
Village intends to subject all development not undergoing a special use permit or
planned unit development process within the ORI District to site plan review so
that all the meaning and intent of this code and all the provisions thereof are
complied with.
B. Procedure. A written application for site plan review shall be submitted to the
Zoning Enforcement Officer who will schedule the item for review by the Plan
Commission. 10 copies of the site plan shall be submitted at least 10 days prior
to the Plan Commission meeting at which the site plan will be reviewed. The Plan
Commission shall recommend approval or denial of the site plan, with or without
conditions, or may defer the item for further study. Once a recommendation is
made, the site plan shall be forwarded to the Village Board for consideration and
approval. Consultation with the appropriate Village staff and consultants is
encouraged throughout this process to insure a minimum of delay. The Village
Board may approve, approve with conditions or deny the site plan.
C. Site Plan Details. The site plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following detail
information:
1. A base map, drawn to scale, showing all lot boundaries and dimensions
and a written description of the property;
2. The area (square footage) of the following must be included on all site
plans:
a. Total lot area;
b. Total building area;
c. Total landscaped area;
d. Total area devoted to parking lots and driveways;
e. Total area of interior parking lot landscaping.
3. Location and dimensions of existing and proposed buildings and
structures, existing zoning and land use within 200 feet of site, including
adjacent lot lines and significant features and buildings on adjoining
properties;
4. The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed parking lots and
drives, roadways and rights of way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs,
refuse disposal areas, bicycle parking areas, fences, free standing
electrical equipment, free standing HVAC/mechanical equipment and other
free standing structural features;
5. Names and addresses of owner, applicant, planner, architect, engineer,
and landscape architect, as appropriate.
6. Scale, north arrow, date;
7. Title of the project or property;
8. Ground elevations, existing and proposed, type of foundation elevations on
all adjacent structures;
9. Location of flood plains, existing vegetation, fences, walls, etc.;
10. Vehicular, service and pedestrian access, including driveways, sidewalks,
curbs, street pavement markings, traffic signals and on-site parking,
circulation signage and curb cuts within 200 feet of site;
11. Off-street parking and loading areas, including number of spaces and
dimensions;
12. Lighting standards, including location, size, height, illumination and
intensity;
13. Outdoor storage areas, if any;
14. Waste disposal areas, including type of containers, bins, dumpsters, etc.,
and enclosure methods;
15. Engineering, drainage, grading, flood plain, and on-site water detention
areas;
16. Horizontal elevations of all proposed structures, including detailed
description of exterior construction materials. Elevations shall represent
those colors which will be utilized in the design;

but not limited to:
a. Performance standards evaluation pursuant to section 9-9-9;
b. Traffic impact analysis;
c. Market research analysis;
d. Flood plain mitigation measures;
e. Erosion control measures.
18. Timetable for construction of proposed improvements.
D. Design Criteria. Approval of site plans shall be based upon conformity to zoning
regulations as well as general conformance to overall site design criteria. A
developer should seek to integrate the following design characteristics into those
plans submitted for site plan approval.
1. Integration and Compatibility. The overall design shall integrate
neighborhood and site characteristics into a compatible expression of
building mass, scale, color and circulation.
2. Minimalization of Impacts. Spatial designs should minimize the impacts of
traffic, noise, reflected light, debris, and other undesirable effects of
development upon abutting properties and the neighborhood as a whole.
3. Architectural Innovation. Developers should seek to provide innovative
design of structures by varying vertical planes of building facades and/or
by varying the elevation of roof lines.
4. Loading/Refuse Area. Design of loading and refuse areas should be
sensitive to aesthetic concerns and provide screening compatible with
abutting properties. Such loading and refuse areas should not be visible
from public roads.
5. Parking Lots. Parking lots and driveways shall be designed to safely and
effectively circulate vehicles throughout the site. When appropriate, cross
easements should be provided between adjoining properties to allow for
circulation of vehicles.
6. Vehicle Access and Curb Cuts. Vehicular systems for both on-site and offsite
traffic should be designed in a manner which facilitates smooth
progression of movement, yet is sensitive to other design considerations
such as pedestrian activity and off-street parking. Curb cuts shall be
located to safely and efficiently allow vehicle ingress and egress to the site.
The use of shared curb cuts and cross easements shall be provided when
appropriate. One curb cut shall be allowed for ingress/egress unless
specific documentation is provided demonstrating the need for additional
curb cuts.
7. Pedestrian Circulation. Site and building design shall accommodate
pedestrian circulation on-site from parking areas, plazas, open space, and
public rights of way. Pedestrian and vehicular circulation shall be separated
to the greatest extent possible.
8. Uniform Signage. Signage shall be designed to provide compatibility with
building form, shape, and color. Signage shall be uniform or complimentary
in color and overall design. Signage shall not conflict with signage from
adjoining properties. All signs must comply with otherwise applicable sign
regulations.
9. Open Space. Design of any development shall provide for a maximum use
of open space, particularly along the perimeter of the site, in parking lots,
and near the building foundation. Larger developments should include
designs which allow for centralized open space containing
detention/retention ponds, passive recreation areas, bike/pedestrian paths,
and other amenities which will serve the development.
10. Detention/Retention Ponds. When appropriate, detention and retention
ponds should be designed to provide for shared storage between
properties. Ideally, such shared storage should include the greatest land
area possible.
11. Lighting. On-site lighting standards shall be compatible with architectural
and spatial designs, and shall provide for safe illumination on the site for
vehicles and pedestrians.
12. Planned Unit Development Criteria. If a parcel lies within a planned unit
development, the site plan review will insure that the design criteria
approved for the planned unit development will be incorporated into the
individual parcel's site plan. Where the approved planned unit development
criteria are moot on a particular design element, the standards described
in this Section may be applied.
E. Site Landscaping Design Criteria. A landscape plan must accompany any
application for site approval. Landscape plans shall meet the requirements of
section 9-9-7 of this code.
F. Performance Guarantee. As a condition of approval, the Plan Commission may
recommend that the applicant be required to file with the Village Attorney a letter
of credit or a performance guarantee approved by the Village Attorney to insure
completion of approved landscaping, fencing, parking, loading, drainage, and all
other specified items of the site plan. The amount of the performance guarantee
and the required completion date shall be recommended by the Village Engineer
based on current costs and set by the Village Board. If, upon inspection of the
completed project by the Zoning Enforcement Officer it is found that the conditions
of the site plan have been met, the performance bond shall be released to the
applicant.
If the applicant does not complete the development of the items specified in the
site plan within the time specified in its bond or other security, the Zoning
Enforcement Officer shall give written notice to the applicant and the surety or
other guarantor. If site development in conformity with the conditions of the site
plan have not been completed 30 days prior to the expiration of the performance
guarantee, the Village will take action as is necessary to insure completion in
conformity with the conditions of the site plan within the time period specified. If
the applicant can demonstrate that adversities not of his making prevented such
completion, the Village Board may permit him to extend the performance
guarantee for an additional specified period of time.
G. Amendments to Site Plan. The required site plan and timetable may be amended
by the Village Board after review and recommendation of the Plan Commission.
H. Building Permits. Building permits for earth moving, construction, alternation, or
any other purposes shall not be issued for a site until a site plan is approved by
the Village Board.

signs and other advertising structures. Such bond shall indemnify and save
harmless the advertising structures. Such bond shall indemnify and save harmless
the Village from any and all damages, judgments, costs or expense which the
Village may incur or suffer by reason of the granting of the permit. An insurance
policy, saving the Village harmless, shall be considered sufficient. However,
neither the bond nor the insurance provisions set forth herein shall be applicable if
the sign to be erected or constructed shall not be so situated as to create any
liability to the Village. The determination as to possible liability shall be made by

O. Violations. If the Village shall at any time find that any sign is unsafe or insecure,
or is a menace to the public, or has been constructed or erected or is being
maintained in violation of the provisions of this code, in addition to all other
remedies available to the Village, the building department may provide written
notice to the sign contractor (if the sign erection is incomplete or improper), to the
person to which the sign permit had been issued or, if the permittee cannot be
located within 30 days, to the owner of the premises on which the sign is located.
If the notified party fails to remove or alter the sign so as to comply with the
standards herein set forth within 10 days after notice, the Village may remove, or
alter such sign to comply. Temporary signs must be removed immediately upon
notice of the Village. The cost of sign repair or removal performed on privately
owned signs at the order of the Village in conformance with the provisions of this
Chapter shall be the joint and several liability of the following:
1. The sign contractor, if the sign erection was improper or not complete at
the time notice of violation was given, and shall be collected from his bond;
or
2. The sign owners; or
3. If the sign owner cannot be located within 30 days, then the premises
owner.
In the event of failure by any party to reimburse the Village within 60 days for costs
incurred for repair or removal ordered by the building department, the Village
Board shall certify the charges for repair or removal to the Village Attorney or the
Village Clerk who will then be authorized to file a notice of lien in the appropriate
office of the Recorder of Deeds to foreclose this lien; and to sue the owner of the
real estate, or sign permittee, or their agents, in a civil action to recover the money
due for the foregoing services, plus all expenses, as is hereinafter more fully
described, and reasonable attorney fees to be fixed by the court. Any such

title.
A. Statement of Justification. In applying for a variation from the provisions of this title,
the applicant shall demonstrate in writing that each of the following criteria is
satisfied:
1. The terms and provisions of the Illinois Plat Act have been met; and
2. That a hardship would result if compliance of this title were required.
B. Limitations on Variations. No variation granted pursuant to this section shall relieve
an applicant from complying with every other requirement of law. Nothing provided
in this section shall be construed or applied as authority of the board of trustees to
vary any requirement of law other than the provisions of this title.
C. Conditions May Be Imposed. In authorizing a variation, the board of trustees may
impose such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of
the proposed subdivision or development as it may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, deem necessary in the public interest, and may require the posting of a
performance guarantee to insure compliance with the conditions imposed.
D. Procedure for Review of Variation Requests. Applications for variations of the
provisions of this title shall be reviewed concurrently with the related subdivision
application, except as otherwise provided by the board of trustees on a case by
case basis. Every such application for variation, however, shall be heard at a
public meeting of the plan commission, which shall formulate a recommendation
regarding such application for variation as part of its recommendation on the
subdivision itself. Thereafter, the board of trustees shall consider the variation at a
public meeting. An application for a variation shall be deemed to be a waiver by
the applicant of any prescribed time limitations on the plan commission or board of
trustees in their respective reviews of the subdivision application affected by the
variation request.

reviewed by the plan commission and the board of trustees in accordance with the
standards and procedures set forth in this title, and the following additional general
standards.
1. The subdivision is consistent with the zoning code.
2. The subdivision will not create a nonconforming building, nonconforming use, or
nonconforming lot, nor will the subdivision create, increase, or extend any existing
nonconformity.
3. The subdivision will accommodate development on a lot that will comply with
required setbacks and will not result in the substantial loss of existing trees or the
significant alteration of the existing topography on the lot.
4. The subdivision will not substantially modify or threaten the integrity of natural
resources, including without limitation existing steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands,
mature trees, or the use of public open spaces.
5. The proposed development of the subdivision will not result in an increase in the
storm water release rate from the subdivision.

should be approved, approved with modifications or conditions, or disapproved;
and shall transmit such recommendation to the board of trustees. The plan
commission may recommend approval of a plat subject to certain conditions or
modifications as are deemed necessary in the interests and needs of the
community. The failure of the plan commission to act within the time period
specified in this subsection, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation of the plan commission to
disapprove the preliminary plat.
D. Action by Board of Trustees. The board of trustees, within 30 days after its next
regularly scheduled meeting following the transmission of a recommendation by
the plan commission on an application for preliminary plat approval, shall
disapprove the preliminary plat or shall approve it by ordinance or resolution duly

preliminary plat.
E. Effect of Approval. The approval of a preliminary plat by the board of trustees is
strictly tentative in nature, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout
as submitted. Approval of the preliminary plat shall be deemed solely as
permission for the applicant to prepare a final plat of subdivision, including
detailed plans and specifications for the subdivision and public improvements in
accordance with the preliminary plat and within the requirements of this title.
Approval of a preliminary plat shall not entitle the applicant to any other approval
or issuance of any permit until after all of the standards and procedures for such
other approval or issuance of a permit have been satisfied.
F. Limitation on Preliminary Plat Approval. Every approval by the board of trustees
of a preliminary plat of subdivision shall be effective for a maximum period of 12
months after the date of approval unless, pursuant to a written application
therefor filed by the applicant before the expiration of the preliminary plat
approval, the board of trustees grants an extension of that 12-month period. If,
within the 12-month period, no extension of time has been granted by the board
of trustees and no application for approval of a final plat of subdivision has been
filed with the Village, then the applicant must resubmit an application for approval
of a preliminary plat for full review of the plan commission and board of trustees.
G. Statement of Disapproval. If the plan commission or board of trustees shall
disapprove a preliminary plat pursuant to this section, then the plan commission

Grading plan for each lot and area shall be submitted for review and approval by the
village engineer. Grading shall include the existing topography, establishment of lot and
area grades and building elevations which are consistent with the existing ground line,
surrounding properties and affected public properties. It is the purpose of the grading
plan to develop a plan which does not adversely affect the surrounding properties and
provides an individual lot or grading which makes ample provision for surface water
drainage between individual lots and areas. Standards of such grading and
establishment of elevations shall be as approved by the village engineer.
10-3-5 LAND DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS
A. Drainage Ways:
1. Drainage ways shall be considered as all natural or manmade lakes, rivers,
canals, streams, ditches, swales and the like which carry a flow of water
continually or intermittently.
2. Drainage ways and the area on either side of the centerline of said drainage
way shall be preserved within the limits of the floodway or one hundred (100)
year flood as determined by appropriate date of record.
3. Drainage ways are to remain in natural state, or may be altered or relocated
upon a showing of necessity if they comply with the requirements of the
Village, Illinois Department of Transportation Division of Water Resources,
U.S. Department of Army Engineers and all other applicable Federal, State or
local permits or ordinances.
B. Woodlands:
1. A dense aggregate of trees, shrubs, brush and vegetation shall be classified
as a woodland.
2. Within the woodland, a further subdivision of trees and shrubs will be made as
follows:
a. Trees or shrubs with diameter of zero to six inches (0" - 6") will be classed
as shrubs.
b. Trees will be woody perennial plants over six inches (6") and further
designated as trees six inches to fifteen inches (6" - 15") and trees fifteen
inches (15") and over.
3. Preservation of the various classifications of the trees and shrubs, as well as
reforestation will accrue additional density allocations on the remaining land
based on a variable ratio dependent on tree and shrub sizes.
C. Wetlands:
1. Any contemplated improvement or alteration or secondary use of a wetland
shall comply with federal and state laws and regulations.
2. The Village will support the preservation of any wetland that has significant
flora, fauna or flood mitigating characteristics or has the potential to be
improved to such uses.
3. Wetlands that are of a backwater or intermittent category or an isolated or
segmented portion of a larger area may be considered as a category other
than in subsection C2 of this section.
4. If the significance of the wetland is not mutually agreed upon by the Village
and other parties, the Village may use its resource to determine the
significance of the wetland at the expense of those who are requesting the
alteration of the wetlands.
5. Any action by the Village does not abrogate the requirement for complying
with all federal, state and county regulations or permits where applicable.
D. Floodplains: The Village will utilize its floodplain regulations, the FEMA flood
insurance requirements, the department of the army corps of engineers and the
Illinois department of transportation division of water resources, permit procedures
or any other federal, state, county or regional material, to adequately regulate the
areas in floodway, floodplain or flood hazard zones.
E. Prime Agricultural Land: The Village recognizes the desirability of preserving prime
agricultural land as appropriate.
F. Wildlife Management: For every acre or fraction thereof, land converted to a
practical, manageable protection and unencroachable wildlife habitat, the
remaining land may have the allowable per acre density increased by five percent
(5%).
G. Lakes and Ponds:
1. Natural lakes and ponds will remain with their existing configuration unless data
is provided showing any proposed alterations of shoreline, area or depth
enhances the lake or pond. Any proposed alterations must be able to secure
and comply with all applicable Federal, State and Municipal permits and
regulations.
2. Lakes and ponds solely within a single ownership shall, upon development of
the adjacent land, provide a certain percentage of the surface area and
shoreline for common use by the adjacent property owners as well as the
general residents of Island Lake.
3. The Village reserves the option to secure, with adequate compensation, any
lake or pond for use and benefit of the residents of Island Lake.
4. Figure I is to be used as a guideline to determine the ratio of public/private
utilization.
H. Aquifer Recharge Areas:
1. Acceptable methods or sources of aquifer recharge would be by means of:
pits; wells; irrigation; increasing the wetted area; overland flooding; contouring.
2. At the present time within the corporate limits and jurisdictional limits of Island
Lake, there are sufficient major rivers, streams, lakes and ponds, marshes and
drainage systems that there will be no requirement for developers to provide
recharge areas. However, should a property have a significant unusual feature
that lends itself to a classic application of a recharge method, the Village will
show interest in the utilization of the feature for a recharge facility.
10-3-6 PERFORMANCE SECURITY
A. General Requirement. The applicant shall submit to the Village security for the
public and other improvements required for the new subdivision in accordance
with the requirements of this section.
B. Amount of Performance Security. Prior to the issuance of any building permit or
commencement of any construction on the property, the applicant shall deliver to
the Village performance security, in a form approved by the village attorney and
issued by a financial institution acceptable to the Village, in the amount of 110%
of (1) the village engineer’s estimate of the costs for constructing and installing all
of the public and other required improvements or (2) the actual cost as shown by
all contracts for construction and installation of all of the public and other required
improvements, whichever is greater. The performance security shall be for the
purpose of insuring the construction of all of the public and other required
improvements in accordance with the final engineering plans and all applicable
requirements of law.
C. Terms of Performance Security. The performance security shall remain in effect
at all times until all of the public and other required improvements have been
approved by the village engineer and the public improvements have been
accepted by the Village pursuant to section 10-3-8. If the public and other
required improvements have not been completed and accepted or approved by
the Village 30 days prior to the date on which the security by its terms is to
expire, then the applicant shall deliver on or before such date replacement
security which by its terms shall extend through the date the public and other
required improvements are accepted or approved by the Village. If the applicant
fails to so deliver such security, then the Village shall have the right at such time,
without prior notice to applicant, to draw down the full amount of the existing
security.
D. Draw on Performance Security. If the applicant fails or refuses to complete the
construction of any of the public or other required improvements covered by the
performance security, or fails to correct any defect or deficiency in such
improvements upon request by the Village, or fails to increase the security upon
the Village’s request, or in any other manner fails or refuses to meet fully the
obligations under the performance security, or the applicable development
agreement, then the Village may, in its sole and absolute discretion, draw on or
retain all or any part of the performance security.
E. Partial Reduction or Increase of Performance Security. The applicant may make
a written request to the village engineer to partially reduce the amount of the
approved performance security. The village engineer shall be authorized, in his
or her sole discretion, to approve a partial reduction in the amount of the
performance security, provided that the public and other required improvements
for which the reduction is sought have been completed, inspected, and approved
by the village engineer. In no event shall the amount of the performance security
be reduced to a level that (i) would not allow the Village to complete the
installation of the public and other improvements required for the subdivision, in
the sole and absolute opinion of the village engineer or (ii) is less than the
guaranty security required by section 10-3-9. In the event that the Village
determines that the performance security is not sufficient to cover the costs of the
remaining public improvements, the applicant shall be required to increase the
amount of the performance security in an amount determined by the Village to
secure the remaining public improvements.
F. Release of Performance Security. Following the village engineer’s certification
that all public and other required improvements included in the security have
been completed to the satisfaction of the village engineer, and the Village’s
acceptance of all public improvements in accordance with all requirements of
section 10-3-8 including without limitation the delivery of satisfactory guaranty
security or all public improvements, the Village shall release the security.
10-3-7 INSPECTION OF WORK
The public and other required improvements shall not be deemed completed until the
village engineer, or the Village’s appointed inspector, has inspected the public and
other required improvements, determined that the approved engineering plans have
been satisfactorily implemented, and has issued a written declaration of completion to
the applicant. Upon written request from the applicant, and promptly thereafter, at a
time mutually agreeable to applicant and the village engineer or its appointed
inspector, the Village engineer or its appointed inspector shall inspect the public and
other required improvements and report its findings as to acceptability and
completeness to applicant. The village engineer shall prepare a punch list of items, if
any, to be performed or corrected and shall fix a time within which applicant shall
perform or correct the items listed thereon. Following applicant's performance or
correction of the said items, the village engineer or its appointed inspector shall make
another review of the public and other required improvements, and either issue a
written declaration declaring the public and other required improvements to be
complete or present another punch list to the applicant.
10-3-8 DEDICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS
The acceptance of the public improvements shall be made only by the adoption of a
resolution by the board of trustees of the Village after there has been filed with the
Village a certification by the village engineer stating that (i) the public and other
required improvements have been completed and the public improvements are in all
respects in satisfactory condition for acceptance, (ii) two sets of “as-built” plans of the
public improvements constructed have been received, (iii) satisfactory guaranty
security for the public improvements has been delivered to the Village in accordance
with this title; and (iv) all surveying monuments have been placed and after the
applicant has paid to the Village all monies due and owing by the applicant to the
Village. Further, the Village shall have no obligation to accept the public improvements
if the applicant has failed in any respect to comply strictly with this title. Prior to
acceptance of the public improvements, the applicant shall, at applicant’s own cost
and expense, remove, discharge, or otherwise dispose of any and all liens and other
encumbrances on the public improvements. The applicant shall convey and transfer
title to the public improvements by bill of sale to the Village. The applicant shall deliver
such documents to the Village, together with any other documents deemed necessary
by the Village, including, without limitation, non-exclusive easements on, over, and
across the property to enable the Village to access the public improvements. All such
documents shall be acceptable to the Village in form and substance.
10-3-9 GUARANTY SECURITY
The applicant shall provide to the Village guaranty security, in an amount equal to ten
percent (10%) of the actual cost of construction of all the public improvements, the
form and substance of which shall be acceptable to the Village. The guarantee security
shall insure the Village against any defects in the work performed and materials used
in the construction of the public improvements for two years after the Village’s
acceptance of the public improvements. Such security, as approved by the Village,
shall be delivered to the Village prior to acceptance of the public improvements.
