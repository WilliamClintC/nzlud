The issuance of any such permits shall be within the sole discretion of the city; and in acting upon any application for such permit, the city shall take into consideration the number of outstanding permits or other licenses for the particular type of operation or activity contemplated by the applicant, the safety of the lives and property of the inhabitants of the city and all persons operating on or from such airport, the condition of the airport, and the desirability and suitability of such commercial operation upon and from such airport.

(f)    All permits issued under this section shall expire on December 31 following the date of issuance. Permits granted under this section shall not be transferable.

(g)   If the type of operation contemplated in the application for a commercial permit involves the use or operation of an aircraft upon or from the airport, the applicant shall submit with the application a copy of a certificate of insurance showing that such applicant has in force for the entire period for which a permit is sought, property damage insurance in an amount not less than $100,000.00 and public liability, personal injury insurance in an amount not less than $100,000.00 for injury to one person and not less than $300,000.00 for total injuries resulting from one accident. Such insurance shall be of standard type, shall cover the aircraft of the applicant while operated by the applicant or another with the applicant’s permission, and shall cover the applicant while operating in the aircraft.

(h)   A permit issued under this section may be revoked by the city for the violation of any of the terms of this section; provided, however, that no permit shall be revoked until the holder of such permit has been given notice in writing of the violation and given a reasonable opportunity to comply with the provisions of this section.

(1)   Such vehicles serve as a breeding ground for flies, mosquitoes, rats and other insects and rodents;

(2)   They are a danger to persons, particularly children because of broken glass, sharp metal protrusions, insecure mounting on blocks, jacks or supports and because they are a ready source of fire and explosion;

(3)   They encourage pilfering and theft, and constitute a blighting influence upon the area in which they are located thereby causing a loss in property value to surrounding property;

(4)   They constitute a fire hazard in that they block access for fire equipment to adjacent buildings and structures.

(b)   Definitions. The following words and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them:

(1)   Inoperable means a condition of being junked, wrecked, wholly or partially dismantled, discarded, abandoned, or unable to perform the functions or purposes for which it was originally constructed, or for which it may have been subsequently modified.

(2)   Vehicle means any automobile, truck, tractor, aircraft or motorcycle, which as originally built contained an engine or designed to contain an engine, regardless of whether it contains an engine at any other time.

(c)   Prohibitions and exceptions. It shall be unlawful for any person or his agent, either as owner, lessee, tenant, or occupant of any real property within the city to park, store, or deposit, or permit to be parked, stored, or deposited thereon an inoperable vehicle, unless:

(2)   The person is a duly licensed automobile junk dealer.

(3)   The inoperable vehicle is stored on property located in either an I-1 or the I-2 zoning district and completely enclosed by screening of not less than six feet in height.

Provided, however, that nothing in this section authorizes the maintenance of a public nuisance.

(d)   Presumptions that vehicle is inoperable. Any one of the following conditions shall raise the presumption that a vehicle is inoperable:

(1)   Absence of an effective registration plate upon such vehicle;

(2)   Placement of the vehicle, or parts thereof, upon jacks, blocks, chains or other supports;

(3)   Absence of one or more parts of the vehicle necessary for the lawful operation of the vehicle upon the streets and highways.

(e)   Nuisance and abatement. Any inoperable vehicle parked, stored or deposited in a manner other than that permitted under this section is hereby declared a nuisance and may be abated under the same authority and procedure for the abatement of nuisances as set forth in section 13-1 as it now exists or may be amended.

(f)    Penalty.

(1)   Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $25.00 or more than $500.00, or imprisoned not to exceed five days, or be both so fined and imprisoned, for each offense.

a. Applicant shall present satisfactory proof that the proposed location and use is
reasonably necessary.
b. None of the above uses shall be required to comply fully with the lot size and height
regulations of the zoning district in which they are located except as may be required

Documentation of this requirement shall be placed in the record by affidavit of
applicant or intended user of the tower, who shall also submit a tower propagation
map for a geographic area determined by the Zoning Administrator. At the request of
the Planning Commission additional evidence in the form of testimony may be

the end of the term of the approved permit the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing on the renewal of the permit, unless at such time the permit holder
advises the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that a renewal of the permit is not
desired. At such hearing the Planning Commission will make findings as to: (1) the
permit holder's compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit; (2) requests
that have been accepted and rejected by the permit holder for co-location on the
subject tower; and (3) whether any change in circumstance or condition relative to
the tower and/or the surrounding neighborhood requires reconsideration of any of the
factors for consideration set out at 12-801 of these regulations.
SECTION 12-2 FENCING AND SCREENING
12-201. Security fences must be constructed around or upon parcels containing towers and similar
structures. Screening is not required of towers.

tower or similar structures.
SECTION 12-5 ACCESS

kept and maintained in good condition, order, and repair so as not to menace or
endanger public health or safety.
12-4
SECTION 12-7 DESIGN
12-701. All permittees shall make every reasonable effort to design and construct new towers and
similar structures to blend into the character and environment of the area in which they are located,
including the use of camouflage techniques and side mounting antennas.
SECTION 12-8 CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
12-801.
a. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided a Conditional Use Permit application for a
telecommunication tower shall be subject to the same procedures for consideration
and action as applies to any other Conditional Use Permit application pursuant to
Article 26 of these regulations.
b. In lieu of the factors for consideration of a Conditional Use Permit application under
26-109 of these regulations, the Planning Commission may recommend approval of a
Conditional Use Permit, and the Governing Body may approve such permit for a
telecommunications tower, using the following factors as guidelines:
1. Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the intent
and purpose of, and meets the requirements of, these regulations;
2. The aesthetic impact of the proposed telecommunications tower on the
surrounding neighborhood;
3. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety and general welfare
outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not granting the
permit;
4. Whether the positions of the applicant and/or the opponents are substantiated
by substantial competent evidence or rather generalized concerns or
unsubstantiated claims are made to the Planning Commission and/or
Governing Body;
5. Whether an F.C.C. license has been granted to the applicant authorizing
provision of wireless services to the community and whether radio frequency
emissions will comply with F.C.C. regulations;
12-5
6. Whether there is an existing tower upon which the applicant can co-locate
and if so, what substantiated efforts have been made by applicant for colocation
and upon what basis were any such towers deemed unacceptable by
the applicant;
7. Will the tower adversely impact adjoining property values, present a hazard
to air space, negatively impact the environment, traffic or in any other manner
create negative impacts upon the neighborhood or community;
8. The recommendation of professional planning staff;
9. The expert testimony presented on behalf of and in opposition to the
application; and
10. Such other factors as may be relevant to the facts and evidence presented in
the application.
c. Consideration of an application for a Conditional Use Permit for a
telecommunications tower shall be considered and acted upon by the Planning
Commission and Governing Body in adherence to the limitations upon local
authorities set out in the National Wireless Telecommunications Siting Policy,
Section 332(c), 47 U.S.C. 332(c) which provides in part that the regulation of the
placement, construction and modification of personal wireless service facilities by a
local government shall not unreasonably discriminate among providers of
functionally equivalent services; and shall not prohibit nor have the effect of
prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. Further, the siting policy
provides that a local government shall act on any request for authorization to place,
construct or modify personal wireless service facilities within a reasonable period of
time after the request is duly filed, taking into account the nature and scope of such
request. Further that any decision by a local government to deny a request to place,
construct or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. And further that no
local government may regulate the placement, construction and modification of
personal wireless service facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio
frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the F.C.C.'s
regulations concerning such emissions.
SECTION 12-9 FILING REQUIREMENT
12-901. A permittee shall certify in writing that its tower is structurally sound and conforms to the
requirements of the applicable state law and all other construction standards set forth by the local,
federal and state law every three years by filing, by January 1st of every fifth year following the
12-6
date of the grant of its tower permit, a sworn statement by the permittee to that effect. All permittees
or owners of towers in existence on the effective date of these regulations shall submit a statement
by March 1, 2001, and by January 1st every five years thereafter that said tower is free from hazards
and that the tower does not pose an imminent threat to the surrounding area or public health and
safety. Together with this statement every permittee shall provide a certificate of liability insurance
for not less than $500,000.00 coverage for injury to persons or property as a result of any tower
failure or malfunction or defect. Permittee shall list the Zoning Administrator as a party who must
be notified should this insurance be canceled or discontinued for any reason, thirty (30) days before
the expiration of coverage.
SECTION 12-10 REVOCATION OF PERMIT
12-1001. The Governing Body may at any time revoke a permit for failure to comply with the
provisions of these regulations. To properly revoke a permit, the Governing Body must comply with

SECTION 16-1 INTENT
16-101. It is the intent of the Planned Unit Development Overlay District to encourage innovation in
residential, commercial and industrial development by greater variety in type, design and layout of
buildings, to encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of land
development; to encourage the expansion of urban areas incorporating the best features of modern
design while conserving the value of the land; and to provide a procedure which relates the type,
design and layout of development to the particular site and the particular demand at the time of
development in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values within established
neighborhoods.
The PUD District is an overlay zone. The developer shall submit preliminary and final development
plans in accordance with the provisions and conditions set out in this Article.
SECTION 16-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
16-201. A planned unit development shall be in general conformity with the provisions of the
City’s Comprehensive Plan, and shall not have a substantially adverse effect on the development of
the neighboring area. The plan shall consist of a preliminary plan for development of the entire tract
and for a final plan of development for individual portions of the plan.
a. Permitted uses. The applicant may propose any mixture of land uses including
residential, commercial, and/or industrial uses.
b. Size. The minimum size allowed for a planned unit development shall be two (2)
acres.
c. Bulk regulations including front, rear and side yard setbacks, and structure
height. Generally consistent with the existing zoning district on the proposed site,
but may be varied for a specific site as proposed by the developer when so approved.
16-2
d. Parking. Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided for all uses within
the district in accordance with the requirements of these regulations, unless it is
determined by the Planning Commission and the Governing Body that other parking
ratios are more appropriate for a specific proposal.
SECTION 16-3 SPECIFIC STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS
16-301.
a. The applicant shall satisfy the Planning Commission that he or she has the ability to
carry out the proposed plan and shall prepare and submit a schedule of construction.
The proposed construction shall begin within a period of eighteen (18) months
following approval of a final plan by the Governing Body. The time period
established for the commencing of the plan may be modified from time to time by the
Planning Commission upon the showing of good cause by the developer. In the
event the landowner shall fail to commence the planned unit development within
eighteen (18) months after final approval has been granted by the Governing Body,
such approval shall terminate and shall be deemed null and void unless such time
period is extended by the Planning Commission upon written application by the
landowners.
b. The site shall be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic
that will be generated by the proposed development. The streets and driveways on
the site of the development shall be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of
the proposed development. Streets may be either public or private streets, however
all private streets shall be of a size that will carry anticipated traffic and shall be
paved. If it is determined that traffic control signals are required to prevent traffic
hazards or congestion upon adjacent streets, the control signals shall be provided at
the developer's expense.
c. The development shall not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities.
d. The application for a planned unit development shall be signed by all owners of the
land at the time of application. The plan may have areas designated for sale after
platting or development.
e. The location and arrangement of structures, parking areas, walks, lighting, and
facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a
planned unit development not used for structures, parking, loading areas, or access
ways shall be landscaped or otherwise improved.
16-3
f. When a commercial or industrial planned unit development or a commercial or
industrial use within a mixed use development abuts a residential district, either
adjacent to or within the planned development, a solid or semi-solid fence or wall
from six (6) to eight (8) feet in height and having a visual density of not less than
ninety percent (90%) per square foot shall be erected. Such fence or wall shall be on
or within three (3) feet of the property line separating the use from the residential
zone. Screen plantings may be used provided the type, size and number are shown
on the final development plan and are approved by the Planning Commission. All
required screening and plantings shall be maintained.
g. Setbacks shall be as required in the base zone in which the planned unit development
is located unless otherwise specifically approved by the Planning Commission and
Governing Body.
h. The planned unit development shall include such provisions for the ownership and
maintenance of the common open spaces and private streets as are reasonably
necessary to insure its continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to insure
that remedial measures will be available to the Governing Body if such is allowed to
deteriorate, or is not maintained in a condition consistent with the best interest of the
planned development or of the entire community.
i. No residential use shall have vehicular access onto an arterial street.
j. Sidewalks shall be provided for on all private streets in accordance with the size,
construction and location or sidewalks on public streets. An alternative pedestrian
and sidewalk plan may be developed which provides pedestrians access between each
use in the planned unit development, and consideration shall be given to providing
for bicycle traffic along arterial and collector streets and along the approved
pedestrian sidewalk system.
SECTION 16-4 APPLICATION PROCESS

SECTION 19-1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, AND
PURPOSES
a. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
1. The following floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved
in draft form by the Chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the
Kansas Department of Agriculture on April 21, 2014.
2. The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-741 et seq, and
specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health,
safety, and general welfare.
3. After notice and public hearing as provided by Article 26 of the Zoning
Regulations of the City of Concordia, the Concordia Planning Commission has
recommended that the Zoning Regulations be amended as set forth herein.
b. FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard
areas of the City of Concordia, Kansas are subject to inundation which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
relief, and impairment of the tax base; all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
2. General Causes of the Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by (1) the
cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases
in flood heights and velocities; and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by
uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
19-2
c. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 19-1, Subsection b(1); to
establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) 59.22(a)(3); and to meet the requirements of 44 CFR 60.3(b) and K.A.R. 5-
44-4 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in
times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such
uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction; and
3. Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended
development purposes due to the flood hazard.

forth in Section 19-4, Subsection a (2), the following provisions are required:
a. Residential Construction
New construction or substantial-improvement of any residential structure,
including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
19-8
elevated to a minimum of one (1) foot above base flood level. The elevation of the
lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or professional
engineer.
b. Non-Residential Construction
New construction or substantial-improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
other non-residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated a minimum of one (1) foot above the
base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
dry floodproofed to a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
subsection are satisfied. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a
licensed land surveyor or professional engineer. Such certification shall be
provided to the floodplain administrator as set forth in Section 19-3, Subsection c
(7) (8) (9).
c. Require for all new construction and substantial-improvements, that fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
(1) A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than
one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided; and
(2) The bottom of all opening shall be no higher than one (1) foot above
grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and

2. In all areas of special flood hazard, once floodway data is obtained, as set forth in
Section 19-4, Subsection a (2), the following provisions are required:
a. The designated floodway shall be based on the standard that the area chosen for
the floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without
increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot at any point; and
b. The community shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial-improvements, and other development within the
designated regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
19-9
increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
c. MANUFACTURED HOMES
1. All manufactured homes to be placed within special flood hazard areas shall be
required to be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. For the
purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are
not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
2. Require manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within
unnumbered A zones on the community's FIRM or FHBM on sites:
a. Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
b. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;

d. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred “substantial-damage” as the result of a flood, be
elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home is elevated to a minimum of one (1) foot above the base flood level and be
securely attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified
by a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.
3. Require that manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision within unnumbered A zones on the
community's FIRM or FHBM, that are not subject to the provisions of Section 19-4,
Subsection c(2) of this ordinance, be elevated so that either:
a. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of one (1) foot above
the base flood level; or
b. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six
(36) inches in height above grade and be securely attached to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer.
19-10
d. RECREATIONAL VEHICLES
Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within unnumbered A zones on the
community's FIRM or FHBM either:
1. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
2. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use*; or
3. Meet the permitting, elevating, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured
homes of this ordinance.
*A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is

designation and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
3. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in
flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
19-12
4. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
5. Variances shall only be issued upon: (a) showing of good and sufficient cause,
(b) determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant, and (c) determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
6. A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a
community official that: (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base
flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (b) such construction below the
base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained
with the record of all variance actions as required by this ordinance.

violation, all permitted special uses shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and
shall be illegal, non-conforming uses and shall be summarily removed and abated.
j. If the temporary structure is to be returned to its previously occupied site, the process
for issuing a special use permit must be repeated in full. Any subsequent permit shall be
valid for 180 days only.

SECTION 20-9 FENCES
20-901. Except as otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in these regulations or other codes and
regulations of the City the following restrictions shall apply to the construction of all fences or
improvements, replacements or extensions of existing fences.
a. No fence shall be constructed without first obtaining a fence permit from the Zoning
Administrator. The fee for a fence permit shall be an amount established by the City
Commission by ordinance.
20-8
b. No fence shall be constructed closer to the street than the front setback line
established for the district in which such fence is to be erected; provided however,
that a fence not exceeding four (4) feet in height may be constructed within a required
front yard setback if the Zoning Administrator determines that such a fence otherwise
complies with the regulations of this section.
c. No fence shall be constructed in the sight triangle area or that would constitute a

must be manufactured to the standards embodied in the National Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards generally know as the HUD Code
established in 1976 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 5403. Such structures shall provide
all of the accommodations necessary to be a dwelling unit and shall be connected to
all utilities in conformance with applicable City regulations. Such a structure shall be
on a permanent-type, enclosed perimeter foundation which has minimum dimensions
of 22 body feet in width excluding bay windows, garages, porches, patios, pop-outs
and roof overhangs; a pitched roof; siding and roofing materials which are
customarily used on site-built homes; and which complies with the following
architectural or aesthetic standards so as to ensure their compatibility with site-built
housing:
1. The roof must be predominantly double-pitched and have a minimum vertical
rise of 2.5 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal run, and must be covered
with material that is customarily used on site-built dwellings, including but
not limited to approved wood, asphalt composition shingles, clay or concrete

material shall extend below the top of the exterior of the foundation or curtain
wall or the joint between siding and enclosure wall shall be flashed in
accordance with City-adopted building codes.
3. The home shall be installed in accordance with the recommended installation
procedure of the manufacturer and the Uniform Building Code as adopted by
the City.
4. The running gear, tongue, axles and wheels shall be removed from the unit at
the time of installation. Either a basement or a continuous, permanent
masonry foundation or curtain wall, unpierced except for required ventilation
and access which may include walk-out basements and garages, shall be
installed under the perimeter of the home.
5. At the main entrance door there shall be a landing that is a minimum of 25
square feet which is constructed to meet the requirements of City-adopted
20-10
building codes.
6. On level sites, the main floor shall be no greater than twenty four (24) inches
above the finished grade at the foundation. On sloping or irregular sites, the
main floor at the side closest to grade level shall not be greater than twentyfour
(24) inches above the finished grade at the foundation.

8. Any attached addition to such a home shall comply with all construction
requirements of the City-adopted building codes, unless designed and
constructed by a manufactured home factory.
9. If 50% or more of the frontage of existing site-built housing on both sides of
the street on which the residential-design manufactured home is to be
installed have a garage and/or a similar percentage have a covered porch or
recessed entry, such a home shall also provide a garage and/or porch or entry
based on the percentages determined by the Zoning Administrator. On a
corner lot, “street” shall mean that street on which the frontage of the facade
has been designated for the household address number. External roofing and
siding material of such garage, porch or entry shall be similar in appearance
to the materials on the roofing and siding of the residential-design
manufactured home.
b. For purposes of these regulations, the term "manufactured home", when used by itself,
shall not include a "residential-design manufactured home" as herein defined.

NONCONFORMITIES
Sections:
21-1 General Provisions
21-2 Nonconforming Lots of Record
21-3 Nonconforming Structures
21-4 Nonconforming Uses
21-5 Nonconforming Manufactured Homes
SECTION 21-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
21-101. Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming structures
and nonconforming uses. Special regulations governing nonconforming manufactured homes are set
forth at Section 21-5. Each type of nonconformity is defined as follows:
a. Nonconforming lots of record: Means an unimproved lot which is part of a
recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was recorded with the
Cloud County Register of Deeds prior to the original adoption of zoning regulations
(Ord. No. 1829, effective date January 20, 1972) and neither said lot nor parcel
complies with the lot width or area requirements for any permitted use in the district
in which it is located.
b. Nonconforming structure: Means an existing structure which does not comply with
the lot coverage, height or yard requirements which are applicable to new structures
in the zoning district in which it is located.
c. Nonconforming use: Means an existing, lawful use of a structure or land which
does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district
in which it is located.
SECTION 21-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD
21-201. The Zoning Administrator may issue a zoning certificate for any nonconforming lot of
record, provided that:
a. Said lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and
individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such
size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning
regulations, and
21-2
b. Said lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of
land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been
prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations, and
c. Said lot can meet all yard regulations for the district in which it is located.
SECTION 21-3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
21-301.
a. Authority to continue. Any structure that is devoted to a use which is permitted in
the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not
comply with the applicable intensity of use regulations and/or the applicable yard and
height regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
b. Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming principal structure may be
enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled. No such enlargement, maintenance,
repair or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the
degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. Provided,
however, an enlargement which does not extend the nonconformity beyond the
existing nonconformity shall not be an additional nonconformity or an increase in the
degree of nonconformity.
c. Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming principal structure is
damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of
its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. When a
principal structure is damaged to the extent of fifty (50) percent or less of its fair
market value, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a zoning certificate is
obtained and substantial restoration is underway within one year after the date of such
partial destruction and repair or restoration is diligently pursued to completion.
d. Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any
distance whatever, to any other location on the same lot or any other lot unless the
entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located after being moved.
21-3
SECTION 21-4 NONCONFORMING USES
21-401.
a. Authority to continue. Any nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any
lawfully existing nonconforming use of land which was lawful and in existence at the
effective date of these regulations and does not involve a structure or only involves a
structure which is accessory to such use of land, may be continued, so long as
otherwise lawful and so long as it is not specified to be terminated by these
regulations.
b. Ordinary repair and maintenance.
1. Normal maintenance and incidental repair, or replacement, installation or
relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in
part to a nonconforming use.
2. Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a
public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who
declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe
condition.
c. Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or
increased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include, without being limited
to the following:
1. Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that actually
physically occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these
regulations or on the effective date of subsequent amendments to these
regulations that cause such use to become nonconforming.
2. Extension of such use within a building or other structure to any portion of
the floor area that was not actually physically occupied by such
nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the
effective date of subsequent amendments to these regulations that cause such
use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such use may be
extended throughout any part of such building or other structure that is found
by the Zoning Administrator to have been lawfully and manifestly designed
or constructed for such use on such effective date.
21-4
d. Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming
use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
e. Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in
part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of
more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be
restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. When such damage or
destruction is fifty (50) percent or less of fair market value, no repairs or restoration
shall be made unless a zoning certificate is obtained, and substantial restoration is
underway within one year after the date of such partial destruction and repair or
restoration is diligently pursued to completion.
f. Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and
no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance
whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire
structure and the use thereof or the use of land shall thereafter conform to all
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.
g. Change in use. Unless structural alterations are made which will expand the area or
change the dimensions of the existing structure, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or nonconforming structure and premises, may change to another
nonconforming use provided that the Board of Zoning Appeals either by general rule
or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed
nonconforming use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards to protect surrounding
areas and the public welfare, in accordance with Article 25. Once such use has
changed, it may no longer be returned to the original use or any other less appropriate
use.
h. Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, such use shall not
thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such
land or buildings shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which
such land is located.
i. Nonconforming accessory uses. No nonconforming use which is accessory to a
principal nonconforming use shall continue after such principal use shall cease or
terminate.
21-5
SECTION 21-5 NONCONFORMING MANUFACTURED HOMES
21-501. The removal and relocation of manufactured homes, other than residential-design
manufactured homes, in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Districts shall be governed by the following
regulations:
a. Upon removal of a nonconforming manufactured home, unless another manufactured
home is moved onto the same lot within sixty (60) days from the date that the
previous manufactured home was moved off the lot, such use is forfeited and shall
not thereafter be reestablished.
b. Any manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be placed on a
permanent, enclosed perimeter foundation within thirty (30) days from the date it is
moved onto the lot.
c. No manufactured home shall be moved onto the lot if such will result in an increase
in nonconformity with respect to lot size, yard or bulk requirements.
d. No manufactured home shall be moved onto the lot if its location shall place it within
twenty feet (20') of a principal building or ten feet (10') of an accessory building.
e. Upon proper application the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an exception to the
time requirements of subsections a. and b. above upon a finding by the Board of
hardship for the party who would reside in the manufactured home upon its
relocation.

22-5 Required Parking Spaces
22-6 Exceptions by Board of Zoning Appeals
22-7 Design Standards
SECTION 22-1 PURPOSE
22-101. These regulations require off-street parking proportional to the need created by each use in
order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities.
Regulations and standards are intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to
protect public safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.
SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS
22-201. Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this Article, shall be provided for
any new building and for any new use established, additions to existing use, or any change in manner
of use which results in increased capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the
addition, enlargement, or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities
shall be required in the C-4 Central Business District.
22-202. Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be maintained and shall not
be reduced so long as the use requiring such parking remains.
22-203. Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same site as the
use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall
be used exclusively for temporary parking of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or
storage of merchandise, or for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment or trailers.
22-204. Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more than three (3)
vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the district.
22-2
22-205. Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking spaces required
results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as a full space
and a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded. Where requirements are established on the
basis of seats or person capacity, the Uniform Building Code provisions applicable at the time shall
be used to calculate maximum design capacity.
22-206. Compact cars. In every off-street parking facility of ten (10) or more spaces, a maximum
of ten (10) percent of the required number of spaces may be designed for compact cars. For the
purpose of this section, a compact car is a motor vehicle with an overall length which does not
exceed fourteen (14) feet.
22-207. Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve minor
variations from the size and number of parking spaces otherwise required under this Article when, in
his or her discretion, such variation does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not
harm public health, safety or welfare.
SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
22-301. Area size. Each required parking space shall consist of a rectangular area of not less than
nine (9) feet in width, by nineteen (19) feet in length. Each space for compact cars, when allowed by
this Article shall consist of a rectangular area of not less than eight (8) feet in width, by seventeen
(17) feet in length. All required spaces shall be clearly marked and defined.
22-302. Access. Except in R-1 and R-2 districts, each required off-street parking space shall open
directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of
vehicular access to such parking space. Streets and alleys shall be used only for access to and from
parking facilities and shall not be used for maneuvering of vehicles. Any alley used for access to
other than a single-family residence shall be paved according to City-adopted specifications.
22-303. Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall comply with Section
22-7.
22-304. Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with the Corridor Management
Policy Manual of the Kansas Department of Transportation. Site plans for commercial properties
shall include a traffic impact analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of
shared entrances.
22-305. Surfacing. (a) All off-street parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular storage areas and
drives and access to and from such areas shall be surfaced and maintained with four (4) inches of
asphalt, or concrete to create a permanent all-weather, dust-free surface. Such paving must be
completed prior to occupancy of the facility that the paving is intended to serve, unless temporary
occupancy approval is received from the site plan review committee.
22-3
(b) Gravel areas in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations may be maintained
with six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these surfacing
requirements.
(c) The site plan review committee may, upon receiving a specific written request from an owner
of a property, authorize temporary occupancy for a time period not to exceed twelve (12)
months prior to accomplishing the required paving or a portion thereof.
(d) In reviewing a request for temporary occupancy prior to accomplishing required paving, the
site plan review committee shall consider the following criteria:
(1) Season of the year.
(2) Affect on the adjoining property.
(3) Surfacing of the connecting street.
(4) Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.
(e) Should the owner receive approval of the site plan review committee for a delay in paving,
the owner shall, prior to occupancy, present written verification to the Zoning Administrator
that guarantees all paving shall be complete prior to the deadline given by the site plan
review committee.
(f) Parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular storage areas and drives and access to and from
such areas in industrial-zoned districts may also utilize pavers or grids, and portions of such
areas may remain unimproved until such time as the Planning Commission deems it must be
improved. Such delayed improvement shall be permitted only following a determination by
the Planning Commission that usage of the improved portion adequately serves the initial
occupancy of the property and that the site plan clearly indicates the location, pattern and
circulation to and from the delayed parking, loading and storage areas.
22-306. Lighting. Any lighting provided to illuminate any parking facility shall be designed and
installed in such a manner as to reflect away from any residential use upon adjoining properties.
22-307. Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with storm drainage
facilities so as to channel surface water away from adjoining properties and to an approved storm
drainage system.
22-308. Parking facilities in residential districts. Any parking facilities for eight (8) or more
vehicles (1) when in residential zoning districts and (2) which are adjacent to a residential or mobile
home-zoned district, shall have a screened fence or wall to prevent the passage of vehicular lights
and to prevent the blowing of debris. Such fence or wall shall be at least six (6) feet in height and
have a visual density of not less than seventy percent (70%).

areas in any zoning district under the following provisions:
a. Location. Parking provided under this section must be within three hundred (300)
feet (along lines of public access) from the boundary of the use for which the parking
is provided. Access to such parking facilities from the use must be adequately
lighted to provide for safety of the public.
b. Use. The parking area shall be used for passenger vehicles only, and in no case shall
it be used for sales, repair work, storage, dismantling or servicing of vehicles,
equipment, materials or supplies. Only such signs as are necessary for the proper
operation of the parking lot shall be permitted.
c. Improvements. Parking areas and driveways on private property providing ingress
and egress to parking areas shall be surfaced with concrete or asphalt to the
specifications of the City Engineer and shall be maintained in good condition and
free of all weeds, dust, trash, and other debris.
22-7
d. Guards. Parking areas shall have adequate guards to prevent extension or the
overhanging of vehicles beyond property lines or parking spaces; and parking areas
shall have adequate markings for channelization and movement of vehicles.
e. Screening. A fence (such as solid-wall masonry, wood, louvered wood, metal or
other similar materials) at least six (6) feet high and having a density of not less than
seventy (70) percent per square feet, shall be erected along any property line adjacent
to or adjoining any dwelling district to eliminate the passage of light from vehicles

continued.
26-104. Action by Planning Commission and Governing Body.
a. Recommendations. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall prepare and adopt its recommendations and shall submit the same,
together with a record of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. The
recommendation may be for approval, disapproval or approval in part and reasons for
the recommendations shall be included. If a motion for approval fails to gain
approval for any reason, the application is deemed to have been denied and will be
submitted to the Governing Body. If the recommendation is for approval, the
recommendation shall be in the form of an ordinance.
b. Amendments to text. When a proposed amendment would result in a change in the
text of these regulations but would not result in a change of zoning classification of
any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall contain
a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and its reasons
for recommending approval or denial.
c. Adoption of amendments. The Governing Body shall not consider an amendment

application for a Conditional Use Permit, until its next regular meeting after the lapse
of the fourteen (14) day protest period provided by state law. A proposed amendment
which changes the text of the regulations but would not result in change of zoning
classification of any specific property may be considered by the Governing Body
without waiting for the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period. Upon receipt of
the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any protest petitions that have
been submitted, the Governing Body shall consider the application and may 1)
approve the recommendation of the Planning Commission without change; 2)
override the Planning Commissions recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the
membership of the Governing Body; or 3) return such recommendation to the
Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing
Bodys failure to approve or disapprove. Upon return of a recommendation from the
26-4
Planning Commission, the Governing Body may take whatever action it deems
necessary. Whenever a proposed amendment is defeated by vote of the Governing
Body, such amendment shall not thereafter be passed without a further public hearing
and notice thereof as provided in this article.
d. If such amendment or Conditional Use Permit affects the boundaries of any zone or
district, the ordinance shall describe the boundaries as amended, or if provision is
made for the fixing of the same upon the official maps which as been incorporated by
reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or the boundary as
amended, shall order the official maps be changed to reflect such amendment or
conditional use, shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and
shall reincorporate such maps as amended.
26-105. Protest Petition. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or
disapproves a proposed zoning amendment, revision, change, or Conditional Use Permit, if a protest
petition against such amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days
after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the
owners of twenty (20) percent or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners
of record of twenty (20) percent or more of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, which is
located within the notification area described in 26-102, the ordinance adopting such amendment
shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 majority vote of all the members of the Governing Body.
Immediately upon receiving the filing of such a protest petition the City Clerk shall notify the Zoning
Administrator of such petition.
26-106. Limitations on Successive Applications. Provisions for a limitation on successive
applications to the Planning Commission shall be as follows:
a. No application for an amendment to these regulations including the zoning map shall
be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for the same amendment
has been denied by the Planning Commission within the preceding twelve (12)
months. The withdrawal of an application after it has been advertised for public
hearing shall constitute a denial of the application just as if the public hearing had
been held and concluded. For good cause shown by the applicant the Governing
Body may waive the twelve (12) month requirements.
b. Irrespective of the preceding subsection, an application for a rehearing may be
accepted by the Planning Commission if in the judgment of the Planning Commission

26-107. Posting of Sign. An applicant for a rezoning or for a Conditional Use Permit may be
required by the Zoning Administrator to place a sign upon the lot, tract or parcel of land for which
the application was filed. Said sign shall be furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant
and the applicant shall display the sign as instructed by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply
with this requirement shall not deprive the Planning Commission of its jurisdiction or affect any
decision but may be due cause for the Planning Commission to refuse to hear the application or to
adjourn the hearing or to require further notice.
26-108. Factors to be Considered in a Rezoning. When a proposed amendment would result in
a change of the zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, accompanied by a copy of the record of the hearing, shall contain statements as to the
present classification, the classification under the proposed amendment, the reasons for seeking such
reclassification, a summary of the facts presented, and a statement of the factors upon which the
recommendation of the Planning Commission is based, using the following guidelines:
a. Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent and purpose
of these regulations;
b. The character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its effect on the
proposed change;
c. Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing
conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing
conditions;
d. The current zoning and uses of nearby properties, and the effect on existing nearby
land uses upon such a change in classification;
e. Whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified would be
compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity;
f. The suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has been restricted;
g. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as
zoned;
h. Whether adequate sewer and water facilities, and all other needed public services
exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the property if it
were reclassified;
i. The general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning classification
proposed for the subject property, particularly in the vicinity of the subject property,
and any special circumstances that make a substantial part of such vacant land
26-6
available or not available for development;
j. The recommendations of professional staff;
k. Whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and further enhance
the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
l. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety , and general welfare outweighs
the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not upgrading the value of the property
by such reclassification; and,
m. Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from the facts and
evidence presented in the application.
26-109. Factors to be Considered in an Application for a Conditional Use Permit.
a. Because of particular conditions associated with their activities, certain uses which
might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future
development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as
conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional
requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding
property, the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction.
b. In approving a conditional use, the minimum requirements set out in these
regulations for the underlying district must be met unless otherwise reduced by
specific reference in the approval of the Governing Body. The requirements may be
made more stringent if there are potentially injurious effects which may be
anticipated upon other property or the neighborhood or which may be contrary to
public health, safety or welfare.
c. The Planning Commission may recommend approval of a conditional use that is
expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district, and the Governing
Body may approve such conditional use, using the following factors as guidelines:
1. Whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the intent
and purpose of these regulations;
2. Whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses in
the surrounding neighborhood;
3. Whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing
transportation and service facilities in the area affected and, if so, whether
such additional transportation and service facilities can be provided;
26-7
4. Whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because of changed
or changing conditions in the area affected;
5. The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped
as zoned;
6. Whether the applicant’s property is suitable for the proposed conditional use;
7. The recommendations of professional staff;
8. Whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to and further
enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan;
9. Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety, and general welfare
outweighs the hardship imposed on the applicant by not upgrading the value
of the property by approving the proposed conditional use;
10. Whether the proposed conditional use, if it complies with all the conditions
upon which the approval is made contingent, will not adversely affect the
property in the area affected;
11. For uses as solid waste disposal facilities, including sanitary landfills,
construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations, whether the
proposed conditional use is consistent with the adopted Solid Waste
Management Plan of Cloud County, and amendments thereto; and
12. Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from the
facts and evidence presented in the application.
26-110. Traffic Studies. In the case of an application for rezoning of land or for a Conditional Use
Permit for a use which may, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, substantially change traffic
patterns, or create traffic congestion, the Planning Commission may require that the applicant
procure the services of a competent professional traffic engineer for the purpose of preparing a traffic
study to be presented to the Planning Commission prior to its taking action on an application for
rezoning or for a Conditional Use Permit. Such traffic study shall show that the traffic generated by
the proposed development will be handled on the site in an orderly and efficient manner, that
vehicular ingress and egress from the site onto public streets will function in an orderly and efficient
manner and that no undue burden will be placed upon the existing public street system. The results
of the traffic study shall be used in determining the impact of the proposed rezoning or Conditional
Use Permit and guide the development of a recommendation or decision regarding the same.
26-111. Platting. Approval of any rezoning may be conditioned upon approval of final platting of
some or all the property to be rezoned.
26-8
SECTION 26-2 CONDITIONAL ZONING
26-201. The Planning Commission, subject to final approval by the Governing Body, or the
Governing Body at its own initiative, in the process of rezoning land may limit the uses which are
permitted in the district to which land is to be rezoned. Such a limitation shall be finally approved
by the Governing Body only upon a finding that such limitation upon permitted uses is necessary to
protect public health, safety or general welfare and is consistent with the purposes of these
regulations.
SECTION 26-3 TABLE OF LESSER CHANGE
26-301. The following Table of Lesser Change is for the use of the Planning Commission in
determining when republication of an application for rezoning is required. This Table of Lesser
Change designates which zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the published
zoning classifications. The Table of Lesser Change lists zoning classifications in descending order
from the most restrictive zoning district to the least restrictive zoning district. The Planning
Commission may modify, at its discretion, an application for rezoning to a particular district by
recommending a rezoning to a district of lesser change, as determined by the following Table of
Lesser Change:
R-1 Low Density Residential District
R-2 Medium Density Residential District

SECTION 26-4 TIME OF PERFORMANCE IN REZONING
26-401.
a. In cases where the Planning Commission and Governing Body deem that time of
development is a critical factor in protecting the public welfare in a rezoning action, a
time of performance may be included in the rezoning ordinance. Such time allowed
for performance shall be reasonable. Such time shall be not less than five years from
the effective date of the ordinance for all rezonings into districts in which singlefamily
dwellings are allowed and not less than two years from the effective date of
the resolution for all rezonings into districts in which single-family dwellings are not
allowed. Such ordinance shall state what constitutes performance in each case.
b. If at the termination of such stipulated period of time performance as required has not
occurred, the Planning Commission may, within six (6) months thereafter, publish
notice and conduct a public hearing for purposes of determining whether or not to
change the zoning to a more restrictive district. The owner of the property in question
shall be notified by certified mail of the proposed hearing not less than 20 days prior
to the date of the hearing. Other notification and posting as required in this section
shall be performed and all proceedings shall be the same as for other rezoning actions.
c. It shall be the purpose of this hearing to hear the owner and other interested parties
and make a determination as to which of the following actions would be
recommended to the Governing Body.
1. Extend the time of performance to a specified date,
2. Remove the time of performance, or
3. Rezone the land.

the manner outlined in this Article.
26-504. The Planning Commission may revoke any Conditional Use Permit upon finding that (a)
necessary building permits have not been issued within twelve (12) months of approval of the
Conditional Use Permit or (b) if no building permit is required for the use allowed under the
Conditional Use Permit, that the use so allowed has not been commenced within twelve (12) months
of the approval of the Conditional Use Permit. No revocation shall occur once a valid building
permit has been issued or conditional use commenced, regardless of the running of such twelve (12)
month period.
26-505. In all instances where a use was allowed under a valid Conditional Use Permit properly
issued prior to the effective date of these regulations, which such use would have been a
nonconforming use under these regulations but for the issuance of such permit, the property owner
shall continue to comply with the conditions set forth in that permit until the permit expires or is
otherwise terminated in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.
SECTION 26-6 FEES FOR REZONINGS AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS
26-601. A fee, in the amount established by ordinance adopted by the Governing Body, shall
accompany an application for rezoning or Conditional Use Permit which fee shall include the cost of

28-6 Standard of Review
SECTION 28-1 INTENT
28-101.
a. The very nature of land development creates potential for traffic congestion,
overcrowding, adverse visual environmental impacts, and health problems. Also, the
City strives to achieve the goal of promoting growth in Concordia, while stabilizing
the established residential patterns of the area. The City seeks to ensure that any
location that accommodates intense urban use be subject to Site Plan Review by the
Planning Commission in accordance with this Article. Site Plan Review helps ensure
that the meaning and intent of these zoning regulations are fully complied with.
b. Site Plan Review regulates the development of structures and sites in a manner that
considers the following concerns:
1. The balancing of landowners rights to use their land, with the corresponding
rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without undue
disturbances, including, for example, noise, smoke, fumes, dust, odor, glare
and storm water runoff;
2. The convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the
site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
3. The adequacy of waste disposal methods and protection from pollution of
surface or groundwater;
4. The protection of historic and natural environmental features of the site under
review, and those of adjacent areas; and

of a renovation or alteration. A site plan should be required upon the Zoning Administrator’s
determination that development may impact traffic, parking, stormwater runoff, or create
other impacts upon public health, safety or welfare. Developments shall be encouraged to
implement the objectives of the adopted City of Concordia Future Land Use Plan to foster
compatibility among land uses in the City. Site plan reviews shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for final approval.
b. Prior to application, a pre-application conference shall be held between the applicant and city
staff to discuss the site review requirement and other site or application issues specific to the
proposed development or redevelopment. The applicant should submit preliminary plans for
initial review and comment at this time. The pre-application conference is also an
opportunity for the applicant to have the site plan review process fully explained by city staff,
and for raising any questions as to the applicability of that process, or any other requirement
of these regulations, to the proposed development or redevelopment.
c. Following application submittal, site plan reviews shall be performed by city staff, including
but not limited to the Zoning Administrator, the Director of Streets, Utilities, Police Chief,

1-101. These regulations shall hereinafter be known and may be cited as the Subdivision
Regulations for the City of Concordia, Kansas and shall hereinafter be referred to as "these
regulations."
SECTION 1-2 PURPOSE
1-201. a. Subdivision Regulations are the process through which raw land is converted into
buildable sites for residential, commercial and industrial uses. The physical arrangement
of these lots along with provisions for streets, alleys, utilities, schools, parks and other
community facilities will in a large part determine the quality of life in the community
and, therefore, is of public interest. Such regulations establish standards that insure that
the growth of urban areas will reflect sound planning and will not be detrimental to the
community.
b. These regulations are designed, intended and adopted for the following purposes:
1. To protect and provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City of
Concordia.
2. To implement the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Concordia.
1-2
3. To provide for adequate light, air and privacy, to secure safety from fire, flood and
other danger, and to prevent overcrowding of the land.
4. To protect and conserve the value and desirability of land and neighborhoods
throughout the community.
5. To guide public and private policy and action in order to provide adequate and
efficient transportation, water, sewage, schools, parks, playgrounds, recreation and
other public requirements and facilities necessary to protect and promote public
health, safety and general welfare.
6. To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivisions and resubdivisions.
7. To insure proper legal descriptions, monumenting of land, and adequate and accurate
platting and records of land subdivision.
8. To harmoniously relate the development of the various tracts of land to the existing
community and facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts.
9. To insure that public facilities are available and will have a sufficient capacity to
serve the proposed subdivision.
10. To provide for and secure to the proper governmental agencies the actual
construction of all such necessary on-site and off-site public improvements including
the reservation or dedication of land for park and recreational purposes.
11. To reserve or dedicate land for open space to preserve natural areas for watercourses,
drainage ways, woodland, rugged topography, wildlife habitat, and for water quality
and quantity, and to protect land from soil erosion.
12. To coordinate the subdividing of land with applicable zoning regulations, and other
City regulations which affect the development of the land.
SECTION 1-3 AUTHORITY
1-301. These Subdivision Regulations and minimum standards for land development are adopted by
the Planning Commission and approved by the City Commission under powers conferred by K.S.A.
12-749 and Article 12, Section 5 of the Constitution of the State of Kansas.
1-3
SECTION 1-4 POLICY
1-401. a. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can be used safely for building
purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace nor
unnecessarily subjecting existing development to such danger or peril. It is further
intended that land shall not be subdivided until proper provision has been made for
drainage, water and sewage and other necessary infrastructure.
b. The existing and proposed public improvements shall conform to and be properly related
to the features of the adopted Concordia Comprehensive Plan, and all other adopted plans
for specific aspects of the City, and adopted capital programs and budgets.
SECTION 1-5 JURISDICTION
1-501. These regulations shall apply to all land located within the corporate limits of the City of

the use by prospective or existing owners of lots, tracts or parcels of land fronting on or
adjacent to such property.
The owner(s) of any land subject to these regulations subdividing said land in a manner
previously cited shall cause to be prepared a subdivision plat in accordance with the
provisions of these regulations. No building or zoning permit shall hereafter be issued for
construction on any land that has not been subdivided in compliance with these regulations
and all other applicable state laws and local laws in effect at the time of the subdivision of
said land.
1-4
SECTION 1-7 EXEMPTIONS
1-701. The following specific transactions shall be exempt from compliance with the provisions of
these regulations.

regulations and was not previously exempted under any previous subdivision regulations,
where no more than one (1) additional lot, tract or parcel is created, provided, however,
that the creation of said additional lot, tract or parcel shall comply with the provisions for

or parcel, including any remainder parcel or tract, shall be platted in conformance with
the requirements of these regulations.

restrictive standard shall apply.

regulations shall not become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of these

thereto, the following rules regarding the vesting of development rights shall apply:
a. The rights of landowners of properties platted or subdivided for residential development
shall be protected for use of said land for the intended residential purposes for a period of
five (5) years from the date upon which the plat for such property was first recorded with
the Cloud County Register of Deeds. Provided, the division of land was legally done in
conformance with the Concordia Subdivision Regulations in effect at the time of such
recording.
b. Except for lots in a recorded plat, any remaining contiguous tracts of land within the area
divided under this rule held in common ownership at the conclusion of said five (5) year
period shall be considered an unplatted lot, and subsequent divisions of such tracts shall
be in conformance with the subdivision regulations then in effect.
c. Properties divided or platted for any use other than residential purposes shall not be
permitted to develop or further develop except in conformance with these regulations and
the Concordia Zoning Regulations. Persons who obtain a validly issued permit under the
previous Concordia Zoning Regulations shall be permitted to develop the property so
long as the permit issued under the previous Concordia Zoning Regulations does not
expire. Failure to begin substantial construction under said permit before the expiration
of the permit shall not protect the owner from the provisions of these regulations or the
Concordia Zoning Regulations then in effect.
1-6
SECTION 1-10 APPROVALS NECESSARY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF SUBDIVISION
PLATS
1-1001. All subdivision plats or re-plats of land laid out in building lots, and the streets, alleys or

and other public ways or sites.
SECTION 1-11 ACCRUED RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES SAVED

or as waiving any right of the City under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of

variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be sixty (60)
degrees.
g. Streets Adjacent to a Railroad Right-of-Way, Limited Access Freeway, Principal
Highway or Arterial Streets. Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad rightsof-
way, limited access freeways, principal highways, or arterial streets a marginal access
street or frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such
4-4
rights-of-way. The distance from said rights-of-way shall be determined with due
consideration to minimum distance required for approach connections to future gradeseparated
intersections.

the center of the lot and perpendicular to the property line, or radial to the property
4-6
line or curved streets.
c. Maximum depth of residential lots shall not exceed two and one-half (2 1/2) times
the width of the lot.
d. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with City water and City sewer or a
community-type sewage treatment plant, approval of the plat shall be subject to the
minimum requirements set forth in these regulations and the zoning regulations of the
district in which the subdivision is located.
e. If the proposed subdivision is to be served with a public water supply, but not with
a public sanitary sewer system, the preliminary plat will be submitted on the basis of
the minimum of three (3) acre lots and will be subject to the approval of the County
Health Department, who shall make or cause to be made soil analysis and percolation
tests for each lot and make recommendations to the Planning Commission. The plat
lots will be so proportioned as to permit future re-platting consistent with good
subdivision design.
f. If the proposed subdivision is served with a public sanitary sewer system and not
with a public water supply, and the developer will use a private water supply, the
preliminary plat will be submitted on the basis of a minimum of one (1) acre lots,
subject to the approval of the County Health Department, and be so proportioned that
future platting will be consistent with good subdivision design.
g. If the proposed subdivision is not served with either an approved public water
supply or an approved public sanitary sewer system and the developer will be using a
private water supply with an approved private sewage disposal system, the subdivider
shall submit his or her preliminary plat on the basis of ten (10) acre lots, subject to
the approval of the County Health Department, which shall secure soil analysis and
percolation tests and submit a recommendation to the Planning Commission. The
lots will be so proportioned as to permit future re-platting consistent with good
subdivision design.
h. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum area requirements of the zoning
regulations with no lot in a residential district being less than fifty (50) feet in width

arrangement.
m. Every lot shall have frontage on a public street other than an alley.
n. The subdivision or re-subdivision of a tract or lot shall not be permitted where said
subdivision or re-subdivision places an existing permanent structure in violation of
the requirements of the zoning regulations or the minimum design standards of these
regulations.
o. Whenever the area is divided into lots containing one (1) or more acres and there
are indications that such lots will eventually be re-subdivided into smaller lots,
consideration must be given to the highway, street and lot arrangement of the original
subdivision so that additional minor streets can be opened which will permit a logical
arrangement of smaller lots. Easements providing for the future opening and
extension of such streets may, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, be made
a requirement of the plat.
p. Whenever possible, residential lots shall not face on arterial streets. The number
of lots facing on collector streets shall be kept to a minimum in each subdivision.
The street pattern shall be designed so that the side line of lots abut collector streets
wherever land shapes and topography permit.

service provider can demonstrate the need for a wider easement than required above
for a specific location, such may be required by the Governing Body and provided by
the developer. These easements shall provide for a continuous right-of-way at least
twenty (20) feet in width. An additional twelve (12) foot wide temporary
construction easement abutting each side of a utility easement shall be provided for
initial construction of water, sewer and other utility lines. Such temporary easement
shall be terminated by the City upon its determination that development of lots
4-8

or channel, then a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way shall be provided.
Such easement or right-of-way shall conform substantially to the lines of the natural
water course and shall be of such width or construction, or both, as may be necessary
to provide adequate stormwater drainage and for access for maintenance thereof.
Parallel streets or parkways may be required in connection therewith. The City
Engineer shall make a study and report his or her recommendation to the Planning
Commission as to the desired width of such easement. Such study and report shall be
based on the one hundred year flood depth (if known). Maintenance of stormwater
easements and drainage right-of-way shall be the responsibility of the owners of
property adjoining such easements or right-of-way.
SECTION 4-6 DESIGN TECHNIQUES
4-601. Subdivision Design: The design of the subdivision shall provide for efficient traffic flow,

SECTION 7-3 EXCEPTIONS FOR EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS
7-301.
a. Where the proposed subdivision is a re-subdivision or concerns an area presently having
any or all required improvements as previously set out, and where such improvements
meet the requirements of this Article and are in good condition as determined by the City
Engineer no further provision need be made by the subdividers to duplicate such
improvements. However, where such existing improvements do not meet said
requirements, the subdivider shall provide for the repair, correction, or replacement of
such improvements so that all final improvements will then meet said requirements.
b. Where the proposed subdivision is a re-subdivision or concerns an area presently abutting
or containing any existing public street of less than the minimum required right-of-way
width or roadway width, land shall be dedicated so as to provide a minimum street rightof-
way width established by these regulations and/or Planning Commission policy, and
the subdivider of such proposed subdivision shall provide an additional roadway
pavement meeting the minimum standards set by these regulations and the City Engineer.
The Engineer shall determine what adjustment to make where the aforesaid widenings
merge with existing streets which are of smaller width at the boundary of such proposed
subdivision. The Engineer may reduce the minimum roadway required by these
regulations to match an existing roadway system if the extension of such roadway is
already improved at each end of the roadway in the subdivision and the roadway in the
subdivision to be reduced is two (2) blocks or less in length. The Engineer may also
require lanes to be painted on such widened streets designating driving and parking areas.
The foregoing provisions requiring the widening of pavement may be waived by the
Planning Commission when the length of such pavement is less than one (1) block.
SECTION 7-4 WAIVERS
7-401. The Governing Body is authorized to grant a waiver of any of the improvements required in
this Article. Such waiver may be granted only upon a finding of the Governing Body: (1) that the
required improvement is technically not feasible, or (2) after consulting with the City Attorney, that
either the purpose of the improvement requirement is not sufficiently related to the development, or
that the estimated cost of the improvement is unfair to the applicant because it is disproportionate to
the impact expected to result from the development.

SECTION 9-1 GUARANTEE OF INSTALLATION
9-101. In lieu of the actual construction of the physical improvements required and the completion
of construction occurring prior to recording the final plat, the Governing Body may either (a) waive
any requirement of guarantee of installation or (b) accept one of the following methods of guarantee
provided it is in accordance with the policies of the Governing Body.
a. Fiscal sureties may be offered subject to the following:
1. The subdivider shall enter into a sub dividers agreement with the Governing Body
under which the subdivider agrees to install such required improvements. Such
agreement shall be conditioned upon the acceptances of the final plat by the
Governing Body and its filing with the Cloud County Register of Deeds.
2. Simultaneously with the execution of the sub divider’s agreement, the subdivider
shall furnish a corporate completion bond by a firm authorized to do business in
Kansas with good and sufficient sureties thereon or a cashier's check, escrow account
or irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the Governing Body, in the amount of the
estimated cost as approved by the official responsible for setting and enforcing the
applicable design and construction standards of the installation of the required
improvements. Such financial guarantee shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of
the final plat and further conditioned upon the actual completion and satisfactory
installation of such required improvements within two years from the date that the
final plat is accepted by the Governing Body.
3. Simultaneously with the execution of the sub divider’s agreement, if the subdivider
furnishes a corporate completion bond, he or shall also deposit in escrow an amount
equal to the cost of all improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and
specifications for required improvements or an equivalent amount in the form of a
maintenance bond or other securities that may be deemed sufficient by the Governing
Body. If a subdivider furnishes a cashier's check, escrow account or irrevocable letter
of credit, 15% of the amount of such guarantees shall be held as a deposit in escrow
after the final completion of such improvements.
4. The subdivider shall agree that the deposit in escrow may be held by the Governing
Body for a period of 18 months after such improvements are completed for the
9-2
purpose of:
(a) Guaranteeing and securing the correction of any defect in material or
workmanship furnished for such improvements, latent in character,
and not discernible at the time of final inspection or acceptance by the
Governing Body; and
(b) Guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of the
settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof.
(c) Such escrow agreement shall provide that, as such defects have so
developed, that the deposit may be applied by the Governing Body for
any amounts incurred correcting such defects; and that the balance of
such deposit, if any, held at the end of such 18-month period shall be
returned by the Governing Body to the depositor, or paid to the order
of the depositor without payment of interest.
b. Petitions to the Governing Body may be submitted as a means of guaranteeing the
authority to install improvements at such time as the Governing Body deems appropriate.
Petitions may be submitted only when the following conditions exist:
1. The petitions must be brought in the manner set out under Kansas law.
2. The petitions must be approved by the Governing Body concurrently with the
acceptance of the final plat.
3. The initiating resolution for such improvement must be adopted by the Governing
Body concurrently with the petition approval or as soon thereafter as may be
provided by law.

Register of Deeds stating that such petitions have been filed and approved by the
Governing Body and that certain land within the plat as described will be liable in the
future for special assessment for the required improvements authorized.
Such a preconstruction procedure shall be temporarily conditioned on subsequent
acceptance of the final plat and a time limit for actual construction mutually agreed upon.
Maintenance guarantees may also be required by the Governing Body.
c. The subdivider shall, prior to the acceptance of the final plat, submit a letter from the
utility provider(s) involved stating that satisfactory arrangements have been made by the
subdivider guaranteeing the installation of their respective services.

9-3
these regulations and their installation certified by a licensed land surveyor on the final
plat before such plat is recorded with the Cloud County Register of Deeds.
SECTION 9-2 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
9-201. The Governing Body may, upon making a finding of necessity, require the subdivider to
install or upgrade off-site improvements located outside the perimeter of a subdivision. Such off-site
improvements should be within dedicated rights-of-way or easements and serve a public purpose.
The financing and guaranteeing of such improvements shall be administered as if they were the same
as on-site improvements. The Governing Body may require such subdivision to participate in any or
all of the following facilities and improvements, or any other off-site improvements as recommended
by the Planning Commission, if the need is created by a proposed subdivision:

addresses of all persons to receive notices. The Zoning Administrator may require such list to be
prepared by a registered abstractor. Written notices shall be mailed to all owners of land within two
hundred (200) feet of the property proposed to be split. Such owners shall have ten (10) business
days from the date of notification to notify the Zoning Administrator of any protests they may have
concerning the lot split. The ten (10) day waiting period may be waived upon submission in writing
of statements from those to be notified that they have no objection to the proposed lot split.

SECTION 12-3 CORRECTION OF PLATTING ERRORS
12-301. If, after recording a final plat, an error is found in distances, angles, bearings, subdivision or
street names, block or lot numbers, the computation of dimension or elevation or other details of the
plat, except in connection with the outer boundaries of the plat, and if the property described in that
part of the plat containing the error is under the ownership of the same person who caused the plat to
be prepared, the City Engineer, after substantiation of the existence of the error, may file an affidavit
with the Cloud County Register of Deeds that the error was made. The affidavit shall describe the
nature and extent of the error and the appropriate correction. The Cloud County Register of Deeds
shall record the affidavit and shall place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the
affidavit has been filed, the date of filing and the book and page where it is recorded. The filing of
the affidavit shall correct any errors, but shall have no effect on the validity of the plat or any
property interest recorded by reference thereto. A copy of the recorded affidavit shall be filed with
the Zoning Administrator.
SECTION 12-4 VACATION OF STREETS, ALLEYS, EASEMENTS AND PLATS
12-401. a. The following procedures are provided to vacate streets, alleys or other public

conditions attached. If the Planning Commission determines that:
(a) due and legal notice has been given;
12-3
(b) no private rights will be injured or endangered; and
(c) the public will suffer no loss or inconvenience;
then the Planning Commission shall recommend that such vacation be approved and
entered at length in the minutes. Such recommendation may provide for the
reservation to the City and/or the owners of any lesser property rights for public
utilities, rights-of-way and easements for public service facilities originally located in
such vacated land or planned for the future. The petition shall not be recommended
by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a written
objection is filed with the City Clerk by any owner who would be a proper party to
the petition, but has not joined therein. Furthermore, when only a portion of a street,
alley or public reservation is proposed to be vacated, the petition shall not be
recommended by the Planning Commission nor granted by the Governing Body if a
written objection is filed with the City Clerk by any owner of lands which adjoin the
portion to be vacated. The recommendation of the Planning Commission to the
Governing Body shall be made as provided by K.S.A. 12-752 for the submission and
approval of a final plat, and the Governing Body may approve or disapprove the
vacation or approve it with or without reservation of lesser easements than as
recommended by the Planning Commission.
