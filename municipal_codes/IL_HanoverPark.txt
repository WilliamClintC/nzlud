PREFACE 
    This volume is a republication of the 1975 Municipal Code of Hanover Park, as supplemented through Ordinance No. O-96-27, adopted May 16, 1996, and including subsequent amendments through Ordinance No. O-00-25, adopted July 6, 2000. 
    The chapters, articles, divisions and sections of the Code have been consecutively renumbered, except as otherwise noted. Chapters have been reserved to facilitate future expansion. References in the text to Code provisions have been updated to reflect the new numbers. The history note appearing in parentheses at the end of each section shows the source of the section and its section number in the 1975 Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code. 
    New state law reference notes have been added and existing references have been verified and updated. A new state law reference table has been prepared. A uniform system of punctuation, capitalization, and expression of numbers has been used. Obvious typographical errors and misspellings have been corrected without notation. Material added to the text by the editor for clarity is enclosed in brackets. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    As part of the republication project, a new comprehensive index was prepared. Each subject has been placed under several headings, some couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references in the index to assist the user.

Municipal Code Corporation and the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois. 
    The following paragraphs are reprinted from the preface of the 1975 Code: 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the President and Board of Trustees and is the first such codification for the Village of Hanover Park since 1963. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature, prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the Village, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the thirtieth section of Chapter 4 is 4-30. Under this system, each section is identified by its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections may be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If it is desired to add new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-4 and 5-5, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2 and 5-4.3. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. For example, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The Village Board and other officials wish to recognize former Trustees Thomas W. Evert and William A. Rietz, under whose terms this Code was conceived. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and James S. Vaught, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Louis F. Barone, President, Mrs. Sonya A. Crawshaw, Village Clerk, Mr. R.D. Heninger, Village Manager and Mr. Norman Samelson, Village Attorney and to the members of the Board of Trustees for their cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois.

Sec. 1-12. - Supervision as an alternative penalty. 
(A)  In any case involving a charge of violation of an ordinance of the Village of Hanover Park, upon a) a plea of guilty, or b) a stipulation by the defendant to the facts supporting the charge, or c) a finding of guilt after trial, the court, in its sole discretion, may defer further proceedings and the imposition of a sentence, and enter an order for supervision of the defendant for a period not to exceed two years. In determining whether supervision is appropriate, the court shall consider the circumstances of the offense and the history, character and condition of the defendant. Supervision may be ordered if the court is of the opinion that: 
(1)  The defendant is not likely to commit further ordinance violations or crimes; 
(2)  The defendant and the public would best be served if the offense were not on the defendant's record; 
(3)  In the best interests of justice an order of supervision is more appropriate than a sentence otherwise permitted under this Code. 
(B)  No order of supervision shall be entered where the defendant has previously been placed on supervision by any court for any ordinance or statute violation committed less than 12 months prior to the date of the instant offense. Under no circumstances shall any person be placed on supervision for violation of this Code if such person has been previously placed on supervision for any offenses two or more times. 
(C)  For violation of any traffic offense contained in chapter 62 of this Code, the court shall consult an available abstract of the driving record of the defendant, or shall question the defendant under oath with regard to his past driving history. The court shall consider the statement of the prosecuting authority with regard to the standards set forth in this section. 
(D)  Except as otherwise provided, no order of supervision may be entered for a violation of this Code unless as a condition of supervision, a fine of not less than the minimum fine for that violation, exclusive of court costs, is also assessed. This fine may be waived or reduced if the person, testifying under oath, satisfies the court that it would be an undue financial hardship to pay such a fine. 
(E)  The court may in addition to other reasonable conditions relating to the nature of the offense or the rehabilitation of the defendant as determined for each defendant in the proper discretion of the court require that the person: 
(1)  Make a report to and appear in person before or participate with the court or such courts, person, or social service agency as directed by the court in the order of supervision; 
(2)  Pay a fine and costs; 
(3)  Work or pursue a course of study or vocational training; 
(4)  Undergo medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment; or treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism; 
(5)  Attend or reside in a facility established for the instruction or residence of defendants on probation; 
(6)  Support his dependents; 
(7)  Refrain from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon; 
(8)  And in addition, if a minor; 
(i)  Reside in his parents' or in a foster home; 
(ii)  Attend school; 
(iii)  Attend a nonresidential program for youth; 
(iv)  Contribute to his own support at home or in a foster home; and 
(9)  Make restitution or reparation in an amount not to exceed actual loss or damage to property and pecuniary loss. The court shall determine the amount and conditions of payment; 
(10)  Perform some reasonable public service work such as but not limited to the picking up of litter in public parks or along public highways or the maintenance of public facilities.

Sec. 6-16. - Variations. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The variation process is intended to provide limited relief in instances where the literal provisions of this article create undue and unnecessary hardship in such a way as to prevent property owner from displaying a sign as intended by this article. 
(b)  Application and processing-Residential, business, limited office and industrial districts. 
(1)  Variation requests may be made by the property owner or an authorized designee on which the proposed sign is to be placed and shall be filed with the zoning administrator on the appropriate application form. A completed application shall include the following information: 
a.  The name, address and phone number of the property owner. 
b.  A written description and justification of the requested variation and Code section to be varied. 
c.  The location of the building, structure, or lot on which the proposed sign is to be placed. 
d.  A current plat of survey of the property, showing accurate placement of the proposed sign. 
e.  Seven copies of a blueprint or ink drawing of the specifications of the proposed sign including the method of construction, type of sign, materials, color, size, type of illumination (if applicable), and attachment to the building or ground. 
f.  Seven copies of landscape or elevation plans or such additional information as required by the zoning administrator to accurately describe the variation request. 
g.  A letter from the property owner indicating approval of the sign as submitted. 
(2)  A complete application, including all required supporting documentation and hearing fees, shall be submitted to the zoning administrator at least four weeks prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the development commission to be scheduled for a public hearing on that date. The zoning administrator shall forward the appropriate materials along with a recommendation for approval or denial of the petition to the development commission at least seven days prior to the hearing.

The decision of the president and board of trustees thereon shall be final. 
(c)  Standards. 
(1)  The development commission shall not recommend approval of any variance unless it conforms to the standards set forth in section 110-4.7.8 of this Code. 
(d)  Authorized sign variations. 
(1)  Variations from the regulations of this article may be considered by the development commission and approved by the president and board of trustees only in the following instances, and no others: 
a.  To permit the erection of a sign for a legal nonconforming use in a residential zone which would not conform to the regulations of a residential district, but which would not exceed the regulations for a sign located in a business district. 
b.  To permit the location of an off-premise sign within 500 feet of the premise, where it can be demonstrated that because of unique physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific business premises, a particular hardship would be brought on the owner, and no other reasonable alternatives exist which would conform to this article. Such sign must comply with all other regulations of the district in which it is located. 
c.  To permit a variation from the maximum number, location, and area of wall signs allowed for a business located in a shopping center where it can be demonstrated that due to a unique configuration of the shopping center, the business does not have direct building display frontage to a street and therefore is unable to erect a wall sign adequate to meet the advertising needs of the business under the provisions of this article. In no case shall the number of permitted wall signs be increased greater than two, and the permissible signable area shall not be increased greater than 20 percent. 
d.  To permit an increase in the number of directional signs allowed on a business property where it can be demonstrated that due to a unique configuration of the parcel, additional traffic control signage is required to promote safe on-site circulation, or in the instance of a business which requires unusual on-site traffic circulation due to a multi-lane drive-through or other unique business use. The number of on-site directional signs shall not be increased more than 75 percent. The number of directional signs at each curb cut shall not exceed one. 
e.  To permit an increase in the maximum square footage of a public building or religious institution building identification sign for public building or religious institution building with seating capacity exceeding 500. Larger buildings generally draw attendees from greater distances and in larger numbers and therefore require a larger identification sign. In no case shall an identification sign exceed a maximum of 100 square feet per side, or be permitted to exceed ten feet in height. Any public building or religious institution building requesting such a variance must provide proof of seating capacity. 
f.  To permit a freestanding sign to have more than two sides on unusually shaped lots where it can be demonstrated that a two-sided sign will not be clearly visible from all street directions. No sign shall be permitted to have more than three sides and the total square footage for the freestanding sign in the district where the sign is located shall not be exceeded. 
g.  To permit the reconstruction of an existing, legal, nonconforming shopping center identification sign at the same gross sign area as the existing sign. The height of the sign and all other characteristics of the sign must be brought into compliance with this article at the time of construction. A legal, nonconforming shopping center identification sign shall not be permitted to be reconstructed greater than 428 square feet in gross surface area. If the shopping [center] is allowed a second freestanding identification sign under the provisions of this article, the total square footage for both signs shall not exceed 428 square feet. 
h.  To permit a shopping center wall identification sign where a unique site configuration creates the need for additional shopping center identification in addition to or in lieu of, a freestanding sign the sign shall not exceed 75 percent of the total permitted area of the allowed freestanding sign, or of the larger freestanding sign where two freestanding signs are permitted for the shopping center, and shall conform to the shopping center sign plan. The wall sign shall include the name of the shopping center and may include tenant panels provided they do not exceed the maximum sign area for the sign. Each tenant panel shall be a minimum of 12 inches in height and shall only list the name of a shopping center tenant. The wall sign shall face the arterial street which the shopping center fronts and no variation shall be given allowing the wall sign to face a residential district. Such identification sign may be a box sign. 
i.  To permit the construction or modification of an existing legal non-conforming sign due only to height and area in order to include on the sign the advertising of an adjacent business, on an adjacent property provided the business building is physically attached to the business building property upon which the sign is located in, provided the constructed or modified sign includes a masonry monument base, does not exceed 25 feet in height nor exceed 214 square feet in area. 
(e)  Conditions and restrictions. 
(1)  The development commission may recommend to the president and board of trustees that a variation be granted when it shall be determined from evidence presented at the public hearing that the variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the petitioner but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable hardship or unusual practical difficulty and that the granting of the variation will not in any way be inconsistent with the intent, purpose, and objectives of this article. 
(2)  In any case where a variation has been granted, and where no work pertinent thereto has been initiated within one calendar year from the date of approval from the president and board of trustees, then without further action by either the development commission or the president and board of trustees, said variation shall become null and void.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 26-1. - Purpose. 
    The president and board of trustees of the Village of Hanover Park, having found and determined that there is an increasing percentage of residential units in the village that are intended for condominium development and that a considerable portion of the village's rental housing is or may be converted to condominium status; that the prospective purchasers of these condominium units are often without knowledge of the unique concepts of ownership involved; that prospective purchasers of units in condominium conversions or in newly constructed condominiums often have little factual basis presented to them on which to make a decision that existing tenants of such projects may be displaced with insufficient time to find replacement housing in the area; and that in order to facilitate fair and equitable bargaining and to provide buyers of such condominium units with basic information by which to make an intelligent housing choice and promote the health, safety and welfare of the people, it is necessary and appropriate for the village to require that developers of condominium projects prepare and distribute information deemed relevant to the purchasers of this type of residential property.

Sec. 26-121. - Village inspections and reports. 
(a)  Any developer desiring to sell a unit as regulated by this chapter shall apply to the department for a certificate of occupancy with respect to such unit and with respect to the common elements of the property containing the unit. The applicant shall submit with the application the declaration and plat pertaining to the property and "as built" architectural drawings of the building and site development certified by a registered architect, provided that for conversion condominiums the developer need only submit what architectural drawings it has under its control. 
(b)  The village manager or his designee shall thereupon cause a visual inspection to be made of the unit and of the common elements to ascertain compliance with current codes. Based on said visual inspection, if any such unit is determined not to be in compliance with current codes, the developer may submit a request in writing for a waiver of the application of current codes to the village manager who will notify the president and board of trustees of said request. The village manager or his designee shall issue an opinion to the president and board of trustees as to whether the items requested to be waived pertain to life/safety factors of the applicable codes and whether he recommends for or against such a waiver, and the president and board of trustees shall, within 21 days of a request for waiver, grant or deny same, in whole or in part and upon such conditions as the president and board of trustees deem necessary to protect the public health, welfare and safety. 
    If a waiver is granted, the developer shall give to all prospective purchasers after the date of waiver, in addition to the other documents required by this chapter, and to all persons who have executed contracts for the purchase of a unit, within seven days of the date the waiver is given, a copy of the ordinance granting same, with a notice in substantially the following form attached thereto: 
NOTICE TO CONDOMINIUM BUYERS: 
The Village of Hanover Park in recognition of its responsibility to protect its current and future residents from inadequate disclosure and other unfair sales practices in the area of condominium sales has adopted an ordinance regulating condominiums within the Village of Hanover Park. In those situations where the strict enforcement of the provisions of that ordinance would produce an extreme financial hardship or result in a practical confiscation of property based upon evidence submitted by the developer or others on his behalf, the board of trustees has deemed it appropriate to grant a waiver from those provisions of that ordinance, thereby excusing the developer from certain responsibilities in connection with the condominium conversion. The granting of a waiver should not be construed to infer that the developer is or is not in compliance with all other village requirements. 
Section 26-121(b) of the Village Code requires a developer to give prospective purchasers a copy of the ordinance waiving any requirements of the village. Attached is a copy of said waiver ordinance. 
(c)  After the inspection, as provided for above, has been completed and compliance with current codes has been ascertained or waived pursuant to section 26-121(b) hereof, the department shall issue a certificate of occupancy with respect to each unit inspected. All of the certificates issued shall include therein a specification of each separate condition of noncompliance which has been waived pursuant to section 26-121(b) hereof. The department shall also issue to such applicant clear and legible copies of said certificates suitable for posting. 
(d)  Except as otherwise contained herein, no certificate of occupancy shall be issued if such unit, or the common elements pertaining thereto, are not in compliance with current codes. No closing on the sale of any condominium unit shall take place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the unit and common elements. 
(e)  Upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy for a unit, it shall become the obligation of the applicant to keep copies of the certificates of occupancy for the common elements and all units in the sales office at the project and to make said certificates available for inspection by prospective purchasers and the village. The developer shall maintain documentation pertaining to each unit to establish that the purchaser of such unit has received from him or his agent a copy of the certificate of occupancy pertaining thereto at or before closing. These records shall be maintained and available for examination by appropriate authorities of the village.

Additionally, one copy of the drawings and plans shall be given to the board of managers of the condominium association when control of the common elements are turned over to it. It shall be obligatory upon the board of managers to retain such drawings and plans in its custody.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 38-1. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be designated as the "Engineering Standards and Specifications for the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois." 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-1; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(1.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-2. - Intent and purpose. 
    While it is obvious that regulations are needed to assure orderly extension of village improvements, the other purposes of these regulations are: 
(a)  To insure sound, harmonious development and community growth, and to safeguard the interest of the owner, the developer, the investor and the village. 
(b)  To provide permanent assets to the locality and to the village. 
(c)  To minimize scattered development beyond existing public utilities and prevent excessive development costs. 
(d)  To assure the development of land for optimum use with necessary protection against deterioration and obsolescence. 
(e)  To limit and control the pollution of the environment that can be caused by inadequate or incomplete urban development. 
(f)  To provide common grounds of understanding and a sound working relationship between the village and the developer. 
(g)  To lessen congestion in the streets and highways. 
(h)  To attempt to provide for adequate light and air. 
(i)  To facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools and other public necessities. 
(j)  To ensure proper legal description and proper monumenting of subdivided land. 
    The regulations are established with reasonable consideration of the character of the village with a view toward conserving the value of buildings upon the land and providing the best possible environment for human habitation. It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and development standards contained in the building code, official map regulations, zoning ordinance, and the official village comprehensive plan, and the subdivision regulations. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-2; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(2.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-3. - Jurisdiction. 
    The engineering standards and specifications of the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois shall apply to all improvements as defined herein, located within the Village of Hanover Park and entirely or in part within the unincorporated area within 11/2 miles of the corporate limits of the village, in accordance with chapter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.), as amended. The proposed improvements to be installed, and all procedures relating thereto, shall in all respects be in full compliance with the regulations herein. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-3; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(3.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-4. - Improvements generally. 
(a)  Public improvements. The public improvement requirements, standards and specifications contained herein are adopted as the minimum required standards and specifications for public improvements of the village. When public improvements are required by application for subdivision, no such improvements may be made until the plats for the subdivision and also the plans for improvements thereto have been formally recommended by the Hanover Park Plan Commission and approved by the board of trustees. The village engineer is designated as the enforcing officer of the public improvement requirements, standards and specifications contained herein. When public improvements are made other than as part of the subdivision no such improvements may be made until the plans are approved by the village engineer. If any improvements are being constructed in violation of regulations contained herein, it shall be the responsibility of the village engineer, or his designee, to stop such construction until there is full compliance with said regulations. 
(b)  No improvements shall be approved for any use in any area which is determined after investigation by the village engineer to be located within areas of special flood hazard until the subdivider has complied with article III of this chapter. 
(c)  No improvements shall be approved for any use in any area which is determined after investigation by the village engineer, to be unsuitable for such a use by reason of flooding or bad drainage, adverse earth and rock formation or topography, or any other features likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
    Unsuitable land and any improvements located within areas of special flood hazard and identified in article III of this chapter shall be subject to the provisions of that article. 
    Unsuitable land and any improvements located outside of special flood hazard may be developed only if the developer agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the village engineer, make the area safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage and stormwater detention facilities. 
(d)  Where the developer of land outside areas of special flood hazard can show in writing and with appropriate documentation that the strict adherence to the standards and specifications set forth causes an unnecessary hardship, the village board may approve a variance. Such variance may be granted after recommendation by the village engineer and where topography and conditions peculiar to the site or surrounding area substantiates a variance without destroying the intent of the provisions of this chapter. 
    Variances for land within areas of special flood hazard shall be subject to the provisions of article III of this chapter. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-4; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(4.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-5. - Interpretation. 
(a)  Minimum standards established. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Higher standards govern. Where the conditions imposed by any other provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
(c)  Easements or covenants not abrogated. This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other private agreement, the requirements of this chapter shall govern. 
(d)  Existing improvements. No improvements which were not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, shall be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this chapter; and to the extent that said improvements are in conflict in any manner with the requirements of this chapter, said improvements remain unlawful hereunder.

(1)  Substantial damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cumulative percentage of damage during the life of the building equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred regardless of actual repair work performed. Volunteer labor and materials must be included in this determination. The terms includes repetitive loss buildings. 
(ww)  Substantial improvement. Any repairs, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either: 
(1)  Before the improvement or repair is started; or 
(2)  If the structure has been damaged and is being restored before the damage occurred. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for the improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places.

Sec. 38-63. - How to use this article. 
    The village engineer shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 38-64. To fulfill those duties, the village engineer first should use the criteria listed in section 38-65, Base flood elevation, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the village engineer must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a regulatory floodway or within a SFHA or floodplain on which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section 38-66 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section 38-67 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the village engineer shall require that the minimum requirements of section 38-68 be met. 
    In addition, the general requirements of section 38-69 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of section 38-66, 38-67 or 38-68. The village engineer shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of section 38-70. 
    If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the village engineer shall review the requirements of section 38-71 to make sure that they are met. In addition, the village engineer shall complete all notification requirements. 
    In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this article, the village engineer may take any and all actions as outlined in section 38-73.

(c)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A zone on the flood insurance rate map of the village shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-2, WSP-2 or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrological model, such as HEC-1, TR-20 or HIP or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to the IDNR/OWR for approval; once approved, it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey. 
(d)  Any SFHAs in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) and any additional property subject to flooding which is included within the area of the study and maps entitled "Stormwater Management Study for the West Branch of the Du Page River in Hanover Park, Illinois," prepared by the Envirodyne Engineers, Inc., dated September, 1989, shall have the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation delineated in said study and maps.

Sec. 38-66. - Occupation and use of flood fringe areas. 
    Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation and compensatory storage and other provisions of this article are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section along with the requirements of section 38-69: 
(a)  Development permit. No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the building official. 
(b)  Permit application. An application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the building official. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and the legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in MSL, NAVD 88 and all charges in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings, the elevation of the lowest flood (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans, and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 38-69 of this article. 
(c)  Receipt of application. Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building official shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that the ground elevation existed prior to the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(d)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control plan. A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
(e)  Additional required permits. The building official shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The building official shall not issue a permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(f)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
(g)  Using fill. If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from the FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
(h)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-36; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989; Ord. No. O-08-25, § 9, 4-3-2008)

The building official shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits and approvals that may be required for this type of activity. The building official shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A registered professional engineer under the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section. 
(d)  Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Illinois Administrative Code 3708 will be allowed. "Appropriate uses" do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting design to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
(1)  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control or drainage, flooding, erosion or water quality or habitat for fish or wildlife; 
(2)  Structures or facilities relating to the use of or required access to the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water-dependent uses; 
(3)  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls; 
(4)  Underground and overhead utilities; 
(5)  Recreational facilities, such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows and including open air pavilions; 
(6)  Detached garages, storage sheds or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing buildings that will not block flood flows or reduce floodway storage; 
(7)  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto; 
(8)  Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where the depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below ground elevation; 
(9)  Regulatory floodway regrading without fill to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse; 
(10)  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure; 
(11)  In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building before it was damaged or replaced and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building; 
(12)  Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's footprint and are valued at less than 50 percent of the market value of the building. 
(e)  Construction of appropriate use. Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory floodway maps designated by the IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 38-69 of this article: 
(1)  Preservation of flood conveyance so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway conveyance, the following facts shall be taken into consideration: 
a.  Regulatory floodway conveyance, 2/3 : 
  
K = 1.486 AR / n 
Where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter (see Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York). 
b.  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a record maintenance agreement with the federal, state or local unit of government can assure that the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
c.  A transition section shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
1.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expend no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
2.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
3.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
4.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
5.  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
(2)  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. Compensatory storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All regulatory flood storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to the IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at the existing structure. 
(3)  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of bridges or culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures. 
(4)  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks), such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact the IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver. 
a.  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 38-65 of this article. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/FHWA Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculation procedures. 
b.  Lost floodway storage must be compensated per subsection 38-67(e)(2). 
c.  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection 38-67(e)(3). 
d.  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, a IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
e.  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to the IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by subsection 38-67(d). 
f.  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection 38-67(e)(8). 
(5)  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts and approach roads. 
a.  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1-foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
b.  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
c.  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with IDNR/OWR rules, 17 Illinois Administrative Code 3708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois), and submitted to the IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
(6)  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 foot, when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from the IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, for a dam safety permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in subsection 38-62(l) shall meet the permitted [permit] requirements of 92 Illinois Administrative Code 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation or regional stormwater detention; 
b.  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
c.  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
d.  A nonpoint-source-control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
e.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 38-67. 
(7)  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet from the outside of the building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
(8)  Excavation in the floodway. When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to the IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
a.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
b.  When water is flowing from a wider section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length; and 
c.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
d.  Erosion/scour protection shall be provided upstream and downstream of the transition sections. 
(9)  Channel modification. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
a.  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high-flow channel or the establishment of a streamside buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and to improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
b.  Water quality, habitat and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification, and no significant habitat area may be destroyed or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
c.  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
1.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design where practical. 
2.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
3.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
4.  Clearing of vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for the construction of the channel. 
5.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical wherever practicable. Natural vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials, such as concrete, gabions or construction rubble, should be avoided unless there are not practicable alternatives. 
6.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to the establishment of the vegetative cover. 
7.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity, such as deep pools, riffles and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established where appropriate. 
8.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
9.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry, and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to the diversion of water into the new channel. 
10.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
11.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and 
d.  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 38-67. 
(10)  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
(11)  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling and excavation, in which there is potential for the erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed, consistent with the following criteria: 
a.  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time that the soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of the improvements. 
b.  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after the final grade is reached on any portion of the site and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
c.  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches and sediment basins. 
d.  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished where possible along existing channels (subsection 38-67(e)(16)). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
e.  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois, 1988, also known as the "Green Book," and Standards and Specifications for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control (IEPA, 1987). 
(12)  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to the IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(13)  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
a.  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in section 38-65, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, the IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
b.  If the 100-year regulatory floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
c.  If the applicant learns from the IDNR/OWR, local governments or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
(14)  Conditional letter of map revision. If the appropriate use would result in a change in the regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to the IDNR/OWR and to the FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from the IDNR/OWR conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway map will not be changed by the IDNR/OWR until as-built plans or record drawings are submitted and accepted by the FEMA and the IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by the FEMA and the IDNR/OWR. 
(15)  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
(16)  Construction within 25 feet of the channel. For all activities in the floodway involving construction within 25 feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least 25 feet of the ordinary high-water mark of the channel. 
b.  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon the completion of construction. 
c.  The use of native riparian vegetation is preferred in the buffer strip. Access through this buffer strip shall be provided when necessary for stream maintenance purposes. 
After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed, but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by the IDNR/OWR and the FEMA of the as-built plans. 
(f)  State review. For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria shall be submitted to the IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit. 
(1)  The IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant to subsection 38-67(e)(4). 
(2)  The IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile pursuant to subsection 38-67(e)(5). 
(3)  The IDNR/OWR will review alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to subsections 38-67(e)(1), (2) and (8). 
(4)  The IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams (as defined in subsection 38-62(l) and all other state, federal or local units of government projects, including projects of the municipality or county. 
(g)  Other permits. In addition to the other requirements of this article, a development permit for a site located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written documentation that a permit is not required from the IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 ILCS 5/4.9, as amended. No permit from the IDNR/OWR shall be required if the IDNR/OWR has delegated this responsibility to the village. 
(h)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam as defined in subsection 38-62(l) per 17 Illinois Administrative Code 3702 (Rules for Construction of Dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the village engineer finds a dam that does not have a IDNR/OWR permit, the village engineer shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the IDNR/OWR. If the village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam, the IDNR/OWR, the dam safety section in Springfield and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA). 
(i)  Activities that do not require a registered professional engineer's review. The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article, including the mitigation requirements: 
(1)  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
a.  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
b.  Require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
c.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream bed; and 
d.  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
(2)  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
a.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; and 
b.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
c.  Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location. 
(3)  Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground equipment and patios at grade. 
(4)  Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that: 
a.  Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length. 
b.  Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank. 
c.  Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel or bank of the lake. 
d.  Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials, such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions, should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(5)  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
a.  The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above natural grade. 
b.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert. 
c.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
d.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
e.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-37; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989; Ord. No. O-93-13, §§ 2-4, 4-1-1993; Ord. No. O-00-28, § 2, 8-3-2000; Ord. No. O-08-25, §§ 10-14, 4-3-2008) 
Sec. 38-68. - Occupation and use of SFHA areas where floodways are not identified. 
    In SFHA or floodplains where no floodways have been identified, and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by the FEMA and draining more than a square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated cases and structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor significantly increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
(a)  Development permit. No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in an SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development permit from the building official. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the building official. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions; and existing grade elevations and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation at the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of section 38-69 of this article. 
The application for a development permit shall also include the following information: 
(1)  A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose and intended use; 
(2)  Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area; 
(3)  Anticipated dates of initiation and completion of the activity; 
(4)  Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided, which include as a minimum: 
a.  A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, the name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of roads in the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale and north arrow; 
b.  A plan view of the project and engineering study, each showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (NAVD 88), adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control easements, the distance between the proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and orientation of cross sections, north arrow and a graphical or numerical scale; 
c.  Cross section views of the project and engineering study, each showing existing and proposed conditions, including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and proposed elevations, normal water elevation, ten-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year frequency flood elevation and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and 
d.  A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of the final stabilization and revegetation measures and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance; 
(5)  Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted, showing that the proposed work will meet the criteria of subsection 38-68(d); 
(6)  Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of development. 
(b)  Elevation of site. Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository, the village engineer shall compare the elevation of the sites to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection 38-65(d). Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. The building official shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
(c)  Additional required permits. The building official shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The building official shall not issue the development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained. 
(d)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the SFHA where a floodway has not been determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or threat to public health, safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel or impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. 
(e)  Undetermined floodways. Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the project meets the engineering requirements of subsections 38-67(e)(1) through (12) for the entire floodplain as calculated under the provisions of subsection 38-65(d) of this article. As an alternative, the developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that engineering study to the IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the requirements of section 38-67 for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be defined according to the definition in subsection 38-62(oo) of this article. 
(2)  A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit from the IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from the IDNR/OWR. 
(3)  No permit from the IDNR/OWR shall be required if the IDNR/OWR has delegated permit responsibility to the village (per 17 Illinois Administrative Code, Part 3708), for regulatory floodways, per the IDNR/OWR statewide permit entitled "Construction in Floodplains With No Designated Floodways in Northeastern Illinois." 
(4)  Dam safety permits. Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an on-stream structure to impound water as defined in subsection 38-62(l) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter indicating that a permit is not required prior to the start of the construction of a dam. If the village engineer finds a dam that does not have a IDNR/OWR permit, the village engineer shall immediately notify the dam safety section of the IDNR/OWR. If the village engineer finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the village engineer shall immediately notify the owner of the dam and the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency (ESDA) and the IDNR/OWR, dam safety section, in Springfield. 
(5)  The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review or the calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still meet the other requirements of this article: 
a.  Underground and overhead utilities that: 
1.  Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations; or 
2.  Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway; or 
3.  In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a minimum of three feet below the existing stream bed; and 
4.  In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris. 
b.  Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that: 
1.  Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope; and 
2.  Do not result in an increase in ground elevation; and 
3.  Are designed so as not to cause stream bank erosion at the outfall location. 
c.  Construction of shoreline and stream bed protection that: 
1.  Does not exceed 1,000 feet in length or two cubic yards per lineal foot of stream bed. 
2.  Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of the bank. 
3.  Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross-sectional area of the stream channel by more than ten percent. 
4.  Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials, such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions, should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
d.  Temporary stream crossings in which: 
1.  The approach roads will be 0.5 foot or less above the natural grade. 
2.  The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank vegetation line or above any drainage tile or outfall invert. 
3.  The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet below the top of the lowest bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel. 
4.  All disturbed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon installation and again upon removal of construction. 
5.  The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization. 
e.  The construction of light poles, sign posts and similar structures. 
f.  The construction of sidewalks, driveways, athletic fields (excluding fences), patios and similar surfaces which are built at grade. 
g.  The construction of properly anchored, unwalled, open structures, such as playground equipment, pavilions and carports, built at or below the existing grade that would not obstruct the flow of floodwaters. 
h.  The placement of properly anchored buildings not exceeding 70 square feet in size nor ten feet in any one dimension (e.g., animal shelters and tool sheds). 
i.  The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by more than 20 percent, which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the existing building and which do extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are parallel to the flow of floodwaters. 
j.  Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where: 
1.  The affected length of stream is less than 1,000 feet; 
2.  The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels; or 
3.  The cross-sectional area of the dredged channel conforms to that of the natural channel upstream and downstream of the site. 
(6)  The flood-carrying capacity within any altered or relocated watercourse shall be maintained. 
(f)  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-38; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989; Ord. No. O-93-13, §§ 5-7, 4-1-1993; Ord. No. O-00-28, § 2, 8-3-2000; Ord. No. O-08-25, §§ 15-17, 4-3-2008) 
Sec. 38-69. - Permitting requirements applicable to all floodplain areas. 
    In addition to the requirements found in sections 38-66 through 38-68 for development in flood fringes, regulatory floodways and SFHAs or floodplains where no floodways have been identified (zones A, AO, AH, AE, A1-A30, A99, VO, V1-30, VE, V, M or E), the following requirements shall be met: 
(a)  Public health standards. 
(b)  No developments in the SFHA shall include locating or storing chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable liquids, pollutants or other hazardous or toxic materials below the FPE. 
(c)  New and replacement water supply systems, wells, sanitary sewer lines and on-site waste disposal systems may be permitted, providing that all manholes or other aboveground openings located below the FPE are watertight. 
(d)  Carrying capacity and notification. For all projects involving channel modification, fill or stream maintenance (including levees), the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse shall be maintained. In addition, the village shall notify adjacent communities in writing 30 days prior to the issuance of a permit for the alteration or relocation of the watercourse. 
(e)  Protecting buildings. All buildings located within a 100-year floodplain, also known as an SFHA, shall be protected from flood damage below the flood protection elevation. However, existing buildings located within a regulatory floodway shall also meet the more restrictive appropriate use standards included in section 38-67. These building protection criteria apply to the following situations: 
(1)  Construction or placement of a new building; 
(2)  A structural alteration to an existing building that either increases the first floor area by more than 20 percent or the building's market value by more than 50 percent; 
(3)  Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This building protection requirement does not apply to returning a mobile home to the same site that it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage; and 
(4)  Installing a travel trailer on a site for more than 180 days. 
This building protection requirement may be met by one of the following methods. 
(f)  A residential or nonresidential building, when allowed, may be constructed on permanent landfill in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The lowest floor (including basement) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation. The flood protection elevation shall be one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compaction and should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the building before sloping below the flood protection elevation. The top of the fill shall be above the flood protection elevation. However, the ten-foot minimum may be waived if a structural engineer certifies an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour. The fill shall not adversely effect the flow or surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties. 
(g)  A residential or nonresidential building may be elevated in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The building or improvements shall be elevated on crawl space, stilts, piles, walls or other foundation that is permanently open to floodwaters and not subject to damage by hydrostatic pressures of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The permanent openings shall be no more than one foot above grade and consist of a minimum of two openings. The openings must have a total net area of not less than one square inch of every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding below the base flood elevation. 
(2)  The foundation and supporting members shall be anchored and aligned in relation to flood flows and adjoining structures so as to minimize exposure to known hydrodynamic forces, such as current, waves, ice and floating debris. 
(3)  All areas below the flood protection elevation shall be constructed of materials resistant to flood damage. The lowest floor (including basement) and all electrical, heating, ventilating, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and utility meters shall be located at or above the flood protection elevation. Water and sewer pipes, electrical and telephone lines, submersible pumps and other waterproofed service facilities may be located below the flood protection elevation. 
(4)  No area below the flood protection elevation shall be used for storage of items or materials. 
(5)  Manufactured homes and travel trailers to be installed on a site for more than 180 days shall be elevated to or above the flood protection elevation and shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement by being tied down in accordance with the rules and regulations for the Illinois Mobile Home Tie-Down Act (210 ILCS 120/1 et seq.), as amended, issued pursuant to 77 Illinois Administrative Code 870. 
(h)  Only a nonresidential building may be structurally floodproofed (in lieu of elevation), provided that a registered professional engineer shall certify that the building has been structurally dry floodproofed below the flood protection elevation and the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The building design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effects of buoyancy and impacts from debris or ice. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity. (Levees, berms, floodwalls and similar works are not considered floodproofing for the purpose of this subsection.) 
(i)  Nonconforming structures located in a regulatory floodway may remain in use but may not be enlarged, replaced or structurally altered. A nonconforming structure damaged by flood, fire, wind or other natural or manmade disaster may be restored unless the damage exceeds 50 percent of its market value before it was damaged; in which case, it shall conform to this article. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-39; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989) 
Sec. 38-70. - Other development requirements. 
    The board of trustees shall take into account flood hazards to the extent that they are known in all official actions related to land management, use and development: 
(a)  New subdivisions, manufactured home parks, annexation agreements and planned unit developments (PUDs) within the SFHA shall be reviewed to assure that the proposed developments are consistent with section 38-66 through 38-69 of this article and the need to minimize flood damage. Plats or plans for new subdivisions, mobile home parks and planned unit developments (PUDs) shall include a signed statement by a registered professional engineer that the plat or plans account for changes in the drainage of surface waters in accordance with the Plat Act (765 ILCS 205/2), amended. 
(b)  Proposals for new subdivisions, manufactured home parks, travel trailer parks, planned unit developments (PUDs) and additions to manufactured home parks and additions to subdivisions shall include base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation data and floodway delineations. Where this information is not available from an existing study filed with the Illinois State Water Survey, the applicant's engineer shall be responsible for calculating the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation per subsection 38-65(d) and the floodway delineation per the definition in subsection 38-62(oo) and submitting it to the state water survey and the IDNR/OWR for review and approval as best available regulatory data. 
(c)  Streets, blocks, lots, parks and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to preserve and utilize natural streams and channels. Wherever possible, the floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds. 
(d)  The board of trustees shall not approve any planned unit development (PUD) or plat of subdivision located outside the corporate limits unless such agreement or plat is in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-40; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989; Ord. No. O-93-13, §§ 8, 9, 4-1-1993; Ord. No. O-00-28, § 2, 8-3-2000) 
Sec. 38-71. - Variances. 
    No variances shall be granted to any development located in a regulatory floodway as defined in subsection 38-62(m). However, when a development proposal is located outside of a regulatory floodway, and whenever the standards of this article place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the village engineer for a variance. The village engineer shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the board of trustees. 
(a)  No variance shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates that: 
(1)  The development activity cannot be located outside the SFHA; 
(2)  An exceptional hardship would result if the variance were not granted; 
(3)  The relief requested is the minimum necessary; 
(4)  There will be no additional threat to public health, safety, beneficial stream uses and functions, especially aquatic habitat, or creation of a nuisance; 
(5)  There will be no additional public expense for flood protection, lost environmental stream uses and functions, rescue or relief operations, policing or repairs to stream beds and banks, roads, utilities or other public facilities; 
(6)  The provisions of subsections 38-66(f) and 38-68(d) of this article shall still be met; 
(7)  The activity is not in a regulatory floodway; 
(8)  The applicant's circumstances are unique and do not represent a general problem; and 
(9)  The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the area involved, including existing stream uses. 
(b)  The village engineer shall notify an applicant in writing that a variance from the requirements of section 38-69 that would lessen the degree of protection to a building will: 
(1)  Result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; 
(2)  Increase the risks to life and property; and 
(3)  Require that the applicant proceed with the knowledge of these risks and that he will acknowledge in writing that he assumes the risk and liability.

Sec. 38-72. - Disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and specific methods of study. Larger floods may occur, or flood heights may be increased by manmade [or] natural causes. This article does not imply that development, either inside or outside of the SFHA, will be free from flooding or damage. This article does not create liability on the part of the village or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-42; Ord. No. O-89-41, § 1, 7-20-1989) 
Sec. 38-73. - Penalty. 
    Failure to comply with the requirements of a permit or conditions of a variance resolution shall be deemed to be a violation of this article. Upon due investigation, the village engineer may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this article exists. The village engineer shall notify the owner in writing of such violation. 
(a)  If such owner fails after ten days' notice to correct the violation: 
(1)  The village may make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this article or make such other order as the court deems necessary to secure compliance with this article. 
(2)  Any person who violates this article shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not less than $50.00 or more than $1,000.00 for each offense. 
(3)  A separate offense shall be deemed committed upon each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. 
(4)  The village may record a notice of violation on the title to the property. 
(b)  The village engineer shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and, therefore, may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall prevent the village from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

(Code 1975, § 91/2-81; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(9.01), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-172. - Design. 
    Water distribution mains shall be of adequate size and shall serve the entire development. Said mains shall be designed according to the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois or according to the Recommended Standards for Water Works. The more stringent requirements of either shall apply. Said mains shall, in general, be installed in the street right-of-way. In no case shall mains be installed within seven feet of a building in a residential district and within ten feet of a building in any other zoning district. The minimum size shall be six inches internal diameter in residential areas. In other developments, the minimum size shall be eight inches. All water mains shall be installed with a minimum depth of cover of 5.5 feet, measured from the established grade shown on the plans to the top of the pipe. Mains shall be extended to the far property line of the development along public rights-of-way and at any other location indicated by the village engineer. 
(a)  Fire protection system. The design engineer shall show in a separate report that at several locations and at any other location that may be selected by the village engineer, the proposed water main system, together with that proposed in the master plan for the Village of Hanover Park will supply the fire flow required in excess of domestic consumption demands, using a "C" factor of 100 for cast iron or ductile iron and 120 for asbestos cement or thick walled PVC water mains ignoring fittings and with a minimum residual pressure of 20 psi. 
(1)  Residence: 
a.  Dwellings, detached and semidetached: 1,000 to 1,500 gpm. 
b.  Dwellings, attached (townhouses) each unit separated by an approved firewall: 1,000 to 2,000 gpm.

Valves shall be installed so that not over 800 feet of main will be shut off at any given time unless the village engineer permits spacing at greater intervals. If a tee is installed, two valves may be utilized. The design engineer shall, by diagrams and/or written report, set forth his basis for location of water main valves. No more than 30 single-family dwelling units shall be without water with the shutting off of any three valve locations. Valve vaults are required on all valves 2.5 inches or larger. Forty-eight-inch vaults are required on valves ten inches or smaller. Sixty-inch vaults or larger are required on all other size valves. A maximum of three valves shall be used to isolate any given section of water main. 
(e)  Services. The plans except for residential developments with individual service for each unit, shall show the calculated static water pressure at the lowest and highest ground elevations on the site. Calculations shall be presented showing that the proposed water services are of a large enough size to supply an adequate flow of water at the outlet of the meter, assuming the service is "fairly rough pipe" as specified in the Illinois State Plumbing Code, current edition. 
(f)  Thrust blocks. Thrust blocks are required at all valves, hydrants, tees and bends. Engineering drawings shall indicate the location of each concrete thrust block to be installed. Where undisturbed earth is not available or not likely to be available to back up pressure-type concrete thrust blocks, the engineer shall specify tie rods with or without anchor-type concrete thrust blocks and submit design data for such specifications.

(b)  Procedure for test. Each section of pipe to be tested, as determined by the village engineer, shall be slowly filled with water and the specified test pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe in a satisfactory manner. The pump pipe connection and all necessary apparatus including gauges and meters shall be furnished by the contractor. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. To accomplish this, taps shall be made as necessary, at points of highest elevation and afterwards tightly plugged. Any cracked or defective pipes, fittings, valves or hydrants discovered in consequence of this pressure test shall be removed and replaced by the contractor with sound material and the test shall be repeated until satisfactory to the village engineer. Provisions of AWWA C-600 and C-603, where applicable, shall apply.

Sec. 38-176. - Water main leakage test. 
(a)  After completion of the pressure test, the village engineer may require a leakage test to be conducted to determine the quantity of water lost by leakage under the specified test pressure. Test pressure is defined as the maximum operating pressure of the section under test and is based on the elevation of the lowest point in the line or section under test corrected to the elevation of the test gauge. Applicable provisions of AWWA C-600 and C-603 shall apply. Duration of each leakage test shall be a minimum of one hour in addition to the pressure test period. 
(b)  Allowable leakage in gallons per hour for cast iron water main shall not be greater than that determined by the formula: 
L = ND vP 
3,700  
for mechanical joints and push-on joints, or: 
L = ND vP 
1,850  
for caulked bell-and-spigot-joints. 
Note: 
L = Allowable leakage in gallons per hour. N = Number of joints in length of pipeline tested. D = Nominal diameter of the pipe in inches. P = Average test pressure during leakage test in pounds per square inch gauge.  
    Tables of allowable leakage and basis of allowable leakage can be found in table 4 for cast iron water main. 
    Allowable leakage for asbestos-cement water pipe shall conform to provisions of AWWA C-603. Allowable leakage per 100 couplings based on 150 psi pressure represents a leakage of 30 gpd per mile of pipe per inch of diameter for pipe in 13-foot lengths. A table showing the allowable leakage is provided in table 4. 
(c)  Leakage is defined as the quantity of water to be supplied in the newly laid pipe or any valved section under test, which is necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure after the pipe has been filled with water and the air expelled. 
(d)  Flanged pipe shall be "bottle tight." 
(e)  In no case shall the leakage exceed the greater of either 3,000 gallons per day per mile of water main or three percent of total supplied water.

Sec. 38-177. - Preliminary flushing. 
    Prior to chlorination, the main shall be flushed as thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and outlets available. Flushing shall be done after the pressure test is made. It must be understood that such flushing removes only the lighter solids and cannot be relied upon to remove heavy material allowed to get into the main during laying. If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, a tap should be provided large enough to affect a velocity in the main of at least 2.5 feet per second. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-87; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(9.07), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-178. - Sterilization. 
    The preferred point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved section of it and through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid pipe. The water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe should be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline extension. In a new system application of chlorine may be made at the pumping station, the elevated tank, the standpipe or the reservoir. When properly cleaned first, these units are thus chlorinated adequately. 
    Water from the existing distribution system or other source of supply shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid pipeline during the application of chlorine. The rate of chlorine mixture flow shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the pipe that the chlorine does applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe shall be at least 40 to 50 ppm, or enough to meet the requirements during the retention period. A convenient method of determining the rate of flow of line full of water and measure the rate of discharge at a hydrant with a Pitot tube. Great flexibility is made possible by providing a series of orifices to give good gauge readings at high and low flows. 
    Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine solution in the line being treated will not flow back into the line supplying the water. 
    Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough to destroy all spore-forming bacteria. This retention period should be at least 24 hours. After the chlorine-treated water has been retained for the required time, the chlorine residual at the pipe extremities and at other representative points should be at least ten ppm. 
    In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled with the chlorinating agent. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-88; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(9.08), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-179. - Final flushing and testing. 
    Following chlorination, all treated water shall be thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the replacement water, throughout its length shall, upon test, be approved as safe water by the department of public works. This quality of water delivered by the new main should continue for a period of at least two full days as demonstrated by laboratory examination of samples taken from a tap located and installed in such a way as to prevent outside contamination. Samples should never be taken from an unsterilized hose or from a fire hydrant, because such samples seldom meet current bacteriological standards. 
(a)  Repetition of procedures. Should the initial treatment fail to result in the conditions specified, the chlorination procedure shall be repeated until such results are obtained. 
(b)  Sampling tap. Three-quarter-inch bronze corporation cocks shall be installed in all water mains at intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet. 
The contractor must notify the engineering department at least 24 hours in advance to arrange for appropriate pressure testing and water samplings. The contractor is to provide the engineering department with sampling bottles at the time of sampling. All samples will be sent to a State of Illinois approved testing lab for analysis.

Sec. 38-180. - Environmental protection agency. 
    Water main design and construction shall in all respects be in accord with the regulations of the Bureau of Public Water Supply, Environmental Protection Agency, State of Illinois. No construction shall commence until a copy of a permit from this agency is filed with the village or that the village received verification from this agency that a permit has been issued. 
    All water mains must be constructed according to the rules and regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health regarding the protection of water mains, water service lines and appurtenances from contamination.

Sec. 38-201. - General. 
    Except as otherwise provided herein, no residential, commercial or industrial subdivision or development within the corporate limits of the village shall be approved unless it is served by sanitary sewers connected to the village's sewer system. 
    All sanitary sewers which are installed in the public ways or in easements serving a central system, shall be dedicated to the Village of Hanover Park. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-101; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(10.01), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 38-202. - Design. 
(a)  Sewer mains shall be designed according to the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois or according to Recommended Standards for Sewage Works. The more stringent requirements of either shall apply. Sewer mains shall be of adequate size to serve the entire development proposed, and except as otherwise approved by the village engineer, shall be installed in the street right-of-way, or in an easement adjacent thereto. In no case shall mains be installed within ten feet of a building. The minimum size of mains shall be eight-inch internal diameter. Manholes shall be installed not more than 400 feet apart for sewers 15 inches in diameter or less, and 500 feet for sewers 18 inches to 30 inches in diameter. 
    Before commencing the sewer layout, the developer shall confer with the village to determine the required size and grades for any trunk sewers traversing the subdivision to fit the village's available or proposed capacities required for existing or proposed developments both upstream and downstream. Construction required to accommodate the subdivision or development shall be submitted as part of the engineering plans. Sanitary sewers shall be extended to the edge of the development along public rights-of-way and at other points indicated by the village engineer. 
(b)  All sanitary sewers shall be constructed in accord with the provisions of division II and division III of the Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, 1967, as modified and/or more specifically defined in these paragraphs and sections. In case of conflict, the provisions of the following paragraphs shall apply. 
(c)  For pipe depths less than three feet, pipe shall be case iron, ductile iron or thick walled PVC, or vitrified clay of ACP in a concrete cradle or encased in concrete. 
(d)  Type 2 bedding, consisting of at least four inches of clean uniformly graded granular aggregate CA11 or CA13, shall be furnished and placed across the trench bottom under all sewer pipe, except ductile iron and shall completely cover the pipe to a point six inches over the top of the sewer pipe. Material shall be placed and formed as described in ASTM specification C12-64. 
(e)  Sanitary sewer service laterals of a minimum of four inches internal diameter shall be provided for each lot, parcel or tract prior to the construction of street pavements. Services shall extend to the property line. Service connection shall consist of one-eighth sewer pipe bend set in the bell of the eye or tee and the necessary lengths of pipe. 
(f)  If a lift station is part of the engineering design, it shall be shown in plan elevation. Specifications for said lift station shall be submitted with engineering plans. Lift station shall be of the dry well or wet well type, and shall conform in all respects to the standards established by the State of Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and MSD. However, every reasonable effort shall be made to avoid lift station in engineering design. 
    A separate source of power shall be furnished to each sewerage lift station. This shall be from another electrical source provided by a separately powered engine. Engine, enclosure and mounting shall be subject to approval by the village engineer. An alarm shall be installed to the village master panel in the event of failure at the lift station. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-102; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(10.02), 5-21-1981; Ord. No. O-93-13, § 17, 4-1-1993)

(4)  Ductile iron main shall conform to AWWA specification C151-65. 
(5)  Thick walled PVC pipe shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D-224.1 or D-3034, SDR 35 (SDR, or standard dimension ratio, is the ratio of the pipe OD to the minimum wall thickness (SDR = D/t). The structural stability and supporting strength of the pipe decrease with the increase of SDR). The pipe shall not exceed 20 feet in laying length. Installation and selection of bedding material shall conform to the requirements of ASTM specification D-2321. 
(6)  Truss pipe shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D2680-68T. 
(b)  Pipe joints. 
(1)  Rubber gasket joints. On tongue-and-groove type of pipe joints, rubber gaskets may be used. The gasket shall consist of a special rubber ring of a size to fit snugly over the tongue of each size pipe. The gasket shall be circular, elliptical or of the manufacturer's special design cross section fabricated out of a special composition or rubber specifically designed to resist the hardening action of the sulphur compounds in sewage and to prevent disintegration from sewage or water over long periods. 
A ring shall be fitted over the tongue of each pipe to be laid at its outer end. The tongue shall be inserted into the groove of the pipe previously laid and the pipe pulled home. 
Joints shall be made up in strict conformance with the manufacturer's recommendations and directions. Rubber gasket material shall conform to ASTM designation C425, type I or III (O-ring gasket). 
(2)  Sections of cast iron pipe shall be connected by means of slip joints consisting of bells cast integrally with the pipe, which have interior angular recesses conforming with the shape and dimension of a rubber scaling gasket, interior dimension of which is such that it will admit the insertion of the spigot end of the joining pipe in such manner as to compress the gasket tightly between the bell of the pipe and the inserted spigot, thus securing the gasket and sealing the joint. Such slip joints shall be any one of the following make or type or equal: 
a.  Super bellites supplied by James B. Clow and Son. 
b.  Fastite-As supplied by the American Cast Iron Pipe Company. 
c.  Tyton-As supplied by the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company. 
The lubricant used in conjunction with the slip joints shall be that recommended by the suppliers, or commercially processed animal fat or vegetable shortening as approved by the engineer. 
(3)  Thick walled PVC joint. The pipe joint shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D-1869. The joint shall consist of a bell that is an integral part of the pipe, stiffened to securely lock a solid cross sectional rubber ring into position. A "home" mark shall be provided on the spigot end of the pipe. The joint shall be able to withstand an internal hydrostatic pressure of 25 psi for one hour and leakage during that time shall be considered a failure of test and joint. 
(4)  Truss pipe joint. The pipe joint shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D-2680. 
(c)  Pipe sleeves for augering or tunneling. 
(1)  Steel sleeves shall be three-eighths-inch thick of the diameter specified, with a continuous, circular one-half-inch bead weld and shall meet the requirements of ASTM A-120. 
(2)  Concrete sleeves (alternate), if selected in place of the steel sleeves specified above, shall be reinforced concrete pipe, tongue and groove type, conforming to the requirements of ASTM C-76-57, table IV, class designation 3,000D. 
(Code 1975, § 91/2-103; Ord. No. O-81-31, § 1(10.03), 5-21-1981; Ord. No. O-93-13, §§ 18, 19, 4-1-1993) 
Sec. 38-204. - Construction requirements. 
(a)  Excavation and foundation. The trench shall be excavated so that the flow line of the finished sewer shall be at the depth and grade established by the village engineer. The trench for the pipe shall be excavated at least 12 inches wider than the external diameter of the pipe. The width of the trench shall not exceed the external diameter of the pipe by more than 18 inches at the top of the pipe. 
    The pipe foundation shall be bedding material consisting of road gravel or one-quarter-inch to three-quarter-inch crushed stone of the depth shown on the plans. Where pipes with bells or hubs are used, cross trenches shall be excavated to prevent nonuniform loading at the joints. The cross trenches shall not be more than two inches wider than the width of the bell or hub. 
    If the excavation has been made deeper than necessary, the foundation shall be brought to proper grade by the addition of well-compacted bedding material. Where a firm foundation is not encountered at the grade established, due to soft, spongy or other unsuitable soil (unless other special construction methods are called for on the plans or in the special provisions), all such unsuitable soil under the pipe and for the width of the trench shall be removed and replaced with well-compacted bedding material. 
    Where it is necessary to tunnel, the width shall be the same as for trenches. Where sheeting and shoring is necessary, this width shall be between the faces of said sheeting or shoring. The ends of a tunnel shall be at a distance equal to not less than the depth of the trench from the edge of pavements where tunneling is done under pavements. Ends of tunnels under trees, driveways, walks and other obstacles shall be of sufficient distance from them to give ample protection to them. The sides and roof shall be braced sufficiently to support roadways and other obstacles and to prevent caving, bulging and settlement. It is preferred that open trenching be used in all cases under pavements, walks and driveways except where they exist of concrete. Where trenches are dug through pavement, walks and driveways, the contractor shall provide substantial bridges over same so that traffic can be maintained and access to occupied properties is assured. 
    Access must be left to all fire hydrants, valves and to private drives at all times. 
(b)  Sheeting and bracing. Sheeting and bracing shall be placed in the ditch, as may be necessary for the safety of the work and public, for the protection of the workmen, adjacent properties, pavement or structures and for the proper installation of the work. In any event, the minimum protection shall conform to the recommendations in OSHA Safety and Health Standards for Construction. A sand box or trench shield may be used in place of sheeting as permitted by OSHA. When close sheeting is used, it shall be driven so as to prevent adjacent soil from entering the trench either below or through such sheeting. 
    Sheeting and/or bracing shall be progressively removed as the backfill is placed in such a manner as to prevent the caving-in of the sides of the trench or excavation and to prevent damage to the work. 
    Sheeting which is placed for the protection of the public, adjacent properties, pavement or structures, shall not be removed until the backfill has been placed and thoroughly compacted. While being drawn, all vacancies left by this sheeting shall be carefully filled with sand free silt, rammed into place, puddled or otherwise firmly compacted. 
(c)  Dewatering. Dewatering sufficient to maintain the water level at or below the surface of trench bottom or base of the bedding course, shall be accomplished prior to pipe laying and jointing if not prior to excavation and placing of the bedding as called for in other sections of the specifications or special provisions. The dewatering operation, however, accomplished, shall be carried out so that it does not destroy or weaken the strength of the soil under or along side the trench. The normal water table shall be restored to its natural level in such a manner as to not disturb the pipe and its foundation. 
(d)  Pipe laying. The laying of pipes in finished trenches shall be started at the outlet end with the spigot ends pointing in the direction of flow and shall proceed toward the inlet end with pipes abutting and shall be true to line and grade. The ends of the pipes shall be carefully cleaned before the pipes are lowered into the trenches and the pipes shall be lowered in such a manner that unnecessary handling in the trench will be avoided. At each length of pipe is laid, the mouth of the pipe shall be properly protected to prevent the entrance of earth or the bedding material. The pipe shall be fitted and matched so that when laid in the work, they will form a sewer with a smooth, uniform invert. 
    All jointing material shall be used in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer. Each pipe shall be pushed or pulled as tightly as possible to the section in place to insure tight joints. 
    Sewer pipe shall not be dropped from trucks or cars. All pipe must be lowered into the trench with suitable apparatus for this purpose; in no case shall it be dropped or thrown. 
(e)  Connections. Connections of new sewers to existing sewers when encountered in construction shall be made where ordered by the village engineer. Such connections shall be made within a manhole, except for house and drain connections. When connections are made with sewers carrying sewage or water, special care must be taken that no part of the work is built under water; a flume or dam must be installed and pumping maintained if necessary, to keep the new work dry until completed and concrete or mortar has been set up. 
    Junctions for future sewer connections shall be bricked off at the ends, or otherwise sealed off in a manner approved by the village engineer. 
(f)  Wyes. Wyes, for existing or future lateral connection, shall be inserted in the sewer at the appropriate location as required by the village engineer. Wyes shall be constructed so as to be an integral part of the main sewer pipe. Where risers are to be provided, the wye bell shall be placed at the top of the pipe perpendicular to the main sewer flow line. When risers are not required, the wye bell shall be placed midway between the top of the pipe and the horizontal centerline of the pipe at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to 60 degrees, with the upstream face of the pipe. 
    Wyes not put in service at the time of construction (of the sewer) shall be plugged in such a manner as to be watertight and to facilitate future removal without injury to the wye. 
(g)  Backfilling. The contractor shall not backfill sewers above the top of the pipe until the sewer elevations, gradient, alignment and the pipe joints have been made available for checking by the village engineer or his representative. 
    All trenches and excavations shall be backfilled as soon as joints have acquired a suitable degree of hardness. Concrete joints shall be protected to prevent drying and cracking of the joints. 
    All sewer pipe, as soon as laid, shall have the space between the pipe and the bottom and sides of the trench above the pipe foundation packed full with sand or grade 9 gravel by hand and thoroughly tamped with a shovel, hoe or light tamper, as soon as placed, to six inches above the top pipe. The filling shall be carried up evenly on both sides. Care shall be taken that no rock, frozen material or other hard substances are placed in contact with the pipe. In areas where clean fine and dry sand is used for backfill tamping will not be required. 
    The trench shall be backfilled by using the material originally excavated from the ditch (except for conditions hereafter defined) to a height slightly above the original elevation of the ground. Backfilling shall not be left unfinished more than 300 feet behind the completed masonry or pipe work. 
    No heavy rock shall be dropped into the trench nor placed within three feet of the sewer pipe. In depositing rock into the trench, care must be taken that the rock does not injure the structure. 
    All voids existing between the outside of the pipe and the limits of a tunnel excavation or lining shall be filled with sand free of silt thoroughly rammed or flushed into place, or with concrete composed of one part Portland cement, three parts of fine aggregate and five parts of coarse aggregate thoroughly packed into place. 
    Sewers constructed in open cut across any existing or proposed pavements, driveways and sidewalks (where locations are known), and all trenches where the inner edge of the existing or proposed pavement, shall be backfilled with gravel (grade 9), thoroughly flushed and jetted or tamped in nine-inch lifts in place. 
(h)  Completion of work. When the work is completed, all surplus material, earth, rubbish, etc., shall be removed and that portion of the surface of each street disturbed by construction shall be left in as good condition as it was before the commencement of the work and it shall be promptly and regularly maintained in such condition during a period of two years after the final acceptance of the work. This work of maintenance shall apply to the items of materials and workmanship improperly installed in the first instance and maintenance measures made necessary by the ordinary wear and tear occasioned by traffic shall not be at the expense of the contractor.

Sec. 38-205. - Inspection and tests. 
    It shall be the intention of this chapter to secure a sewer system with a minimum amount of infiltration. Maximum allowable infiltration shall be 100 gallons per inch of diameter of sewer per mile per 24-hour day at any time for any section of the system. The joints shall be tight and visible leakage in the joints, or leakage in excess of that specified above, shall be repaired at the contractor's expense by procedures acceptable to the village engineer.

Sec. 38-206. - Sewer services. 
(a)  General. All labor, materials, equipment, services and tools required for the furnishing and installation of sewer services required shall be furnished and installed in compliance with the diameter and length as required in the Village of Hanover Park plumbing ordinances in chapter 74, article III, division 2 of this Code. 
(b)  Material. Sewer services pipe shall consist of clay sewer pipe, thick walled PVC or cast iron pipe. 
(c)  Construction. Sewer services from main or lateral sewers toward the property line shall be constructed as follows: 
    Services shall be laid in as straight a line as possible at a uniform gradient, except a connection at main or lateral sewers. 
    The minimum gradient allowable for sewer services shall be one-quarter inch per foot of length. Where the elevation of the main or lateral sewer permits, within the minimum gradient allowance, the sewer service shall be laid on a gradient such that its terminus shall not be less than three feet below the established grade of the street. A one-eighth-bend pipe fitting shall be used for the first length adjacent to the main or lateral sewer when connections are made to "Y" branches installed in such main or lateral sewers. 
    Terminus of sewer service leads shall be shown on the contract drawings. The ends shall be sealed with a vitrified clay or concrete round disc or equal one inch in thickness and of a diameter equal to the diameter of the bell of the sewer service pipe to be sealed. The stoppers shall be set in the ball end of the sewer service pipe and sealed in place with material of the kind and quality used in pipe joints. Oakum shall be placed around the periphery of the stopper before sealing in place to facilitate removal of the stopper without breaking the bell of the pipe. 
(d)  Records. The contractor shall furnish and place a temporary stake opposite the terminus of each sewer service. During construction of the curb and gutter, the contractor shall mark the location of all sewer and water service lines with an "S" or "W" etched into the curb and gutter as a permanent record of service location.

    Where the slope between adjacent properties is one foot horizontal to one foot vertical, retaining walls or other treatments approved by the village engineer shall be required. 
    Residential developers constructing five or more buildings in a subdivision shall fine grade each lot (front, side and rear yards) to the grades on the approved grading plan. In preparation for either seed or sodding, said fine grading shall be a condition to issuance of occupancy permit. Lots in industrial/commercial subdivisions shall be fine graded at the time each lot is developed. 
    As a condition to the issuance of an individual occupancy permit, the developer will furnish the village engineer with a certificate stating that the finished grades on the lot substantially conform to the approved grading plan. The developer shall guarantee that the individual lot itself, as well as the lot in relation to adjoining lots will drain properly for a period of one year from the issuance of the occupancy permit or from the date of final grading approval, whichever is later, providing that no alterations are made to the finished grading that adversely affect the drainage on the lot. If an individual lot, or a series of adjoining lots does not drain properly, the homeowner or homeowners, shall so notify the village engineer in writing prior to the expiration of the one-year guarantee. The village engineer will investigate the complaint, and if justified, will notify the developer in writing as to the improper grading/drainage. If the corrective work has not been performed prior to the final subdivision inspection, the subdivision security may be used to effectuate the work. 
    All residential lots shall be graded smooth and topped with at least four inches of black dirt after compacting and removal of stumps, trees that cannot be saved, boulders and such.

r.  Village: The Village of Hanover Park, Cook and Du Page Counties, Illinois. 
(3)  Principles and standards. Except as provided below, no plat of subdivision or development shall be approved unless the preliminary plan and/or accompanying materials indicate that measures to be taken to control erosion and sedimentation will be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year frequency or less, and that the following principles will be applicable to all development activities in the area to be subdivided: 
a.  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
b.  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed wherever possible. 
c.  The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
d.  Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins or silt traps or filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development. 
e.  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs and benefits involved. 
f.  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
g.  Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion, and should be protected against erosion and sedimentation during development. 
h.  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development. 
(b)  Engineering requirements. In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, an erosion and sedimentation control plan showing the following, must be submitted: 
(1)  All erosion and sedimentation control measures necessary to meet the objectives of this chapter throughout all phases of construction and permanently after completion of development of the site. 
(2)  Seeding mixtures and rates, types of sod, method of seedbed preparation, expected seeding dates, type and rate of lime and fertilizer application, and kind and quality of mulching for both temporary and permanent vegetative control measures. 
(3)  Provisions for maintenance of control facilities, including easements and estimates of the cost of maintenance. 
(4)  Identification of the person(s) or entity which will have legal responsibility for maintenance of erosion control structures and measures after development is completed. 
(5)  The proposed phasing of development of the site, including stripping and clearing, rough grading and construction, and final grading and landscaping. Phasing should identify the expected date on which clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas and the sequence of clearing, installation of temporary sediment control measures, installation of storm drainage, paving streets and parking areas, and establishment of permanent vegetative cover. 
    These submissions shall be prepared in accordance with the standards and requirements contained in Procedures and Standards for Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Northeastern Illinois, prepared by the Northeastern Illinois Erosion and Sedimentation Control Steering Committee and adopted by the (county) soil and water conservation district, which standards and requirements are hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference. 
    The village engineer may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the information submitted is sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and principles of this chapter.

Sec. 38-344. - Permit fees, subdivision improvements security, escrow monies, guarantees and land development permits. 
    Before formal review and approval by the village engineer of any developments to build within the Village of Hanover Park the developer shall be responsible for the following nonrefundable fees: 
(a)  Land development permit fee. As part of the protective inspections policy of the Village of Hanover Park, a land development permit fee is hereby required for all developments to cover engineering plans review and construction inspections. 
The required permit fee is set at two percent of the cost of the total of "improvements" as defined in this chapter less mass grading and less the cost of parking lot improvements. 
The permit fee consists of one-half percent plans review fee plus 11/2 percent construction inspection fee. This fee applies to all developments and is due upon submission of the developer's engineers' estimate. No review shall be performed until the fee is verified. 
No building permits can be issued for any phase of the development until such time as the village clerk certifies to the village engineer that the aforementioned fees are on deposit with the village. 
(b)  Miscellaneous development permit fee. 
(1)  Parking lot permit fee. 
a.  For commercial or industrial developments with a parking lot 30 spaces or less, the permit fee shall be $250.00 lump sum to cover the engineering plans review and construction inspection for that particular development. This permit fee shall be charged in addition to a land development permit fee. 
b.  For developments with 31 to 1,000 spaces, the permit fee shall be $100.00 plus $5.00 per space. The permit fee consists of $1.25 per space for plans review and $3.75 per space for construction inspection. This permit fee shall be charged in addition to the land development permit fee. 
c.  For developments with greater than 1,000 spaces, the permit fee shall be $100.00 plus $5.00 each for the first 1,000 spaces and $4.50 per space thereafter. The permit fee consists of $0.75 per space for plans review and $3.75 per space for construction inspection. This fee shall be charged in addition to the land development permit fee. 
(2)  Curb cut permit fee. A lump sum fee in the amount of $100.00 shall be required for cutting the curb and gutter on dedicated village streets. 
(3)  Street opening permit fee. A lump sum fee in the amount of $100.00 shall be required for opening a dedicated village street where the final wearing surface has been laid. 
No building permits can be issued for any phase of the development until such time as the village engineer certifies to the director of the building department that the land development permit and/or miscellaneous development permit has been issued. 
(c)  Improvement security. A subdivider or developer, upon approval of the detailed engineering plans by the village engineer, shall submit to the village engineer, for review by the village attorney, and for deposit with the village clerk a good and sufficient security for the completion of all public and private common improvements less mass earth and parking lot improvements in the amount of the estimate of the village engineer of 110 percent of the cost of the installation of such improvements. Said security shall provide that monies in such estimated amounts are on deposit with a bank or other financial institution and restricted for the purpose of the installation and completion of said improvements. 
Such security shall be evidenced by an appropriate instrument which shall provide that no withdrawal or reduction shall be made without the written consent of the village manager and that in the event that said improvements are not completed in accordance with village requirements, the bank or other financial institution shall, upon written demand by the village manager, take any and all necessary steps to provide funds to the extent of such bank's or financial institution's remaining liability on such security for purpose of paying the cost of constructing said improvement. Such instrument shall further provide that no more than 50 percent of the amount deposited may be disbursed until the improvements have been completed and accepted by the village engineer. 
Approval of payments for the installation of improvements shall not constitute acceptance of such improvements. All improvements, except the final wearing surface of any road, to be constructed hereunder, shall be completed within two years of the presentation of such guarantees or further building permits or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued until such guarantees or securities are updated to reflect cost escalations and completion dates. 
Where such improvements are being installed by reason of an approval of unit construction, the said security may be limited to those improvements necessary for the unit being constructed. When the improvements have been accepted for full ownership and maintenance by the village, all obligation for the security set forth herein will be released by the village board provided, however, that the escrow monies referred to in subparagraph (d) must be submitted to the village engineer to be deposited with the village clerk before such release. In the event that the subdivision improvements will not ultimately be accepted by the village, the obligations hereunder will be released when the project or phase is totally completed and an inspection is made by the village to verify the completion of the required improvements in accordance with the village standards and a release letter is authorized by the village manager. 
The requirements for the improvements security set forth herein apply to all types of developments regardless of use or ownership. 
(d)  Escrow monies. A subdivider or developer, before the public improvements have been accepted by the village board, or before the private improvements have been approved by the village board, shall deposit with the Village of Hanover Park in escrow, in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to five percent of the approved engineer's estimate as a guarantee against any defect in the material or workmanship furnished in connection with such improvement latent in character and not discernible at the time of the final acceptance or approval of such improvement and to guarantee against any damage to such improvements by reason of settling of the ground, base or foundation thereof. Such deposit may be applied by the village for any amounts required by the village to correct any such defects arising within any applicable guarantee or warranty period. The balance of such deposit, if any held at the end of 13 months following final acceptance or approval of such improvements, shall be refunded or returned to the depositor or to the order of the depositor. 
(e)  Maintenance bonds. A subdivider or developer, before the public improvements have been accepted by the village board, or private common improvements have been approved by the village board, shall provide to the Village of Hanover Park, a maintenance bond in the amount of ten percent of the approved engineer's estimate for a period of two years. 
(f)  Expiration of securities, etc. Expiration of any securities, escrow monies, guarantees, warranties, bonds or letters of credit, as defined in the chapter shall not expire during the months of November, December, January, February, March or April. 
(g)  Land development permit. Construction, including earthwork, underground and surface improvements cannot begin until this permit has been issued.

DIVISION 4. - AIR POLLUTION EMISSION STANDARDS 

Sec. 54-251. - Purposes. 
(a)  Air quality standards are ambient air quality goals established for the purpose of protecting public health and welfare. The levels of air quality designated by the standards are designed to protect against injury to human, plant or animal life; they are further intended to allow maximum enjoyment of property consistent with the intent of this article. 
(b)  The first use of air resources is to sustain life. Air entering the respiratory tract must not menace health. Therefore, the air quality standards set must, as a minimum, provide air which will not adversely affect, through acute or chronic symptoms, the health of the community. 
(c)  The air quality standards set here will provide a basis for planning to achieve cleaner air. Even though in certain areas of the village the quality of the air may be lower than the standards, they are not a license allowing unnecessary degradation of the air, going against the intent of this article, which requires a maintenance of the purity of the air resources of the state. 
(d)  The standards have also been designed for use as a basis for the development of implementation plans for the abatement and control of pollutants emissions from existing sources, including development of air contaminant emission limitations and the setting of long range and short range objectives for reduction of total emission of air contaminates as determined by emission inventories. They will be used in the determination of air pollution control emission limitations for future installations to insure that urban and economic growth trends do not add to community air pollution problems.

(1)  A licensee or an employee of a licensee has provided false information or any application for a license or renewal of a license required by this article; 
(2)  A licensee is convicted of the commission of any misdemeanor or felony specified in section 58-875(c)(7)a; or 
(3)  A licensee, or an employee of the licensee, has committed a violation of any provision of section 58-876 or section 58-877; or 
(4)  A licensee, or an employee of the licensee, has knowingly permitted gambling by any person on the sexually oriented business premises. 
(Ord. No. O-99-15, art. I, § 16.1-9, 3-4-1999) 
Sec. 58-880. - Revocation of license. 
(a)  The clerk shall request the village legal department to seek an order of court of competent jurisdiction to revoke a license if a cause of suspension in section 58-879 occurs and the license has previously been suspended within the preceding 12 months. 
(b)  The clerk shall seek to revoke a license if the clerk determines that: 
(1)  A licensee gave false or misleading information in the material submitted to the village during the application process. 
(2)  A licensee or an employee has knowingly allowed possession, use, or sale of controlled substances on the premises. 
(3)  A licensee or an employee has knowingly allowed prostitution on the premises. 
(4)  A licensee or an employee knowingly operated the sexually oriented business during a period of time when the licensee's license was suspended or expired. 
(5)  A licensee has been convicted of an offense listed in section 58-875(c)(7)a for which the time period required in section 58-875(c)(7)b has not elapsed. 
(6)  On two or more occasions within a 12-month period, a person or persons committed an offense occurring in or on the licensed premises of a crime listed in section 58-875(c)(7)a, for which a conviction has been obtained, and the person or persons were employees of the sexually oriented business at the time the offenses were committed. 
(7)  A licensee or an employee has knowingly allowed any act of sexual intercourse, sodomy, oral copulation or masturbation to occur in or on the licensed premises. 
(c)  The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the revocation of the license.

If, subsequent to revocation, the clerk finds that the basis for the revocation has been corrected or abated, the applicant may be granted a license if at least 90 days have elapsed since the date the revocation became effective. If the license was revoked under subsection 58-880(b)(5), an applicant may not be granted another license until the appropriate number of years required under section 58-875(c)(7)b has elapsed since the termination of any sentence, parole, or probation.

(a)  Appeal of decision of clerk. 
(1)  If the clerk denies the issuance of a license, or the reissuance of a license, the clerk shall send to the applicant, or licensee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notice of such decision and the right of the applicant or licensee to appeal said decision to the village manager. Notice of denial shall be mailed within five business days after the clerk has made such decision. 
(2)  The aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the clerk to the village manager by filing a written notice of appeal within five business days after the receipt of the decision of the clerk. If the cause(s) of the denial of the application for renewal of a license does not constitute immediate danger to the public health, welfare or safety, the filing of an appeal with the village manager stays the decision of the clerk in regard to an existing sexually oriented business until the village manager makes a final decision on the appeal. The village manager shall issue a final decision on the appeal no later than ten business days after the notice of appeal has been filed with the village manager. 
(b)  Appeal of decision of village manager. 
(1)  All the final decisions of the village manager under this article shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.), and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. 
(2)  If the cause of the denial of the renewal of a license for a sexually oriented business does not constitute immediate danger to the public health, welfare or safety, the filing of an appeal from the final decision of the village manager stays the action of the clerk in denying the reissuance of a license. 
(Ord. No. O-99-15, art. I, § 16.1-11, 3-4-1999) 
Sec. 58-882. - Transfer of license prohibited. 
    No sexually oriented business license shall be sold, transferred, or assigned by any license holder, or by operation of law, to any other person, group, partnership, corporation or any other entity, and any such sale, transfer or assignment, or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment, shall be deemed to constitute a voluntary surrender of such license, and such license shall be thereafter null and void. A sexually oriented business license held by an individual or corporation, a partnership or by any other form of business entity is subject to the same prohibition of transferability as contained above. Any change in the nature of the licensed sexually oriented business from one type of sexually oriented business use to another type of sexually oriented business use shall also render the license null and void. A sexually oriented business license shall be valid only for the exact location specified in the license.

(b)  A person commits an offense if he causes or permits the operation, establishment, or maintenance of more than one sexually oriented business in the same building, structure, or portion thereof, or the increase of floor area of any sexually oriented business in any building, structure, or portion thereof. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to the intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building or structure used as a part of the premises where a sexually oriented business is conducted, to the closest exterior wall of the structure which is the proposed location for another sexually oriented business. 
(Ord. No. O-99-15, art. I, § 16.1-13, 3-4-1999)

(c)  That portion of the public right-of-way to be used by the block party or gathering shall be closed to vehicular traffic by an appropriate number of barricades provided by the village.

(4)  Reserved. 
(5)  Reserved. 
(c)  Notice. Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police officer shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility authorized by the village. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle and of owner's right to request a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section. Said vehicle shall be impounded pending the completion of the hearings provided for in subsection (d) herein, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00 and pays the towing and storage charges. 
(d)  Preliminary hearing. If the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section desires to appeal the seizure, said owner must make a request for said hearing within 24 hours of the seizure. Said request shall be in writing and filed with the chief of police or his designee who shall conduct such preliminary hearing within 24 hours after receipt of the request excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or village holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably-prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the chief of police or his designee determines there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, he shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section, unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00, and pays the tower any applicable towing and storage fees. If the chief of police or his designee determines that there is no such probable cause, the vehicle will be returned without penalty or other fees. 
(e)  Hearing. Within ten days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the village shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time, and location of a plea hearing that will be conducted, pursuant to this section. The owner will appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If a plea of guilty is entered, the case will be disposed of at that time. If the owner pleads not guilty, a final hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than 45 days after the vehicle was seized. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably-prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used in connection with a violation set forth in this section, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly liable to the village for an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed $500.00 and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner pays the administrative penalty to the village plus fees to the tower for the towing and storage of the vehicle. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village. If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees. 
(f)  Administrative penalty. If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the village. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the penalty is paid to the village and any applicable towing and storage fees, are paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after an administrative penalty is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the village, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code. 
(g)  Vehicle possession. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the administrative penalty and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. 
(2)  For purposes of this section, the "owner of record" of a vehicle is the record title holder as registered with the secretary of state, State of Illinois.

(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-003. - Notice of violation. 
    When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of section 62-19-002, the village shall issue a written notice of violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by first class mail, postage prepaid, within 30 days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than 90 days following the violation. The village shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within 60 days of the notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided within 60 days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class mail postage prepaid. 
    A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of section 62-19-002, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in section 62-19-004 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this article. 
    The notice of violation shall include the following information: 
(a)  The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database; 
(b)  The registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation; 
(c)  The violation charged with specific references to the section allegedly violated; 
(d)  The location where the violation occurred;

(h)  A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or lessee; 
(i)  The amount of the late fee; 
(j)  A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle; 
(k)  A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation; 
(l)  A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine or challenging the charge in an administrative hearing; and 
(m)  A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested.

Sec. 62-19-004. - Defenses. 
    The following shall be the only defenses available for an alleged violator contesting liability for a violation of a red light signal, which shall be weighed by the hearing office and shall only rebut the prima facie case established by the notice of violation insofar as one or more of the following defenses are established by a preponderance of the evidence: 
(a)  The motor vehicle and/or registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the exclusive control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the red light signal violation, which defense may be demonstrated through the submission of a certified copy of a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates filed with a law enforcement agency prior to the time of the alleged violation; 
(b)  The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection in spite of a red light either to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, or as part of a funeral procession; and 
(c)  The driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection in spite of a red light at the direction of a police officer acting within the scope of his duties; or 
(d)  The operator of the vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Violation from a police officer, which citation is determined to be a moving violation reportable to the Illinois Secretary of State. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-005. - Hearing. 
    The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of section 62-19-002 may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of violation (21 days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of section 62-19-002. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in section 62-19-004. 
    The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding of liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "Findings, Decision, and Order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to pay the amount by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-006. - Nonresident. 
    Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle is not a resident of the village but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged violation, such person may contest the charges using the same available defenses as stated above, but rather than attend the administrative hearing, they may submit any and all documentary evidence to the traffic compliance administrator no later than the hearing date, together with a written statement reflecting that they are nonresidents of the village. The traffic compliance administrator shall forward all timely-submitted materials to the hearing officer for review and determination.

Any penalty imposed for a violation of this section is a civil penalty and is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of motor vehicles and shall not be transmitted to the Illinois Secretary of State to be recorded on the driving record of the vehicle owner. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-008. - Final determination. 
    A final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to pay the fine, a failure to request a hearing by the respond-by date, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by the Municipal Code of Hanover Park. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination shall become final upon a failure to pay the amount owed on the date provided in the "Findings, Decision, and Order" letter. Appeal may be made to the Circuit Court of Cook County on any final determination as provided for by the Administrative Review Act. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008)

The notice will also state that the owner can petition the village to set aside the determination of liability before it becomes final. If the owner does not pay the $100.00 as specified in the notice or petition the village to set aside the determination, within 21 days, a notice of final determination will be sent to the owner indicating that the owner has exhausted all challenge options and the $100.00 fine is a debt due and owing to the village and must be paid within 14 days. The owner will also be notified that the failure to pay the $100.00 fine within 14 days will result in a late fee of $100.00 added to the original fine. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-010. - Notice of final determination. 
    A notice of final determination shall be sent following the final determination of automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review. The notice of final determination shall include the following information: 
(1)  A statement that the unpaid fine is a debt due and owing to the village; and 
(2)  A warning that a failure to pay any fine due and owing to the village within 14 days may result in a petition to the Circuit Court of Cook County to have the unpaid fine rendered as a judgment or may result in the suspension of the person's drivers license for failure to pay fines or penalties for five or more violations under this article. 
(Ord. No. O-08-48, § 1, 8-7-2008) 
Sec. 62-19-011. - Petitions to set aside determination.

Sec. 62-19-013. - Drivers license suspension. 
    The traffic compliance administrator, by certified report, may request that the Secretary of State suspend the driving privileges of an owner of a registered vehicle who has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of five automated traffic violations. The report shall be certified and contain the following: 
(a)  The name, last known address as recorded with the Secretary of State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or as recorded in a United States post office-approved database if any notice sent under this article is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;

A certified copy of such notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein. 
Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that their driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the traffic compliance administrator. The person shall, within seven days after having received notice form the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak with the traffic compliance administrator to challenge the accuracy of the certified report. If the traffic compliance administrator determines that the original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has already paid their fine for the five or more automated traffic violations, the traffic compliance administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of State of such error in a subsequent certified report.

(b)  "Obscene" defined. A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest; that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters. A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of undeveloped photographs. 
(c)  Interpretation of evidence. Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience. 
    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is utterly without redeeming social importance. 
    In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
(1)  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
(2)  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
(3)  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or the absence thereof; 
(4)  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
(5)  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material; 
(6)  Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or disseminator. 
(d)  Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three copies of obscene material, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(e)  Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under 18 years of age; 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.

Sec. 66-31. - Parental responsibility. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms specified have the meanings ascribed to them: 
(1)  Legal guardian means a person appointed guardian, or given custody, of a minor by a circuit court of this state, but does not include a person appointed guardian or given custody of a minor under the Juvenile Court Act (705 ILCS 405/1-1 et seq.), as amended. 
(2)  Minor means a person who is under 18 years of age. 
(3)  Delinquent acts means those acts which violate the statutes of the State of Illinois or the ordinances of the village or those acts which would cause or tend to cause a minor to come under the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court Act (705 ILCS 405/1-1 et seq.), as amended, but shall not include violations of the Hanover Park Vehicle Code or similar violations of the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/1-100 et seq.), as amended. 
(b)  It shall be the continuous duty of the parent or legal guardian of any minor to exercise reasonable control to prevent the minor from committing any delinquent act. The parent or legal guardian of an unemancipated minor residing with such parent or legal guardian shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have failed to exercise proper parental responsibility and said minor shall be deemed to have committed a delinquent act with the knowledge and permission of the parent or legal guardian in violation of this section, upon the concurrence of the events described in (1), (2) and (3) below: 
(1)  An unemancipated minor residing with a parent or legal guardian who shall be adjudicated to have committed a delinquent act or shall have incurred nonjudicial sanctions from another official agency resulting in an admission of guilt of having committed a delinquent act; 
(2)  Said parent or legal guardian shall have received a written notice thereof, either by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service with a certificate of personal service returned, from the police department of the village following said adjudication or nonjudicial sanction; and 
(3)  If, at any time within one year following the receipt of the notice set forth in (2) above, said minor is adjudicated to have committed a delinquent act or shall have incurred nonjudicial sanctions from another official agency resulting from an admission of guilt of committing a delinquent act. 
(c)  Any parent, legal guardian or other person commits improper supervision of a minor when he knowingly permits a minor in his custody or control under the age of 18 years to associate with known thieves, burglars, felons, narcotic addicts or other persons of ill repute, visit a place of prostitution, commit a lewd act, commit an act tending to break the peace or violate the curfew ordinance. 
(d)  The parent of an unemancipated minor is liable for actual damages for the willful or malicious acts of the minor which cause injury or loss to the property of the public or any person. 
(e)  A minor shall be deemed to have committed the offense or offenses enumerated in this chapter with the knowledge, consent, acquiescence and permission of the parent. 
(f)  The parent shall be liable for restitution or reparation in an amount equal to the actual loss or damage to the property or for the pecuniary reimbursement imposed by a court upon the minor defendant for violation of this section. When the court orders restitution or reparation, the court shall determine the amount of and conditions for payment. If the parties have not agreed on the amount of damages, the judge shall conduct a separate hearing on that issue. The measure of liability shall be the cost of repairing partially damaged property or the depreciated replacement cost of repairing partially damaged property or the depreciated replacement cost of the property that is damaged beyond repair. The amount of the actual loss or damage shall be presumed to be that amount represented by the lower of not less than two bona fide itemized estimates of the damages incurred or by an actual bill for repair or replacement presented by the victim. The defendant shall then have an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the cost set forth in the documents. If the conditions of payment are not satisfied, the court may, upon the motion of the village and within the limits set forth in this subparagraph impose such additional penalties as it deems appropriate. In cases of actual or pecuniary loss or damage to public property, the court, on petition of the village, may in its judgment and absolute discretion, in addition to or in lieu of any restitution, reparation or fine, direct that any minor found guilty perform appropriate and reasonable services to or for any public entity. 
(g)  No parent of a minor shall be held liable for damages as provided for in this section unless he or she is made a party defendant in the proceeding in which the order against the parent is entered. A parent or legal guardian shall be made a party defendant by having received a written notice setting forth the charges against the minor either served personally or by certified mail.

    No continuances shall be authorized by the hearing officer in proceedings under this article except in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the owner. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance authorized by a hearing officer under this article shall not exceed 25 days. 
    At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence including police reports shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonable, prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.

(b)  Commencement of action, burden of proof. 
(1)  In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance property, the village shall have the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(2)  It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a chronic nuisance property that the owner of the property, at the time in question, could not, in the exercise of reasonable care of diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that the property is a chronic nuisance property. 
(3)  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may consider any of the following factors if they are found appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable: 
a.  The actions or lack of action taken by the person in charge to mitigate or correct the problem at the property. 
b.  Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous. 
c.  The magnitude or gravity of the problem. 
d.  The cooperation of the person in charge with the village. 
e.  The cost of the village investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(c)  Remedy. 
(1)  In the event a court determines a property to be a chronic nuisance property, the court may order that the property be closed and secured against all use and occupancy for a period of not less than 30 days, but not more than 180 days or the court may employ any other remedy deemed by it appropriate to abate the nuisance. 
(2)  In addition to the remedy provided in paragraph (1) above, the court may impose upon the owner of the property a civil penalty in the amount of not less than $750.00 per day, payable to the Village of Hanover Park, for each day the owner had actual knowledge that the property was a public nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a public nuisance property. 
(3)  In determining what remedy or remedies to employ, the court may consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the property, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The disturbance of neighbors. 
b.  The occurrence of other nuisances on or from the property. 
c.  The property's general reputation and/or the reputation of persons in or frequenting the property. 
(4)  The court may authorize the village to physically secure the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the village is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the village to affect the closure shall be made and assessed as a lien again the property and debt to the village. As used herein, "costs" mean those costs actually incurred by the village for the physical securing of the property. 
(5)  The village building department employee affecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs, and the village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review. If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property. 
(6)  Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the village.

If, upon reinspection, the code official finds that the licensed property in connection with which the notice was issued is now in compliance with this chapter, including the payment of all outstanding fees, the code official may reinstate the license. The request for a reinspection shall not stay the revocation of the license unless the code official grants such request pursuant to a showing of good cause by the property owner.

(Ord. No. O-07-32, § 2, 11-1-07) 
Sec. 86-216. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the village authorizes a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on village rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Duration. No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than six months unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion. 
(c)  Pre-construction meeting required. No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners. 
(d)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(Ord. No. O-07-32, § 2, 11-1-07) 
Sec. 86-217. - Revised permit drawings. 
    In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within 90 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with section 86-231 of this article. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. 
(Ord. No. O-07-32, § 2, 11-1-07) 
Sec. 86-218. - Insurance. 
(a)  Required coverages and limits. Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility as named insured and naming the village, and its elected and appointed officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the policies listed in subsections (1) and (2) below: 
(1)  Commercial general liability insurance, including premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly referred to as "X," "C," and "U" coverages) and products-completed operations coverage with limits not less than:

(4)  Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 per employee and per accident. 
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section. 
(b)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(c)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the village within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the village. 
(d)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement: 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of such intent to cancel or not to renew." 
Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. 
(e)  Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a), or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(f)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(g)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be affected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State of Illinois. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

(Ord. No. O-07-32, § 2, 11-1-07) 
Sec. 86-220. - Security. 
(a)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village engineer, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village engineer may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

b.  The location where each proposed small wireless facility or utility pole would be installed and photographs of the location and its immediate surroundings depicting the utility poles or structures on which each proposed small wireless facility would be mounted or location where utility poles or structures would be installed. This should include a depiction of the completed facility; 
c.  Specifications and drawings prepared by a structural engineer, as that term is defined in Section 4 of the Structural Engineering Practice Act of 1989, for each proposed small wireless facility covered by the application as it is proposed to be installed; 
d.  The equipment type and model numbers for the antennas and all other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility; 
e.  A proposed schedule for the installation and completion of each small wireless facility covered by the application, if approved; and 
f.  Certification that the collocation complies with the collocation requirements and conditions contained herein, to the best of the applicant's knowledge. 
g.  In the event that the proposed small wireless facility is to be attached to an existing pole owned by an entity other than the village, the wireless provider shall provide legally competent evidence of the consent of the owner of such pole to the proposed collocation. 
(2)  Application process. The village shall process applications as follows: 
a.  The first completed application shall have priority over applications received by different applicants for collocation on the same utility pole or wireless support structure. 
b.  An application to collocate a small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, or replacement of an existing utility pole or wireless support structure shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall be deemed approved if the village fails to approve or deny the application within 90 days after the submission of a completed application. 
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 75 days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 90th day after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
c.  An application to collocate a small wireless facility that includes the installation of a new utility pole shall be processed on a nondiscriminatory basis and deemed approved if the village fails to approve or deny the application within 120 days after the submission of a completed application. 
However, if an applicant intends to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, the applicant shall notify the village in writing of its intention to invoke the deemed approved remedy no sooner than 105 days after the submission of a completed application. 
The permit shall be deemed approved on the latter of the 120th day after submission of the complete application or the 10th day after the receipt of the deemed approved notice by the village. The receipt of the deemed approved notice shall not preclude the village's denial of the permit request within the time limits as provided under this article. 
d.  The village shall deny an application which does not meet the requirements of this article. 
If the village determines that applicable codes, ordinances or regulations that concern public safety, or the collocation requirements and conditions contained herein require that the utility pole or wireless support structure be replaced before the requested collocation, approval shall be conditioned on the replacement of the utility pole or wireless support structure at the cost of the provider. 
The village shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the village denies an application. 
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the village and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The village shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the applicant to submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the village's review period. 
The applicant must notify the village in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
e.  Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement, provided by the village for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the application. For subsequent approved permits to collocate on a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the village and the applicant shall enter into a license supplement of the master pole attachment agreement. 
(3)  Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the village shall determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the village must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed complete if the village fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the village's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the village. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the village sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(4)  Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
a.  An express written agreement by both the applicant and the village; or 
b.  A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(5)  Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the Village may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The village may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(6)  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the village makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable village codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable village code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7)  Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information and notices to the village by personal delivery at the village's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail. 
(c)  Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1)  Public safety space reservation. The village may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the village's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the village reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on village utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the village utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a village ordinance, written policy adopted by the village, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variation in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the village's comprehensive zoning ordinance, chapter 110 hereof. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(d)  Application fees. Application fees are imposed as follows: 
(1)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $650.00 for an application to collocate a single small wireless facility on an existing utility pole or wireless support structure, and $350.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in a consolidated application to collocate more than one small wireless facility on existing utility poles or wireless support structures. 
(2)  Applicant shall pay an application fee of $1,000.00 for each small wireless facility addressed in an application that includes the installation of a new utility pole for such collocation. 
(3)  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law or local ordinance, applications pursuant to this section shall be accompanied by the required application fee. Application fees shall be non-refundable. 
(4)  The village shall not require an application, approval or permit, or require any fees or other charges, from a communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way, for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar, the same size, or smaller if the wireless provider notifies the village at least ten days prior to the planned replacement and includes equipment specifications for the replacement of equipment consistent with subsection d. under the section titled application requirements; or 
c.  The installation, placement, maintenance, operation or replacement of micro wireless facilities suspended on cables that are strung between existing utility poles in compliance with applicable safety codes. 
(5)  Wireless providers shall secure a permit from the village to work within rights-of-way for activities that affect traffic patterns or require lane closures. 
(e)  Exceptions to applicability. Nothing in this article authorizes a person to collocate small wireless facilities on: 
(1)  Property owned by a private party or property owned or controlled by the Village or another unit of local government that is not located within rights-of-way, or a privately owned utility pole or wireless support structure without the consent of the property owner; 
(2)  Property owned, leased, or controlled by a park district, forest preserve district, or conservation district for public park, recreation or conservation purposes without the consent of the affected district, excluding the placement of facilities on rights-of-way located in an affected district that are under the jurisdiction and control of a different unit of local government as provided by the Illinois Highway Code; or 
(3)  Property owned by a rail carrier registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, Metra Commuter Rail or any other public commuter rail service, or an electric utility as defined in Section 16-102 of the Public Utilities Act, without the consent of the rail carrier, public commuter rail service, or electric utility. The provisions of this Article do not apply to an electric or gas public utility or such utility's wireless facilities if the facilities are being used, developed and maintained consistent with the provisions of subsection (i) of Section 16-108.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 
For the purposes of this subsection, "public utility" has the meaning given to that term in Section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act. Nothing in this article shall be construed to relieve any person from any requirement (a) to obtain a franchise or a state-issued authorization to offer cable service or video service or (b) to obtain any required permission to install, place, maintain, or operate communications facilities, other than small wireless facilities subject to this article. 
(f)  Pre-existing agreements. Existing agreements between the village and wireless providers that relate to the collocation of small wireless facilities in the right-of-way, including the collocation of small wireless facilities on village utility poles, that are in effect on June 1, 2018, remain in effect for all small wireless facilities collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before June 1, 2018, subject to applicable termination provisions contained therein.

The existing agreement remains in effect, subject to applicable termination provisions, for the small wireless facilities the wireless provider has collocated on the village's utility poles pursuant to applications submitted to the village before the wireless provider provides such notice and exercises its option under this paragraph. 
(g)  Annual recurring rate. A wireless provider shall pay to the village an annual recurring rate to collocate a small wireless facility on a village utility pole located in a right-of-way that equals (i) $200.00 per year or (ii) the actual, direct and reasonable costs related to the wireless provider's use of space on the village utility pole. 
    If the village has not billed the wireless provider actual and direct costs, the fee shall be $200.00 payable on the first day after the first annual anniversary of the issuance of the permit or notice of intent to collocate, and on each annual anniversary date thereafter. 
(h)  Abandonment. A small wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned. The owner of the facility shall remove the small wireless facility within 90 days after receipt of written notice from the village notifying the wireless provider of the abandonment. 
    The notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the village to the owner at the last known address of the wireless provider. If the small wireless facility is not removed within 90 days of such notice, the village may remove or cause the removal of such facility pursuant to the terms of its pole attachment agreement for municipal utility poles or through whatever actions are provided for abatement of nuisances or by other law for removal and cost recovery. 
    A wireless provider shall provide written notice to the village if it sells or transfers small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the village. Such notice shall include the name and contact information of the new wireless provider.

(i)  To facilitate adequate provision for transportation, water, sewerage, schools and other public necessities. 
(j)  To ensure proper legal description and proper monumenting of subdivided land. 
    The regulations are established with reasonable consideration of the character of the village with a view toward conserving the value of buildings upon the land and providing the best possible environment for human habitation. It is intended that these regulations shall supplement and facilitate the enforcement of the provisions and development standards contained in the building code, official map regulations, zoning ordinance, and the official village comprehensive plan and the engineering standards and specifications. 
(Code 1975, § 23-2; Ord. No. O-81-30, § 2(2.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 90-3. - Jurisdiction. 
    The subdivision ordinance of the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois, shall apply to all subdivisions of land, as defined herein, located within the Village of Hanover Park and entirely or in part within the unincorporated area within 11/2 miles of the corporate limits of the village, in accordance with chapter 65 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes (65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.), as amended. The subdivision plans and plats, including planned developments, proposed improvements to be installed, and all procedures relating thereto, shall in all respects be in full compliance with the regulations herein. 
(Code 1975, § 23-3; Ord. No. O-81-30, § 2(3.00), 5-21-1981) 
Sec. 90-4. - General provisions. 
(a)  Wherever any subdivision of land shall hereafter be laid out within the incorporated limits of the Village of Hanover Park, or within contiguous territory not more than 11/2 miles beyond the incorporated boundaries of the Village of Hanover Park, the subdivider thereof or his agent shall submit both a preliminary plan and a final subdivision plat to the Village of Hanover Park for its approval. The subdivision plats and all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance with these regulations. 
(b)  Until preliminary plans and plats for the subdivision are approved: 
(1)  No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any improvements made to the natural land. 
(2)  No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be sold. 
(3)  No improvements-such as sidewalks, water supply, stormwater drainage, sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service, lighting, grading, paving or surfacing of streets-shall hereafter be made by any owner or owners or his or their agent. 
(c)  No land shall be subdivided for any use which is determined by the development commission after investigation by the village engineer to be located within areas of special flood hazard until the subdivider has complied with the Village of Hanover Park, Illinois, Engineering Standards and Specifications, chapter 38, article III. 
(d)  No land shall be subdivided for any use which is determined by the development commission after investigation by the village engineer, to be unsuitable for such a use by reason of flooding or bad drainage, adverse earth and rock formation or topography, or any other features likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of the future residents in the proposed subdivision or of the community. 
    Unsuitable land located within areas of special flood hazard as identified in chapter 38, Engineering Standards and Specifications, article III, shall be subject to the provisions of that chapter and article. 
    Unsuitable land located outside areas of special flood hazard may be subdivided only if the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in accordance with chapter 38, Engineering Standards and Specifications, make the area safe for occupancy and provide adequate lot and street drainage and stormwater detention facilities. 
(e)  Where the developer or subdivider of land outside areas of special flood hazard can show in writing and with appropriate documentation that the strict adherence to the design standards set forth causes an unnecessary hardship, the village board may approve a variance. Such variance may be granted after recommendation by the development commission and where topography and conditions peculiar to the site or surrounding area substantiates a variance without destroying the intent of the provisions of this chapter. 
    Variances for land within areas of special flood hazard shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 38, Engineering Standards and Specifications, article III. 
(f)  All offerings or dedications of land to the village for use as streets, highways, alleys, schools, parks, playgrounds or other public uses shall be referred to the development commission for review and recommendation before being accepted by the village board. 
(g)  Where a tract of land proposed for subdivision is part of a larger subdivision unit in relation to the village as a whole, the development commission may, before recommending approval, request that the subdivider, if he owns such larger tract, submit a plan for the entire area or neighborhood to be used by the development commission as an aid in judging the proposed plat. 
(h)  The village's engineering standards and specifications (chapter 38) shall be the basis for all engineering determinations to be made pursuant to the provisions of these regulations. 
(Code 1975, § 23-4; Ord. No. O-81-30, § 2(4.00), 5-21-1981; Ord. No. O-95-02, § 20, 1-5-1995)

(a)  Minimum standards established. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Higher standards govern. Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this chapter upon the subdivision of land are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
(c)  Easements or covenants not abrogated. This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this chapter are more restrictive or impose higher standards or regulations than such easement, covenant or other private agreement, the requirements of this chapter shall govern. 
(d)  Existing subdivisions. No subdivision of land, which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of this chapter; and to the extent that said subdivision of land is in conflict in any manner with the requirements of this chapter, said subdivision of land remains unlawful hereunder.

The village board may, when it deems it necessary for the health, safety or welfare of the present and future population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities, prohibit subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the floodplain of any stream or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading or dumping of earth, waste material or stumps. Refer to the Engineering Standards and Specifications, chapter 38, article III. 
(2)  Park and playground sites. Refer to section 90-97. 
(c)  Acquisition of land for public use. The development commission shall consider all preliminary plans and adopted or proposed studies related thereto to determine the need for acquisition for public use of any of the land included in the preliminary plan. Land may be acquired for: parks, playgrounds, or other public recreation areas, or other public purposes as provided by law. 
(1)  Referral to public body. The development commission shall refer the plan to the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration and report. The development commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and shall allow the public body or agency 30 days for reply. The agency's recommendation, shall include a map showing the boundaries and area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to complete the acquisition. 
(2)  Notice to property owner. Upon receipt of an affirmative report from an acquiring agency the development commission shall notify the property owner and shall designate on the preliminary plan and final plat that area proposed to be acquired by the public body. 
(3)  Duration of land reservation. The acquisition of land reserved by a public agency on the preliminary plan for final plat shall be initiated within 12 months of the date of the village board's approval of the final plat. 
Such letter of intent shall be accompanied by a sketch plan of the proposed development and a tentative schedule of construction. Failure on the part of the public agency to initiate acquisition within the prescribed 12 months shall result in the removal of the "reserved" designation from the property involved and the freeing of the property for private development. 
(Code 1975, § 23-36; Ord. No. O-81-30, § 2(7.06), 5-21-1981; Ord. No. O-95-02, § 20, 1-5-1995) 
Sec. 90-97. - Dedication of park and school sites or for payments of fees in lieu of. 
    As a condition of approval of either a final plat of a residential subdivision or a final plat of a planned unit development (with a residential component), each subdivider or developer shall be required to (a) dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and school sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision or PUD, or, in certain circumstances, as set forth below, make a cash donation in lieu of a land dedication, and (b) make a cash contribution to serve the immediate and future school needs of the residents of the proposed subdivision or PUD, each of the foregoing requirements to be satisfied in accordance with the criteria and formulas set forth hereinafter. 
_____ 
(a)  Criteria for requiring park and recreation land dedication: 
(1)  Requirements and population ratio. The ultimate density of proposed development shall relate directly to the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be 5.5 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population in accordance with the following classifications: 
Types of Recreation Area Size Range Minimum Acres/1,000 People a. Play lot 8,000 square feet NA b. School/park neighborhood playground 5 acres 1.25 c. Neighborhood park 3.5 acres 1.00 d. District-wide park or playfield 4-30 acres 1.25 e. Community-wide recreation park 12-30 acres 2.00 Total 5.50  
_____ 
(2)  Location. The official comprehensive plan or the Hanover Park District Plan shall be used as guidelines in locating sites. A park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five acres shall be considered a minimum. A central location which will equally serve the entire development is most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
(3)  Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreation services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned developments may at the option of the village board be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of the same shall be determined by the village board, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land requirements for the general area. 
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities and equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, shall be approved by the village, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer shall guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total parkland dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(4)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park sites. Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park purposes, the village board shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required. 
The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the village or other public body designated by the village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as herein before classified which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs. 
a.  Fair market value. The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value as determined by an appraisal by a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI) of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and certified by the State of Illinois of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation sites. The subdivider or developer shall submit an MAI appraisal at the developer's expense showing the "fair market value" of the land upon the final plat of subdivision thereof being recorded. The final determination of said fair market value per acre of such subdivided land shall be made by the village board based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other similar appraisals which may be submitted to the village board by the park district or others. 
b.  Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations in subdivisions or planned developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
1.  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location of a park site. That portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be a dedicated site as required by this section, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have to be dedicated. 
2.  A major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
(5)  Reservation of additional land. Where the comprehensive plan of Hanover Park or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites and particular subdivision or planned development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village, provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
(6)  Combining with adjoining developments. Where the subdivision or planned development is less than 40 acres, public open spaces or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to assembly usable recreation areas or school sites without hardship on a particular developer. 
(7)  Topography and grading. The entire site shall be graded to provide adequate stormwater runoff to insure usable land, a minimum surface grade of two percent shall be maintained; if this cannot be provided, underground drainage shall be installed. 
A minimum of four inches of topsoil shall be provided and fine graded, seeded and fertilized to provide turf area preparatory for recreational facilities by the park district or the school district. If specifically required by the village engineer, adequate clay seals with overlaying topsoil shall be placed upon exposed peat areas within the site. 
(8)  Improved sites. All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water, sewer and streets (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provisions made therefor. The term "improved site" means that the dedicated site shall be deeded to the park district or school district, upon completion of the following items: 
a.  Fine grading and seeding of site. 
b.  Drainage from adjacent private property shall not create unusual and difficult maintenance problems, therefore positive drainage shall be provided around the perimeter of the property. 
(9)  Access into site. 
a.  Direct access from public rights-of-way shall be provided as listed in the following table: 
_____ 
Park Area Size (Total) Number of Access Points Width of Each Access 0 to 5 acres 2 60'0? 5 to 15 acres 3 60'0? 12 to 25 acres 3 Total length 250'0?  
_____ 
b.  Over 25 acres may require additional footage which may be recommended by the development commission and approved by the village board. 
c.  Where a new development adjoins an existing park site, the developer shall provide access to the park. Size of access shall be as recommended by the development commission and approved by the village board. 
(10)  Water retention regulations. On all sites requiring water retention, the following regulations will apply: 
a.  Minimum size of a site that will permanently hold water is three acres measured at normal water elevation. 
b.  There shall be a minimum of three acres of high ground for parks around ponds up to five acres in size. Park sizes for ponds over five acres shall be negotiated. 
c.  A boundary survey showing adjacent streets, lots and rights-of-way with utilities shall be filed with the park district. 
(b)  Criteria for requiring school site dedication. The following criteria shall govern the dedication of a school site: 
(1)  Requirement and population ratio. The amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites shall be directly related to the ultimate number of students to be generated by the proposed subdivision or PUD. The land dedication requirements shall be determined by dividing (i) the estimated number of children in each of the school age classifications set forth in table no. 1 below that will be generated by the proposed subdivision or PUD by (ii) the recommended maximum number of students that can be served in the type of school which corresponds to the particular school age classification, as set forth in table no. 1 below, and then multiplying the foregoing derived quotient by (iii) the recommended minimum number of acres for a school site for each school age classification, as set forth in table no. 1 below. The product derived by the immediately foregoing multiplication calculation shall constitute the number of acres for each school age classification which the subdivider or developer must dedicate for elementary, middle and high school purposes in order to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated number of increased children in each school age classification as a result of the development of the proposed subdivision or PUD. 
(2)  School classification and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
_____
TABLE NO. 1 
School Classification by Grades Maximum Number of Students for each such School Classification Minimum Number of Acres of Land for each such School Classification Elementary schools (grades kindergarten through 6th (K-6))   600 students 11 Junior high schools (grades 7th through 8th) 1,200 students 29 High schools (grades 9th through 12th) 2,500 students 55  
_____ 
(3)  Location. School sites shall be located in accordance with the plans of the school district, or, if the school district has not planned a school site for the area occupied by the proposed subdivision or PUD, or for the neighborhood in which the proposed subdivision or PUD is located, then the school sites shall be so located as to be readily accessible to the greatest number of children projected for such neighborhood. 
(4)  Site suitability. The subdivider or developer, at its own cost or expense, shall provide to the school district soil boring data, soil compaction results and such other engineering studies, data and information pertaining to the proposed school sites which the school district may request to enable it to determine the suitability of the proposed-to-be-dedicated land for school site purposes. The school district shall have the right to reject any site which the school district determines, in accordance with sound engineering practice, is not suitable for school site purposes. 
(5)  Submittal of subdivision plat or PUD plan to school district. The subdivider or developer shall submit one copy of the proposed preliminary and final subdivision or PUD plat, together with copies of all amended subdivision or PUD plats, to the school district for its written recommendations at the same time such subdivision or PUD plat (or amended version thereof) is transmitted to the development commission or other village authority; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring receipt of a recommendation from the school district prior to action by the development commission or other village authority and/or as a condition of subdivision plat or PUD plat approval. 
(6)  Title insurance, survey, assessment plats. Each deed or other instrument conveying land to the village or the school district shall be accompanied by: (i) a commitment for a standard Form B ALTA owner's policy of title insurance issued by a title insurer licensed to do business in Illinois to insure the intended grantee's title to such real estate in an amount equal to its value computed pursuant to section 4(d) [(7)d] below, subject only to the general real estate taxes which are not due and payable at the time of the delivery of the deed, covenants, conditions and restrictions of record which do not prohibit or materially interfere with the use of the subject real estate for school use, drainage ditches, feeders, laterals and underground pipe or other conduit, and acts done or suffered by or through the intended grantee; (ii) a current land survey of the subject real estate with all corners staked, prepared by an Illinois registered land surveyor and certified to the intended grantee as meeting or exceeding the minimum requirements of both an American Land Title Association (ALTA) survey and the Illinois Land Survey Standards; and (iii) except in instances where the real estate to be conveyed has assigned to it a permanent index number or numbers which do not cover any other real estate, an assessment plat and tax division petition in form acceptable to the appropriate county authorities so that the land to be conveyed can be assigned its own permanent real estate index number for exemption purposes. 
(7)  Criteria for requiring cash contributions in lieu of land donations. 
a.  Where land dedication is not possible. Whenever any proposed subdivision or PUD is so small, as determined by the school district, that the sites required will not be large enough for practical development and maintenance of school sites, or when the available land cannot meet the standards set forth herein, or is otherwise inappropriate for a school site, the subdivider or developer shall pay to the village a cash contribution in lieu of the required land dedication. 
b.  Use of funds for school purposes. The cash contribution to be paid in lieu of land donation for school sites shall be collected and held (until such time as disbursement to the school district is required) by the village for the benefit of the school district solely for the acquisition by the school district of a school site(s) to serve the immediate and/or future needs of children from that proposed subdivision or PUD, or for the improvement (including, the construction of new buildings and building additions and improvements) of any existing school site which will predominantly serve such needs. 
c.  Return of funds. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of school site donation, is not expended for the purposes set forth in subsection (4)(b) [(7)b] above within ten years from the date of its receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer who made such contribution. 
d.  Fair market value. The amount of cash contribution in lieu of land shall be determined based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the proposed subdivision or PUD that would otherwise have been dedicated for school sites. For purposes of determining the fair market value of an acre of land as aforesaid, it shall be assumed that the subject land has all necessary utilities available to it at its perimeter, including storm sewer, sanitary sewer, water, gas, electric and communication lines and is adjacent to an open, dedicated public right-of-way, and the land shall be valued as so improved. Furthermore, for purposes of this section, the term "fair market value" shall be deemed to mean not less than $25,000.00 per acre. In the event either the school district or the subdivider or developer shall object to the foregoing fair market value figure, as the same may be amended from time to time, then the objecting party shall submit to the village an MAI appraisal from a State of Illinois certified real estate appraiser showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of the proposed subdivision or PUD or other evidence thereof. The village may, if it so desires, obtain its own appraisal or other evidence of the fair market value of such improved land in the area of the proposed subdivision or PUD. Final determination of such fair market value shall be made by the village based upon information obtained by the village or submitted to the village by the school district or the subdivider or developer. 
(8)  Cash donation. 
a.  Cash donation requirement. In addition to the land dedication requirement above or the cash contribution in lieu thereof, each developer or subdivider, as a condition of the issuance of a final or conditional occupancy permit for any part of the proposed subdivision or PUD, shall be required to donate to the village a sum of money equal to the estimated number of elementary school age children to be generated by the proposed subdivision or PUD times $1,000.00. 
b.  Use of funds. All funds collected by the village pursuant to subsection (8)(a) above shall be used solely for the benefit of those children generated by the proposed subdivision or PUD. Such funds may be used for, among other things, the following purposes: (i) school site improvements; (ii) new building construction; (iii) construction of building additions and improvements; (iv) instructional and classroom equipment and classroom furniture; and (v) library books and materials. If any portion of such funds are not expended for the purposes set forth in this section within ten years from the date of their receipt, then they shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer who made such contribution. 
(9)  Disbursement of funds to school district. All cash paid to the village pursuant to the requirements herein shall be disbursed to the school district upon approval of the village board by written request of the school district stating the proposed use of said funds. Upon request by the village, the school district shall provide to the village an annual report showing how the funds collected pursuant to this chapter have been utilized by the school district during the fiscal year covered by such annual report. 
(c)  Reserved. 
(d)  Density formula. The accompanying Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Density in the appendix shall be considered indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedicated acres or the cash contribution in lieu of unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. 
In the event a subdivider or developer or affected public body files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Density contained in the appendix, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned development and in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park districts, school districts or others. Population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.

Sec. 90-99. - Dedication and development of detention ponds or funds in lieu thereof. 
(a)  Contribution and development of detention ponds or funds required. No final plat shall be approved until such time as the subdivider shall have fully complied with the provisions of this chapter by either submitting detailed plans and specifications for the development of stormwater detention ponds on the property to be subdivided, or shall agree to deposit funds for the development of stormwater detention ponds (as required by the development of his subdivision) to be constructed off the site in an area designated by the Village of Hanover Park in accordance with subsection (c) which follows. 
(b)  Engineering studies. The developer, at his expense, shall hire a professional engineer, registered in the State of Illinois, to prepare a detailed study of the detention required by the subdivision. 
(c)  Location of detention ponds. After the required stormwater detention has been determined as specified in paragraph (a), these calculations shall be submitted to the village for review by the village engineer. 
    If the detention area required to serve the proposed subdivision is more than three acre-feet in size, the detention pond shall be constructed as part of the subdivision improvements. 
    In subdivisions where less than three acre-feet of detention is required, the developer may, upon approval by the village board, deposit with the Village of Hanover Park, in lieu of construction of detention area, the funds necessary to provide for construction of the required detention facilities of the site and as designated by the Village of Hanover Park. 
(d)  Determination of the cost of off-site detention ponds. If it has been determined (by the criteria specified in paragraph (c) above) that the detention pond is to be constructed off the site of the subdivision, the developer, at his expense, shall have a professional engineer, registered in the State of Illinois, prepare an estimate of the cost to construct the detention pond at the designated site, including the comparable cost of the land. The estimate shall be submitted to the village for review by the village engineer. 
    Upon the approval by the village, of the developer's estimate of costs, the funds in the amount of the approved estimate in the form of a cashier's check shall be deposited with the Village of Hanover Park in lieu of the construction of the detention pond on the site, which fund shall become the property of the Village of Hanover Park. By depositing such funds, the developer shall be relieved of providing such detention facilities for the subdivision and shall be allowed to use for development, that portion of the subdivision which otherwise would be required to be used for detention purposes.

(e)  Clear sight distance. An easement to protect clear sight distance not to exceed three feet above curb level shall be provided at all intersections. Such easements shall be a triangular area measured 25 feet from the intersections of any two right-of-way lines. (See article VIII.) 
(f)  Easement responsibility. Each lot owner shall be responsible for the maintenance, operation and preservation of all drainage structures, both on the surface and underground, which cross or enter upon his lot or lots. The owner may relocate, within the bounds of his lot or lots, any drainage structure subject to prior approval by the village engineer, however, he must preserve the hydraulic characteristics of such structures.

    For any locally imposed and administered tax for which a taxpayer has not received a written notice of an audit, investigation, or assessment from the local tax administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to file an application with the local tax administrator for a voluntary disclosure of the tax due. A taxpayer filing a voluntary disclosure application must agree to pay the amount of tax due, along with interest of one percent per month, for all periods prior to the filing of the application but not more than four years before the date of filing the application. A taxpayer filing a valid voluntary disclosure application may not be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty for any period before the date the application was filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the underpaid tax, unless the underpayment was the result of fraud on the part of the taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment of tax and interest must be made by no later than 90 days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid within 90 days after a final determination and the exhaustion of all appeals of the additional amount owed or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator, whichever is longer.

Upon a determination by the local tax administrator that the lien is valid, the lien shall remain in full force and effect. If the lien is determined to be improper, the local tax administrator shall: 
(1)  Timely remove the lien at the village's expense; 
(2)  Correct the taxpayer's credit record; and 
(3)  Correct any public disclosure of the improperly imposed lien.

    Department means the state department of revenue. 
    Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this village and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within this village for the portion of the interoffice channels provided within this village. Charges for that portion of the interoffice channel connecting two or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the interoffice channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the village and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the interoffice channel.

(7)  Bad debts. ( Bad debt means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or telecommunications. The burden of proving nontaxable charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications. 
    Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this state. 
    Interstate telecommunications means all telecommunications that originate and terminate within this state. 
    Person means any natural individual, firm, trust, estate, partnership, association, joint stock company, joint venture, corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed by order of any court, the federal and state governments, including state universities created by statute, or any city, town, county, or other political subdivision of this state. 
    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state.

    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the village and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this article.

As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The term "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this definition, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act (35 ILCS 120/2-27).

Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

The space thus provided shall be completely filled with joint material. The space between the shoulder of the fitting and the face of the main sewer pipe shall be one-eighth-inch thick and this space shall also be completely filled with joint material. 
(3)  The joint material used for the type 2 service connection shall be completely waterproof and shall be capable of withstanding any condition of stress or strain likely to be encountered in normal sanitary sewer construction or maintenance. Concrete encasement will not be considered waterproof. 
(4)  The fitting shall be manufactured of either cast aluminum alloy, cast iron, or vitrified clay pipe and shall be capable of receiving all normally used type of pipe for service connections. 
(5)  The type 2 fitting and drilling machine herein described shall be of the type manufactured by Smith & Loveless, Division-Union Tank Car Company, Lexana, Kansas, or the approved equal. Tapping and connection shall be made in the presence of an authorized village inspector. 
(6)  Type 1 and 2 connections, when and where used. Type 1 connections may be used in existing sanitary sewers when wye branches previously installed are readily and conveniently available. If existing wye branches cannot be found readily or are not located properly for providing the needed service, type 2 connections shall be made. When new sanitary sewers are constructed type 1 connections may be made in cases where the connection is made during construction and before backfilling of the sanitary main sewer trench. 
(7)  Type 2 connections shall be made in all cases where services are installed subsequent to construction and backfilling operations. No wye branches shall be installed and covered up for future use, except when excessive depth, new subdivision design or other unusual conditions exist, and then only with prior approval of the village engineer and the board of trustees. 
(8)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Each and every part of a sewer connection shall be inspected and approved by the superintendent or his representatives before being concealed or backfilled. 
(9)  Any person filling in an excavation without having first received the written approval of the sewer or building inspector as provided in this chapter, shall in addition to suffering the fine herein imposed, expose the sewer for inspection by the superintendent or building inspector at no cost to the Village. In any case where the inspector finds the work on any sewer not done in a satisfactory manner as herein provided, he shall serve written notice on the person to whom the permit is issued, stating wherein such work is deficient and ordering said person to remedy such defect within 24 hours. In the event such persons fail to comply therewith, the inspector shall cause such defect to be corrected at the expense of the person to whom the permit was issued. The sum of $70.00 as herein provided shall be paid to the village as a fee for the performance of the inspector, and it shall be the duty of the inspector to inspect any sewer connection or sewer pipe within the village. It shall also be the duty of said inspector to inform the approving authority of any violation of this article and to assist in the prosecution of offenders. 
(10)  All excavations for building sewer installation shall comply with the provisions of this Code relating to excavations in streets and shall be adequate guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the village. 
(11)  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of the building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the village. In the absence of Code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. 
(12)  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(13)  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or ground water to a building sewer or building drain which, in turn, are connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.

Sec. 106-165. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a)  The village may require monitoring and allowing for inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems facilities to be provided and operated at the user's own expense. Such monitoring facilities shall be provided at the end of a process wherein incompatible pollutants are used, produced, or treated. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user's premises but the village may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping, parked vehicles, or other activities of the user. 
(b)  Whenever required by the village, any industrial user shall install a large manhole or sampling chamber for each separate discharge in the building-sewer in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the village, installed and maintained at all time at user's expense, which shall have ample room in each sampling chamber to permit the village to take representative grab or composite samples for analysis. The chamber shall be safely, easily, and independently accessible to authorized representatives of the village whenever the facility is in operation or discharging. 
(c)  One of the objectives of monitoring by the village is for such monitoring to remain unexpected and unrevealed to the user. Requests by the user should not infringe upon this objective. 
(d)  When required, a flow meter shall be installed in the sampling chamber or alternate location approved by the village. The meter shall consist of a Palmer-Bowlus flume, a weir, combination level and velocity meter, magnetic or a metering device as approved by the village with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The meter must be installed and regularly calibrated by qualified technicians at a frequency set by the village, but not less than annually. At the discretion of the village, the metered water supply to the industrial plant may be used as liquid quantity where it is substantiated to the village that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the village is made in the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. 
(e)  It is the responsibility of the user to maintain a properly functioning meter and to take necessary steps if it is reasonably observable that a meter is not functioning properly. The village may require the user to measure the height of wastewater in flume to verify the meter is accurate. 
(f)  When required, a deduction water meter shall be installed for the purpose of measuring the quantity of water that is consumed as part of industrial operations, and deducting that quantity from metered water supply usage for the same period, to obtain an estimated quantity of wastewater discharged to the sewer system. Deduction water meter shall be installed in a location approved by the village. The meter device shall be as approved by the village with a recording and totalizing register for measurement of the liquid quantity. The meter must be installed and regularly calibrated by qualified technicians at a frequency set by the village but not less than annually. 
(g)  The wastewater monitoring site and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(h)  All measurements, test, and analyses of the characteristics of water and as to which reference is made in this Ordinance shall be determined in accordance with section 106-166. 
(i)  If the analytical methods from section 106-166 do not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or other applicable sampling and analytical suggested by the village. 
(j)  The procedure for sampling will be determined by the village. The samples must be properly refrigerated and preserved in accordance with methods from section 106-166 and shall be composited in proportion to the flow or time for a representative sample as determined by the village. Such sampling must be done as prescribed by the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
(k)  The sample chamber, metering device, documentation of the frequency of sampling, chain of custody documentation, sampling methods, quality control samples, and analyses of samples shall be subject, at any reasonable time, to inspection and verification by the village. 
(l)  The chain of custody (COC) is a record of sampling procedure. It must include the date; exact place; method; the time of sampling; the name of the person(s) taking the sample(s); the dates the analyses were performed; who performed the analysis; the analytical techniques used; the quality control results and the sample results. These records must be made available for a minimum of three years. The user may be notified by the village for a longer retention period. 
(m)  Where required by the village, additional control manholes or sampling chambers shall be provided at the end of each industrial process within an industrial user's facility suitable for the determination of compliance with pretreatment standards.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-09-25, §§ 13, 14, adopted August 20, 2009, repealed the former § 106-165, and enacted a new § 106-165 as set out herein. The former § 106-165 pertained to control manhole and derived from Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005. 
Sec. 106-166. - Measurements, tests, analyses. 
(a)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of water and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Waste water published by the American Public Health Association, or methods approved by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency or Manual of Laboratory Methods for Sewage Plants published by the Illinois Department of Public Health. Substances shall be determined at the control manhole. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily-accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.) Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. 
(b)  Any person discharging wastes having concentrations greater than the average concentrations as set forth herein shall, upon notifications by the approving authority, install a composite sampler with a compatible pacing (metering) device for monitoring said substances. The pacing and sampling devices shall be of a type approved by the village. All testing and measuring procedures for the analysis of pollutants shall be in conformance with title 40 CRF 136. 
(c)  The cost of all required measurements, test, and analyses shall be borne by the contributor. 
(d)  No statement contained in this chapter shall be construed as presenting any special agreement or arrangement between the Village of Hanover Park and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength of character may be accepted by the village for treatment, subject to payment thereof, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, by the industrial concern provided such payments are in accordance with federal and state guidelines for user charger system.

Sec. 106-170. - Wastewater service charges. 
    The wastewater service charges for the use of, and for the service supplied by, the wastewater facilities of the Village of Hanover Park shall consist of a basic user rate and a debt service charge. 
(a)  The basic user rate shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for the purpose of paying the cost associated with operation, maintenance, and replacement of the system. The basic user rate will be applicable for wastes having the following average strength waste characteristics: 
(1)  A five-day, 20-degree centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of mg/1. 
(2)  A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 mg/1. 
(3)  An ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) content of 16 mg/l based on 100 gpcpd. 
It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
(a)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including an equipment replacement fund for the year, for all work categories. 
(b)  Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids, BOD, and ammonia nitrogen. 
(c)  Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD, and pounds of ammonia-nitrogen to be treated. 
(d)  Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for average strength waste. 
(e)  Compute the unit costs per 1,000 gallons per pound of BOD, SS, NH3-N based on average strength waste. 
A surcharge in addition to the basic user charge will be levied to all users who discharges exceed the design concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (240 mg/l), and 16 mg/l NH3-N. The surcharge will be based on metered sewage flow for all wastes which exceed these concentrations. Section 160-173 specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge. 
The debt service charge shall be computed by dividing the annual cost of debt service of revenue bonds outstanding applicable to the construction of sewerage system improvements by the total billable flow on a cost per 1,000 gallons rates. The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public accountants to the Village of Hanover Park in their annual audit report. 
The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in the number of users and in operation and maintenance costs, including equipment replacement costs. 
(Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005) 
Sec. 106-171. - Measure of flow. 
    The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 1,000 gallons. 
(a)  If the persons or other discharges (industrial, commercial, etc.) discharging wastes into the public sewers procure any part, or all, of their water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged shall, if directed by the Village of Hanover Park, install and maintain, at is expense, water meters of a type approved by the Village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
(b)  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from metered water consumption records. 
(c)  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the superintendent. 
(Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005) 
Sec. 106-172. - Surcharge rate. 
    In the event use of the wastewater facilities by nonresidential users is determined by the village to include wastes in addition to average strength domestic waste, the user shall pay a surcharge cost in addition to the debt service charge and the basic user rate. 
(Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005) 
Sec. 106-173. - Computation of surcharges. 
    The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula: 
S = V (0.00834 [A(BOD 5 - 200) + B (SS=240) + C(NH3-N) - 16)] 
Where: 
S = Amount of Surcharge ($) V = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period (0.00834) = Unit weight of water x 10-6 per thousand gallons A = $0.197 per lb. of BOD BOD 5 = 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, mg/l 200 = Allowable BOD 5 strength B = $0.361 per lb. of SS 240 = Allowable SS, mg/l C = $2.008 per lb. of NH3-N 16 mg/l per 100 gpcd = Allowable NH3-N NH3-N = Ammonia nitrogen oxygen demand, mg/l  
The concentration of wastes discharged in excess of average strength wastes shall be used for computing surcharges and shall be established by sewage flow metering and waste sampling. Waste sampling and testing by an approved laboratory shall be completed by the discharger as often as may be binding as a basis for surcharge. 
(Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005) 
Sec. 106-174. - Computation of wastewater service charge. 
    The wastewater service charge per user shall be computed by the following formula: 
W = V(D+R)+S 
Where: 
W = Amount of wastewater service charge ($) per billing period D = Debt service charge V = Wastewater volume in thousand gallons per billing period R = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement S = Amount of surcharge (section 106-172)

5.  At the village's discretion should the village manager determine that additional significant industrial user effluent sampling is required to determine actual effluent quality based on past, documented experience with the significant industrial user. 
(o)  Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify the village of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or systems which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
(1)  The village may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 106-180. 
(2)  The village manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 106-180 of this article. 
(3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the village has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(4)  For the purpose of this requirement, flow increases of ten percent or greater, and/or the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed a significant change. 
(p)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to: Accidental discharges; discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature; a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load which may cause potential problems with the village's system, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the village of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of material, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions to be taken by the industrial user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the village, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the village, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this article. 
(3)  Failure to notify the village of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of article IV. 
(4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place, advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause, or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(q)  Reports for nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the village as the village may require. 
(r)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the village within 24-hours of becoming aware of the violation. Failure to do so will be considered a violation of the ordinance. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the village within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the village performs monitoring of the industrial user at least once per month, or if the village performed sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user received the results of this sampling. 
(s)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the village, the USEPA, Region V Waste Management Division Director and the state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge to the village of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the village, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste-stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under section 106-180(o). The notification requirement of this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under self-monitoring requirements of section 106-180. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous waste as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the village, USEPA, Region V Waste Management Division Director, and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(t)  Determination of noncompliance. The village may use grab sample(s) as required to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. 
(u)  Timing of report submissions. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. Failure to submit reports within 45 days of the due date will be considered a violation of the ordinance. If it is necessary for the village to perform inspections and/or sampling of the user's facility, or prepare a report on behalf of the person, the village shall recover the costs of such activity from the user in the same manner as debts are recoverable by law. 
(v)  Record keeping. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this ordinance. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this article, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the village. 
(w)  Search warrants. If the village has been refused access to the building, structure or property or any other part thereof, and if the superintendent has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article IV or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the village designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the village attorney, the circuit court may issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything may be searched and/or seized on the property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the village in the company of a uniformed police officer of the city having jurisdiction of the industrial user's premises. 
(x)  Confidential information. 
(1)  Any information and data relating to an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspection shall be available to the public or other governmental agencies without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the industrial user under applicable state law. 
(2)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, and until such time as the village determines that the requested information is not entitled to confidential treatment, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon written request to the governmental agencies for uses related to article IV, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, or for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person or industrial user furnishing the report. 
(3)  Information and data provided to the village which is wastewater constituents and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 203.2 will not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(4)  Information claimed by an industrial user to be confidential shall not be transmitted to the general public by the village until and unless a 30-day notification is given to the industrial user. 
(5)  The village shall implement measures to prevent the negligent release of confidential information, however, neither the village nor its employees shall be held responsible for the release of information if they acted in good faith.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-09-25, § 17, adopted August 20, 2009, repealed the former § 106-180, and enacted a new § 106-180 as set out herein. The former § 106-180 pertained to violation proceedings and derived from Ord. No. O-05-57, § 1, 11-17-2005. 
Sec. 106-181. - Enforcement procedures and penalties. 
(a)  Compulsary compliance procedures. 
(1)  Notice of violation: Whenever the village finds that any user has violated or is violating article IV, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the village may serve upon said user a written notice of violation (NOV). 
Within ten working days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a compliance plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the village. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the village to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
Failure to comply with any of the reporting requirements of this article or with details regarding reporting requirements as directed by the superintendent, is considered a violation of this article. 
(2)  Pre-enforcement conference: Where the violation(s) of an industrial user are considered significant or where past enforcement actions have not resulted in compliance, the superintendent may call a pre-enforcement conference. The superintendent may convene a pre-enforcement conference with an industry receiving a notice of violation for the purpose of establishing a compliance and reporting schedule to come into compliance with article IV. 
This conference is considered a conciliatory meeting aimed at assisting the user in coming into compliance with the ordinance. Failure to attend this conference and/or adhere to the compliance and reporting schedule agreed upon at such a conference may result in a cease and desist order. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the village to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action. 
(3)  Cease and desist order: When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, an individual wastewater discharge permit, failure to make an appearance at a pre-enforcement conference, failure to achieve compliance by the schedule and methods agreed upon in a pre-enforcement conference or any other pretreatment standards, or that a user's past violations are likely to reoccur, the superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user to cease and desist all such violations and directly the user to: 
a.  Come into compliance with all requirements within 90 days. 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations, and/or terminating discharge. 
c.  Submit to the village a report regarding its investigation into the incident of noncompliance and a compliance schedule. The compliance schedule must be certified by an authorized agent of the user, notarized and contain major milestone dates for implementation of remediation measures as well as a compliance date. The compliance date indicated in the compliance schedule cannot extend greater than 90 days beyond the date of the cease and desist order. 
The superintendent may convene a conciliatory meeting with the person so ordered to cease and desist for the purpose of establishing a compliance and reporting schedule for the person to come into compliance with the article. 
The user final compliance report will be subject to verification by village inspection and sampling within 90 days of the village's receipt of the final report. 
Failure to achieve compliance within 90 days from the date of the cease and desist or failure to submit a final compliance report indicating that compliance as been achieved, will result in show cause action being recommended. 
(4)  Show cause hearing: The superintendent may recommend to the village manager, which may order any user which causes or contributes to violations(s) of this article, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued herein, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear at a hearing and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
a.  A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed action, and directing the user to show cause why its permit should not be revoked. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
b.  The village board may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate the superintendent to: 
1.  Issue in the name of the village board notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing. 
2.  Take the evidence. 
3.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the village board for action thereon. 
c.  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual copying charges therefore. 
d.  After the village board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing either a) that the discharge permit be revoked and the service be disconnected or b) that following a specified time the permit shall be revoked and sewer service discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances have been installed and operated properly to comply with the discharge permit or c) direct the user to cease the unauthorized discharge effective after a specified period of time or d) that such other relief as deemed necessary [by] the village board to abate the discharge be granted. Further orders and directives as are necessary may be used. 
e.  Following an order or revocation, the user shall cease discharging to the village's POTW. Failure to do so shall be evidence of continuing harm to the village and provide grounds for granting of injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders. 
(b)  Revocation of permit. 
(1)  Conditions for revocation: Any industrial user who violates article IV, an order issued pursuant to section 106-181(a) of this article, the Illinois Environmental Protection Act or the Federal Act, or regulations promulgated under either Act, or any of the following is subject to having its wastewater discharge permit revoked: 
a.  Failure of an industrial user to fully and accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its wastewater discharge as determined by the industrial user or the village's analysis; 
b.  Failure of the industrial user to fully and accurately report significant changes in process activity which could affect its wastewater discharge or wastewater constituents and characteristics; 
c.  Refusal of reasonable access to the industrial user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring by the village's representatives; 
d.  Tampering with, disrupting, or destroying village equipment; 
e.  Failure to report an accidental discharge of pollutants; 
f.  Failure to report an upset of the industrial user's treatment facilities; or 
g.  violation of any condition of the wastewater discharge permit. 
(2)  Procedures for revocation. 
a.  The village may order any industrial user who causes or allows any action, which is subject to revocation under section 106-181(b)(1) above, to show cause at a hearing why its wastewater discharge permit should not be revoked. 
b.  Following an order for the revocation of its wastewater discharge permit, the industrial user shall cease discharging to the POTW in accordance with the terms of said order. Failure to do so shall be a prima facie evidence of the continuing harm to the village and provide grounds for the granting of injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders. 
(c)  Order to show cause regarding disconnection. The village may, upon discovering an ongoing or potential discharge to the village which presents or may present imminent danger to the environment or the health and welfare of persons or which threatens to interfere with operations of the POTW, immediately issue an order to the responsible industrial user to show cause why the village should not disconnect service, revoke the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit or seek injunctive relief to prohibit the industrial user from making the discharge to the village. 
(d)  Immediate disconnection of service. 
(1)  Conditions of immediate disconnection of service: Any industrial user is subject to immediate disconnection of service under either of the following conditions: 
a.  Whenever immediate disconnection is required to halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the village which reasonably appears to the village to present imminent danger to the environment or the health and welfare of persons or which threatens to interfere with operation of the village; or 
b.  Whenever the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit is revoked. 
(2)  Procedures for immediate disconnection: Notwithstanding any other sections of this article, the village shall have the authority, after informal notice to the industrial user, to immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of pollutants to the village that reasonably appears to present imminent danger to the environment, or the health and welfare of persons, or which threatens to interfere with operations of the village. When the village determines that such an emergency exists, he shall issue a verbal order, followed immediately by a written order, to the industrial user stating the problem and requiring immediate cessation of the discharge. The village's actions may include disconnection of wastewater collection service as well as shut-off of the water supply service. The village shall obtain the concurrence of the village's attorney before initiating action. Methods of informal notice shall include, but not be limited to, any of the following: Personal conversation between the industrial user and village employees, telephone calls, letters, hand delivered messages or notices posted at the industrial user's premises or point of discharge. 
(e)  Elimination of discharger/reinstatement. Any industrial user notified of a disconnection of wastewater treatment service or revocation of its wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of failure of the industrial user to comply voluntarily with the disconnection or revocation order, the village shall take such steps as are deemed necessary, including immediate blockage or severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the village system or damage to any person. The village may reinstate the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. 
(f)  Injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this article, wastewater discharge permit or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard, the village may petition the circuit court through the village's attorney for the issuance of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the industrial user. Such other actions as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be sought by the village. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a prerequisite to taking other action against a user. 
(g)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  Any user that is found to have violated an order of the village or who has failed to comply with the provisions of this article and the orders, rules and regulations, wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount of no less than $1,000.00 or more than $10,000.00 for each violation. For the purpose of this section, each day in which any such violation shall occur shall be deemed a separate violation, and a separate violation shall be deemed to have occurred for each constituent, found to exceed the limits established in article IV during such day. 
(2)  The village may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the village. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court may take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factors as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for taking other action against a user.

(j)  Remedies nonexclusive. The provisions in section 106-181 are not exclusive remedies. The village reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Further, the village is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. 
(k)  Additional remedies. 
(1)  In addition to the remedies available to the village set forth elsewhere in this ordinance, if the village is fined by the State of Illinois or USEPA for violation of the village's NPDES permit or violations of water quality standards as a result of a discharge of pollutants, then the fine, including all village legal, sampling, analytical testing costs, and any other related costs shall be charged to the responsible industrial user. Such charges shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies the village may have under this article, statutes, regulations, at law and in equity. 
(2)  If the discharge from any industrial user causes a deposit, obstruction or damage to any village wastewater facility, the village shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be promptly removed or cause the damage to be promptly repaired. The cost of such work, including materials, labor and supervision, shall be borne by the person(s), or industrial user causing such deposit, obstruction or damage. 
(3)  The remedies provided in this article shall not be exclusive and the village may seek whatever other remedies [as] authorized by statute, at law or in equity against any person or industrial user violating the provisions of article IV. 
(4)  In addition to any fine levied under section 106-181, the village may, where the circumstances of the particular case so dictate, seek injunctive relief to prohibit the user from discharging into the sanitary sewer system, or provide such other affirmative relief as may be appropriate. 
(l)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section "upset," means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with village pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was being operated at the time in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the village and the treatment plant operator within 24-hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information was provided verbally, a written submission must be provided within five days: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of the noncompliance. 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or, if not connected, the anticipated time noncompliance is expected to continue. 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the noncompliance. 
(3)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to prevent reoccurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(4)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with village pretreatment standards. 
(5)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with village pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(m)  General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with article IV if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along with or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A village limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No village limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(n)  Test of good faith effort. When determining an appropriate enforcement response to an incident of noncompliance, the village will consider the apparent attitude of the user towards the effort required to achieve and maintain compliance with the ordinance. If a user appears to be acting in good faith to comply with the ordinance, the village may choose an enforcement action on a more conciliatory level that if a user does not appear to be acting in good faith to comply with the ordinance. 
For the purpose of establishing a good faith effort on part of the user, the village will measure the user's effort against the following standard, as stated in Legislative History of the Clean Water Act, No. 95-14, Vol. 3, p.463: 
"The Act requires industry to take extraordinary efforts if the vital and ambitious goals of the Congress are to be met. This means that business-as-usual is not enough. Prompt, vigorous, and in many cases expensive pollution control measures must be initiated and completed as promptly as possible. In assessing the good faith of a discharger, the discharger is to be judged against these criteria. Moreover, it is an established principle, which applies to this act, that administrative and judicial review are sought on the discharger's own time."

Sec. 110-1.7. - Related laws. 
    Where the conditions imposed by any provision herein upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision herein or any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations that are more restrictive (or impose higher standards of requirements) shall govern.

The interpretation or determination made by the zoning administrator shall be effective with respect to application for approval of the proposed development only to the extent such an interpretation or determination is set forth in the letter of interpretation and only when it has received written approval from the village attorney. No letter of interpretation shall be valid for a period longer than one year from the date of issuance, unless final approval has been granted for the proposed development or use in accordance with this chapter. 
e.  Any letter of interpretation issued by the zoning administrator shall specify the facts, reasons, analysis, and standards upon which the interpretation is based. No use interpretation shall authorize any use in a zoning district unless the zoning administrator determines that the use is substantially similar to a permitted use in that district. No interpretation shall have the effect of amending, abrogating, or waiving any standard or requirement established in this chapter.

Sec. 110-4.2. - Comprehensive plan amendments. 
    4.2.1.  Purpose; role of comprehensive plan in administration of chapter. The comprehensive plan of the village shall serve as the basic policy guide for the administration of this chapter. The comprehensive plan serves as the statement of goals and policies to guide new development and redevelopment in the village. It therefore is the intent of the village to administer this chapter in accordance with the comprehensive plan. The goals and policies of the comprehensive plan may be amended from time to time to meet the changing requirements of the village. Such amendments may at times be necessary to accommodate proposed development or redevelopment of property that may not be consistent with the comprehensive plan. This section therefore establishes the procedures for amending the comprehensive plan. 
    4.2.2.  Initiation of amendments. An amendment to the comprehensive plan may be initiated only by the development commission, the president and board of trustees, or the owner of property proposing development of such property under this chapter that may be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan. 
    4.2.3.  Filing of applications. 
a.  Where an amendment to the comprehensive plan is proposed by someone other than the development commission or president and board of trustees, an application requesting the amendment shall be filed with the zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by a written statement from the applicant stating the basis for the request. 
b.  Within a reasonable time after submission of the application, the zoning administrator shall schedule the application for a public hearing before the development commission. The zoning administrator shall forward copies of the application and all supporting materials to the development commission in advance of the public hearing. 
    4.2.4.  Staff review. Upon receiving an application requesting an amendment, or upon an instruction from the president and board of trustees or development commission that it will consider a proposed amendment, the zoning administrator shall review the proposed amendment to evaluate its effect on the integrity of the comprehensive plan and this chapter. The zoning administrator may deliver copies of the proposed amendment to appropriate government agencies for review and comment. Prior to the scheduled public hearing, the zoning administrator shall deliver to the development commission a written report incorporating or summarizing the comments of the community development department and other departments or agencies. 
    4.2.5.  Action by the development commission. 
a.  The development commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed amendment. 
b.  Notice of hearing. Notice shall follow the procedures for posting notice of public hearings in section 4.10.1 of this chapter. 
c.  In considering the amendment, the development commission shall review the proposed amendment, the standards set forth in section 4.2.6 below, the report of the zoning administrator, and any oral and written comments received by the development commission before or at the public hearing or otherwise made part of the record of the development commission on the application. Based on this information, the development commission shall submit, within a reasonable time, a report and recommendation to the president and board of trustees on whether or not the proposed amendment should be adopted. 
    4.2.6.  Standards for reviewing proposed amendments. In deciding whether to recommend adoption of a proposed amendment to the comprehensive plan, the development commission shall consider whether the amendment is necessary based on one or more of the following factors: 
a.  There has been a change in projections or assumptions (such as demographic trends or the availability of public facilities) from those on which the comprehensive plan is based; or 
b.  The data used as the basis for formulating the comprehensive plan are in error or out of date; or 
c.  New issues or needs have presented themselves to the village that are not adequately addressed in the comprehensive plan; and 
d.  The amendment will not adversely affect the character of the area in which the proposed development is to be located. 
    4.2.7.  Action by the president and board of trustees. Upon receiving the report of the zoning administrator and the report and recommendation of the development commission, without further public hearing the president and board of trustees may adopt the proposed amendment by ordinance, may reject the proposed amendment, or may refer the matter back to the development commission for further consideration. 
    4.2.8.  Effect of denial. No application for an amendment shall be accepted by the village that is proposed by someone other than the president and board of trustees or development commission, and which is identical or substantially similar to a proposed amendment for the same parcel or parcels of land which have been rejected by the president and board of trustees within the previous 365 days. 
    4.2.9.  Typographical or drafting errors. Notwithstanding any other provisions set forth above, amendments to correct typographical or drafting errors in the comprehensive plan may be adopted by the president and board of trustees at a regular meeting without the posting or personal delivery of prior notice and without a public hearing.

d.  The review of architectural and site plans provided for in this section is intended to be only a part of the zoning and subdivision review procedure of the Village of Hanover Park development review process. Site plan approval does not in any way signify final approval of any portion of a project. 
e.  A building permit for uses that are subject to site plan review may be issued after the zoning administrator approves a site plan, provided that all other requirements of all other applicable village codes and ordinances are satisfied. 
    4.3.3.  Scope of site plan review. The zoning administrator, when evaluating site plans, will review: 
a.  The relationship of the site plan to the policies, goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan.

Where the proposed use does comply with the terms of this chapter, then the zoning administrator shall issue the appropriate permit or certificate of occupancy within a reasonable time. 
    4.4.5.  Effect of approval. The issuance of a permit or certificate of occupancy for a permitted use allows the owner of the property, and any subsequent owner, to establish and continue the use for which the permit or certificate of occupancy is issued, subject to compliance with all village ordinances. 
(Code 1975, ch. 27, § 4.4) 
Sec. 110-4.5. - Special uses. 
    4.5.1.  Purpose. The classification of "special use" is established to provide for the location of those uses generally compatible with the other land uses permitted in a zoning district but which, because of their unique characteristics, or potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and the village as a whole, require individual review of their location, design, configuration, and/or operation and the imposition of individualized conditions in order to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular location. Only those uses designated in articles V and VI as "special uses" in a given district shall be treated as such. 
    4.5.2.  Authority. Special uses shall be authorized or denied by the president and board of trustees in accordance with the regulations and conditions set forth in this chapter for special uses.

    4.5.6.  Decisions. After the conclusion of the public hearing the development commission shall adopt and forward its recommendations to the president and board of trustees accompanied by findings of fact specifying the reason or reasons for recommending the approval or disapproval of the special use. The decision of the president and board of trustees on the special use application shall be final. 
    4.5.7.  Standards of review. 
a.  No special use shall be recommended for approval by the development commission to the president and board of trustees unless the special use meets the following standards: 
(1)  The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
(2)  The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the uses already lawfully established or permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood. 
(3)  The establishment of the special use will support the policies, goals, objectives, and plans of the comprehensive plan of the village.

    4.5.8.  Conditions and guarantees. 
a.  In any recommendation for the granting of any special use, the development commission may recommend and/or the president and board of trustees may by the ordinance granting any special use require such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards and requirements specified in section 110-4.5.7. 
b.  In any recommendation for the granting of any special use, the development commission may recommend and/or the president and board of trustees may by the ordinance granting any special use require greater lot sizes, yards, or other development standards than the minimums established in the applicable zoning district. 
c.  No special use granted by the president and board of trustees shall be effective for a period longer than 12 months from the effective date of the ordinance granting such special use, or from August 21, 1986 with respect to special uses including sections, phases or portions thereof granted prior to the passage of this amendment unless a building permit has been issued and the construction or alteration of a building has been started or the use has commenced within such period.

    4.6.4.  Standards for approval. Prior to recommending approval of a planned unit development or the zoning of any land for said purpose, the development commission shall make specific findings of fact that all the following standards have been met: 
a.  Ownership and site: The site of the planned unit development is under single ownership and/or unified control. 
b.  Consistency with comprehensive plan: The development is consistent with the policies, goals, objectives and recommendations of the comprehensive plan. 
c.  Compatibility: The uses proposed in a planned unit development are of a type and so located as to exercise no undue detrimental influence upon surrounding properties, and shall be compatible with each other. 
d.  Parking requirements: Unless otherwise determined and approved as an element of the planned unit development proposal, the development adheres to the parking requirements provided for in this chapter for the particular use or uses proposed. 
e.  Traffic: Adequate provisions have been designed to provide ingress and egress to minimize traffic congestion on the public streets. 
f.  General design: The planned unit development is designed so as to support, enhance, and protect the public health, safety, comfort, or general welfare. In addition to the specific standards, the development commission shall recommend approval or denial of the proposed planned unit development by setting forth with particularity in what respect the proposal would or would not be in the public interest including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  In what respects the proposed plan is or is not consistent with the stated purpose of the planned unit development regulations; 
(2)  The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements and standards of the planned unit development regulations; 
(3)  The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including but not limited to the density, dimension, area, bulk, and use, and the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the public interest; 
(4)  The physical design of the proposed plan and the manner in which said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic, provide for and protect designated common open space, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment; 
(5)  The relationship and compatibility, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed plan to the abutting properties and neighborhood; 
(6)  The desirability of the proposed plan to physical development, tax base, and economic well-being of the entire community. 
g.  Conditions and restrictions. Prior to recommending the granting of any planned unit development special use, the development commission may recommend or the president and board of trustees may stipulate such conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, location, construction, maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary for the protection and requirements specified herein or as may be from time to time required. In all cases in which special uses are granted, the president and board of trustees may require such evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary to attempt to insure compliance with the conditions stipulated in connection therewith. 
    4.6.5.  Approval of final plat. The final planned unit development plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plat as approved. If desired by the developer, the final plat may be submitted in stages with each stage reflecting the approved preliminary plat provided that such stages conform to all requirements of these regulations. The required procedure for approval of a final plat shall be: 
a.  A final planned unit development plat and other supporting data required for approval shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. 
The final plat must be submitted for approval in accordance with the agreed upon scheduling from date of approval of preliminary plan, but not later than one year. In the event that same is not done, the village may initiate such zoning changes as it deems necessary to preserve public interest. 
Final plats and supporting data shall show in detail the design, location, and use of all buildings and overall land development, and shall include the following: 
(1)  An accurate legal description of the area under immediate development within the planned unit development. 
(2)  An accurate survey of said area. 
(3)  A subdivision plat of all subdivided lots proposed for development. 
(4)  Conformance with the preliminary land use and zoning plan. 
(5)  The actual placement of buildings to be constructed shall not violate the separation between buildings, streets, or lot lines as approved on the preliminary plan. 
(6)  The plat shall be certified true and correct and dated by a State of Illinois registered land surveyor, or certified civil engineer, and the plat shall be in conformance with all applicable statutory requirements.

b.  After review of the final plat, the development commission shall recommend approval, disapproval, or approval subject to such conditions as the development commission may recommend to the president and board of trustees. 
c.  The president and board of trustees, after receipt of final plat from the development commission shall approve, disapprove, or refer back to the development commission the final plat. 
    4.6.6.  Filing the final plat. The ordinance authorizing the planned unit development shall be effective only upon recording by the village clerk of the planned unit development plats and supporting data with the county recorder of deeds unless the ordinance shall otherwise provide. No permit, allowing construction of a building or other development, shall take place until after the adoption of the ordinance of the approval and recording of the final plat. 
    4.6.7.  Changes in the planned unit development. The planned unit development project shall be developed only according to the approved and recorded final plat and supporting data. The recorded final plat and supporting data together with any recorded amendments thereto shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, and assigns in title thereto and shall limit and control the use of the site and location of structures in the planned unit development project as set forth therein. 
a.  Major changes. Changes that increase the density, the height of buildings, reductions of proposed open space, changes in the development schedule, changes in the final governing agreements, provisions, or covenants, changes to roadway width, points of ingress or egress, areas to be subject to utility easements, building locations that decrease space between buildings, or changes in the proposed use of a structure, may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan and supporting data and following the "preliminary approval" steps and subsequent amendment of the final planned unit development plan. 
b.  Minor changes. The president and board of trustees may approve minor changes in the planned unit development without submission of a new preliminary plan if such changes do not change the concept or the intent of the development. 
    4.6.8.  Schedule. No approval for a planned unit development shall be valid longer than 12 months from the effective date of the ordinance granting such planned unit development, or from August 21, 1986, with respect to planned unit developments including sections, phases, or portions thereof granted prior to the passage of this amendment, unless a building permit has been obtained and the construction or alteration of a building has been started or the use commenced within such period.

Sec. 110-4.7. - Variations. 
    4.7.1.  Purpose. The variation process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this chapter in those cases where strict application of those requirements will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this chapter. In no event, however, shall the village board grant a variation that would allow the establishment of a use not otherwise allowed in a zoning district or that would change the zoning district classification of any or all of the affected property. 
    4.7.2.  Authority. Variations shall be authorized or denied by the village board in accordance with the regulations and conditions set forth in this section 110-4.7 for variances. No application for a variation shall be acted upon by the village board until after: 
a.  A public hearing has been held by the development commission after due notice by publication as required by section 110-4.7.4 herein; and 
b.  A written report containing recommendations, findings of fact, and other appropriate commentary and conditions is adopted by the development commission and forwarded to the village board. 
    4.7.3.  Initiation. An application for a variation may be made to the zoning administrator by the owner of the property, or his/her designated representative, for which the variance is proposed to be located or established. 
    4.7.4.  Notice of hearing. Notice shall follow the procedures for notice of public hearings in section 110-4.10.1 of this chapter. 
    4.7.5.  Processing. 
a.  Upon receipt of a complete application, including all required supporting documentation, the zoning administrator shall schedule the petition for a public hearing. 
b.  All information and documents applicable to the variance application shall be submitted to the zoning administrator at least 30 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting of the development commission, during which a public hearing will be held. 
    4.7.6.  Decisions. 
a.  The development commission shall hold a public hearing which hearing may be continued by the development commission. 
b.  Following the adjournment of the public hearing, the development commission shall adopt and forward its written recommendations and findings of fact on the variance to the village board. The village board shall make the final decision on the variation. 
    4.7.7.  Authorized variations. Variations from the regulations of this chapter may be recommended by the development commission to the village board only in accordance with the standards set forth in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others: 
a.  To permit up to 20 percent reduction in the front, rear, or side yards in residential zoning districts as required by this chapter, and to permit an unlimited reduction in the front, rear and side yards in all other zoning districts as required by this chapter. 
b.  To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not more than 20 percent, or a minimum of one space, of the applicable regulations. 
c.  To increase by not more than ten percent the maximum gross floor area of any use so limited by the applicable regulations. 
d.  To recommend the issuance of a permit for the reconstruction of a nonconforming building that has been destroyed or damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost by fire, acts of God, or the public enemy, where the development commission shall find some compelling public necessity requiring a continuation of the nonconforming building. 
e.  To exceed any of the authorized variations allowed under this chapter, when a lot of record or a zoning lot is, by reason of the exercise of the power of eminent domain by any authorized jurisdictional body, changed from a complying lot to a lot in violation of applicable requirements hereof. 
f.  To eliminate the requirement of enclosing loading spaces when a building fronts on more than two streets. 
g.  To permit up to 20 percent reduction in any particular landscape requirement. 
Additionally, application may be made to the zoning administrator for an administrative variance of no more than ten percent of any particular landscape requirement in lieu of the development commission process and village board action, provided the intent of such requirements are met and the variance otherwise meets all requirements for a variation. The application or decision concerning an administrative landscape variance shall not eliminate the potential to apply to the development commission for the same or similar variation. 
h.  To recommend a variation to other development requirements where, by reason of an exceptional situation, surroundings, or a condition of a zoning lot or lot of record, or by reason of exceptional narrowness or shape of a zoning lot or lot of record, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, the strict application of provisions of this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or particular hardship upon the owner of such property, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience to such owner, provided such relief as recommended be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the general purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan as established by the regulations and provisions contained in this chapter. 
    4.7.8.  Standards for review. 
a.  No variation shall be recommended for approval by the development commission to the village board unless the variation meets the following standards: 
(1)  That the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality, and will be consistent with the goals and objectives set forth in the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  That the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances. 
(3)  For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the development commission, in determining that there are particular difficulties or hardships, shall also take into consideration the extent to which the following standards, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence: 
(a)  That the particular surroundings and topographical conditions of the specific property involved will bring hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out. 
(b)  That the conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be generally applicable to other property within the same zoning classification. 
(c)  That the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to receive a greater economic return. 
(d)  That the alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person previously or currently having an ownership interest in the property. 
(e)  That the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or unduly injurious to other property or improvements in the general area in which the property is located. 
(f)  That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to abutting property or substantially increase the danger of fire or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the general area. 
(g)  The design of the proposed variation will minimize adverse effects, including visual impacts, of the proposed use on abutting and nearby properties. 
(h)  For variations from landscape requirements in section 110-6.3 the use of impervious surfaces on the property has been minimized to the greatest extent feasible. 
    4.7.9. Conditions and restrictions. 
a.  Petitions for variations shall include submittal of a site plan to demonstrate conformance to the requirements, where practical, of section 110-4.3, 
b.  The development commission may recommend and the village board may require such conditions and restrictions upon the property to be benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this chapter, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the general area, and to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
c.  No variation granted by ordinance of the president and village board shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months from the effective date of the ordinance granting such variation, including sections, phases or portions thereof granted prior to the passage of this chapter, unless a building permit has been issued and the construction or alteration of a building started or the use commenced within such period. 
d.  A variation approved shall contain the following condition: If the property to which the variation applies becomes subject to: new development; a new application for a variation; increase in the intensity of use; or substantial building renovation; or, expansion or reconstruction of parking areas, the variation(s) previously granted pursuant to this section may become null and void if noted in subsequent site plan, special use, variance, or other development approval. 
e.  For variation of landscape requirements, the development commission may recommend, and the village board may impose, any one or more of the following conditions and restrictions on the property benefited by a variation as may be deemed necessary to assure compliance with the applicable standards of section 110-6.3, to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, or to implement the general purpose of section 110-6.3: 
(1)  Additional or substitute landscape plantings or areas on-site. 
(2)  Construction of masonry walls in lieu of landscape screening. 
(3)  Installation of decorative wrought iron or other appropriate fencing.

(2)  Addition, removal, or replacement of siding; 
(3)  Addition, removal or replacement of window sash or window units;

The zoning administrator shall, within 14 days following the receipt of a completed application for a permit for minor exterior modifications within the Ontarioville Historic District, approve, deny, or approve with conditions the permit application. If the application for a permit is denied, the applicant may appeal to the village manager's designee within seven days. 
b.  Permits for a significant alteration. Improvements, construction, removal, or demolition other than minor exterior modifications shall require a permit for significant alteration. The zoning administrator shall, within 14 working days following the receipt of a permit application for a significant alteration approve, approve with condition, or deny the application. 
The applicant must meet all requirements for a building permit. 
(1)  Review criteria for a significant alteration. In making a determination whether to recommend approval, approval with conditions or denial of a permit for a significant alteration, the zoning administrator shall consider the purpose and intent of the Ontarioville Historic District. The standards to be used by the zoning administrator in making their determination shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(a)  The preservation or restoration of the significant original qualities or character of the property, structure or improvements, including, if significant, its landscaping. 
(b)  The removal or alteration of any historic or distinctive architectural or landscape features. 
(c)  The compatibility of the architectural style and design detailing of the proposed construction, or significant alteration, with the original architecture of the property or the exterior architectural character of other structures within the Ontarioville Historic District. 
(d)  The compatibility of the general design, arrangement, scale, texture or materials of the construction or alteration, with the historic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural and landscape values of significance in the Ontarioville Historic District. 
(e)  The relationship of the location of the construction, alteration, or removal to streets, public or semipublic ways and any other structures, property, or landscaping within the Ontarioville Historic District. 
(f)  Construction, alteration and demolition shall be allowed only in accordance with the following additional standards: 
(i)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to minimize the alteration of significant features of the property, structure or site, and its environment. 
(ii)  All property and structures shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier or later appearance shall be discouraged. 
(iii)  Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a property, structure, or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and preserved. 
(iv)  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a property, structure, or site shall be protected. 
(v)  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material need not be identical to but should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other structures. 
(vi)  The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
(vii)  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or abutting to, any project. 
(viii)  Contemporary design for new construction, alterations, and additions to existing properties or structures shall not be discouraged when such construction, alterations, and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
(ix)  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would not be impaired. 
(2)  Zoning administrator review process for a significant alteration. 
(a)  If the zoning administrator finds that the work proposed in the application will comply with the review criteria in section 5.7.5(b)(2), the administrator shall issue a building permit for significant alteration. 
(b)  The zoning administrator shall briefly state the reasons for the decision in writing and may recommend conditions to assure appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, scale, material, color, location, landscaping, or other elements of appearance of the building, property, or structure involved. 
(c)  If the zoning administrator finds that the proposed work does not meet the review criteria and that it will adversely affect or destroy any significant historic, cultural, aesthetic, or architectural feature or value of the structure or property within the Ontarioville Historic District or is inappropriate or inconsistent with the guidelines, the zoning administrator shall deny the application. 
    5.7.6, 5.7.7. Reserved.

Sec. 110-6.2. - Off-street parking and loading. 
    6.2.1.  Scope and application. 
a.  Scope of regulations. The off-street parking and loading provisions of this chapter shall apply as follows: 
(1)  For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land established after the effective date of this chapter, accessory parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required in this chapter. However, where a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter and construction is begun within six months of such effective date and diligently pursued to completion (completion to be accomplished within 12 months of the effective date of this chapter), parking and loading facilities in the amounts as previously required for the issuance of said building permit may be provided. 
(2)  When the intensity of use of any building, structure, or premises shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required herein shall be provided. 
(3)  Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required for such new use. 
b.  Existing parking and loading facilities. Accessory off-street parking and loading facilities in existence on the effective date of this chapter and located on the same lot as the building or use such facilities served shall not hereafter be reduced below the current parking and loading requirements, or if already less than the current standards, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a similar new building or use under the provisions of this chapter. 
c.  Permissive parking and loading facilities. Nothing in the chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off-street parking or loading facilities to serve any existing use of land or buildings, provided adherence to all regulations herein governing the location, design, and operation of such facilities. 
d.  Damage or destruction. For any conforming or legally nonconforming building or use in existence on the effective date of this chapter, which subsequently thereto is damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion, or other cause, and which is reconstructed, reestablished, or repaired, off-street parking or loading facilities need not be provided, except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time of such damage or destruction shall be restored or continued in operation. However, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this chapter for equivalent new uses or construction. 
    6.2.2.  Off-street parking. 
a.  General requirements. 
(1)  All parking spaces required to serve buildings or uses erected or established after the effective date of this chapter shall be located on the same zoning lot as the building or use served, except that parking spaces to serve business, commercial, industrial, and office buildings or uses may be located within 500 feet of such use if said spaces are located in a business, commercial, industrial, or office district. 
Buildings or uses existing on the effective date of this chapter subsequently altered or enlarged so as to require the provision of parking spaces under this chapter may be served by parking facilities located on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use served is located, provided such facilities are within 500 feet of such use. Owners of property nonconforming as to parking, who elect to provide parking and become conforming, may locate such parking on land other than the zoning lot on which the building or use is located, as allowed in this section. 
Off-street parking spaces for property zoned for residential use may be located in any yard, except a maximum of two spaces may be located within the required front yard or corner side yard. 
Off-street parking spaces are prohibited in the following yards in the business park district and high cube district: 
Feet 
(a)  Front, abutting an arterial or collector street ..... 50 
(b)  Front, abutting an interior street ..... 50

(f)  Rear interior ..... 10 
(g)  Rear; abutting an arterial or collector street ..... 50 
(h)  Perimeter, abutting a residential district ..... 60 
(i)  Perimeter, abutting a nonresidential district other than business park or high cube district ..... 25 
Parking may extend into the 50-foot rear yard building setback to within 30 feet of an arterial or collector street, provided the area between the parking and the abutting arterial or collector street is bermed and landscaped to a height of six feet at 70 percent opacity. Coniferous plant material must be used to provide a yearround screen. 
(2)  Size of parking stalls. Except for parallel parking spaces, each required off-street parking space shall be at least nine feet in width and at least 18 feet in length, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, or columns. Such space shall have a vertical clearance of at least seven feet, and shall be measured at right angles to the axis of the vehicle. Compact car spaces of at least 81/2 feet in width and 16 feet in length shall be allowed supplemental to required parking spaces. For parallel parking, the length of the parking space shall be increased to 22 feet. All other requirements as to size shall be as hereinafter set forth in table 6.2.2, Off-street Parking.

(3)  Handicapped parking. Any parking area for use by the general public shall provide parking spaces designated and located to adequately accommodate the handicapped, and these shall be clearly marked as such. Handicapped stalls shall be located in close proximity to the principal building, supplied in number as per this section and constructed in accordance with State of Illinois accessibility standards. Each stall shall be at least 16 feet in width by 181/2 feet in length. The designation of handicapped parking stalls shall constitute consent by the property owner to the enforcement by the village of the restriction of use of such spaces to handicapped motorists.

(5)  Shared parking. 
(a)  Off-street parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively if the total number of spaces so provided is not less than the sum of the separate requirements of each such use and all regulations governing location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served are adhered to. Further, no parking space or portion thereof shall serve as a required space for more than one use unless otherwise authorized by the president and board of trustees or as provided in 6.2.2.a. 
(b)  The zoning administrator may authorize a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces for two or more nonresidential uses jointly providing off-street parking when their respective hours of operation do not overlap. (See schedule of shared parking.) Reduction of joint use parking shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Not more than 50 percent of the parking spaces required for a building or use may be supplied by parking facilities required for any other building or use. 
(2)  The number of shared spaces for two or more distinguishable land uses shall be determined by the following procedure: 
(a)  Multiply the minimum parking required for each individual use, as set forth in the attached schedule of required parking, by the appropriate percentage indicated, for each of the six designated time periods. 
(b)  Add the resulting sums for each of the six columns. 
(c)  The minimum parking requirement shall be the highest sum among the six columns resulting from the above calculations.

(3)  If one or all of the land uses for which joint parking facilities is proposed does (do) not conform to one of the general land use classifications in the shared parking schedule as determined by the zoning administrator, then the petitioner shall submit sufficient data to indicate that there is not substantial conflict in the principal operating hours of the uses. 
(4)  The property owners involved in the joint use of off-street parking facilities shall submit a legal agreement approved by the village attorney guaranteeing that the parking spaces shall be maintained so long as the uses requiring parking are in existence or unless the required parking is provided elsewhere in accordance with the provisions of this article. Such instrument shall be recorded by the property owner with the county recorder of deeds, and a copy filed with the zoning administrator. 
(5)  Fractional parking spaces. When determination of the number of off-street parking spaces required by this chapter results in a requirement of a fractional space, any fraction of less than one-half may be disregarded, while a fraction of one-half or more, shall be counted as one parking space. 
(6)  Use of required parking spaces. Except as may otherwise be provided in the granting of special uses, required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for uses listed in section 110-6.2.3 shall be solely for the parking of passenger automobiles of patrons, occupants, or employees of such uses. 
(7)  Design and maintenance. 
(a)  Plan: The design of access drives and parking lots or areas shall be in accordance with standards contained in chapter 38 of the Municipal Code. 
(b)  Surfacing: All open off-street parking areas shall be paved with a hard surface material such as concrete, asphalt, and/or brick and shall drain properly as required by chapter 38 of the Municipal Code. 
(c)  Landscaping and screening: Landscaping and screening shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of section 110-6.3. 
(d)  Lighting: Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be down lit away from residential properties and public streets in such a way as not to create a nuisance. However, in no case shall such lighting exceed one footcandle measured at the lot line. 
b.  Specific requirements. All off-street parking spaces hereinafter required by this chapter shall be designed and provided in accordance with one of the formulae set forth in the schedule of parking requirements. Parking spaces for accessory uses not specifically enumerated within a parking class shall be assumed to be included in the principal (permitted or special) use requirement. If, for any reason, the classification of any use for the purpose of determining the amount of off-street parking or the number of spaces to be provided by such use is not readily determinable hereunder, the parking class of such use shall be established by the zoning administrator. 
When computing required parking spaces, the total number of required spaces shall be based upon use(s) of the zoning lot or portion thereof. Therefore, one principal use may actually contain two or more parking class uses (e.g., retail sales and warehousing.) 
In the event this chapter does not specify the number of parking spaces for a specific use, the zoning administrator shall determine the number of spaces required. In determining the number of spaces required for a proposed use the zoning administrator shall consider the number of parking spaces required for the listed use most similar to the proposed use in terms of parked vehicles expected to be generated. In determining the number of parked vehicles likely to be generated by a use, the zoning administrator shall consider the square footage occupied by the use where appropriate. In the alternative, the zoning administrator may consider the number of employees and patrons anticipated for the proposed use. 
c.  Land banking of required parking. 
(1)  Land banking authorized. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the board of trustees may authorize not more than 50 percent of the off street parking spaces required by this article in a business park, high cube or limited industrial zoning district may be left as open space which can be readily converted to parking facilities ("land bank"). The parking facilities to be constructed and the land bank, if converted to parking spaces, must comply with the off street parking facility requirements of this article at the time the land bank is approved. 
(2)  Land bank plans required. The owner of the property making a land bank request shall submit a detailed land bank parking plan for review and approval by the board of trustees and an application fee of $50.00 for each parking space to be land banked. This land bank parking plan shall show both the full compliance with the parking regulations of this article and the land bank area showing the reduced number of parking spaces and interim use of the land banked area. 
(3)  Termination of land banking. The board of trustees shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to require the property owner or successor, at any time to construct all or a portion of the land banked parking facilities, with the zoning administrator providing notice to the owner that the land banked parking facilities must be constructed and completed within 240 days from the date of said notice. 
(4)  Land banking covenant. As a condition of approving a land bank request, the property owner shall file with the zoning administrator his unconditional agreement and covenant in a form and substance satisfactory to the village attorney. The agreement and covenant after approved [approval] by the board of trustees shall be recorded with the recorder of deeds of the county in which the property is located.

Sec. 110-6.3. - Landscaping, buffering and screening. 
    6.3.1.  Purpose and intent. In order to ensure the compatibility of different land uses, this section sets forth standards for the installation and maintenance and preservation of landscape. The visual and environmental setting of the village has an effect upon the welfare of the citizens. The promotion and control of landscaping will preserve and enhance the public health, safety and welfare of the village. These regulations are intended to minimize the harmful or nuisance effects resulting from noise, dust, debris, emissions and poor air quality, erosion, heat, motor headlight glare, the use of impervious ground material, artificial light intrusion, excessive storm water, objectionable sights or activities, or similar incompatible impacts conducted or created by adjoining or nearby land uses. 
    The standards set forth in this section are not intended to inhibit or discourage innovative design proposals. As the standards provide the minimal framework for landscape proposals, it is anticipated that they will foster and encourage creativity, innovation, and add to the natural beauty of Hanover Park. 
    6.3.2.  Scope. The regulations set forth in this section shall apply as follows: 
a.  New development: When any development involves the construction of a new building, or addition to an existing non-residential or multiple-family building, or a new single-family or two-family building. 
b.  Special use permit; variation; planned unit developments: When development of property is subject to a special use permit, a variation, or a planned unit development permit. 
c.  Intensity of use increases: The intensity of use of any existing building, structure or premises is increased through the addition of: one or more dwelling units; the gross floor area of a building is increased to require the construction of one or more additional off-street parking spaces to meet the off-street parking requirement; when there is an addition or enlargement of a building. Uses qualifying for site plan review exceptions in section 110-4.3 shall not be required to provide additional landscaping. 
d.  Expansion or reconstruction of parking areas: When any existing off-street parking area for a non-residential use is expanded or undergoes major reconstruction. Major reconstruction means removal of 50 percent or more of existing pavement within a parking area and replacement of such pavement. Resurfacing without reconstruction does not constitute major reconstruction. 
e.  Major building renovations and tenant changes: Physical improvements or change of business or tenant for non-residential uses with 10,000 square feet or more of gross floor area. Building renovations include work to the extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost of the building, to include but not be limited to, façade renovations and interior remodeling. 
f.  Reoccupation of buildings: Reoccupation of vacant freestanding non-residential single-user buildings of any size, or reoccupation of 3 or more tenants in a shopping center building, when vacant for more than 180 days. 
g.  Access and drainage changes: Any change to the access between a non-residential site and any arterial road. Any change in the grading or drainage on the site. 
h.  Freestanding sign: The installation, reconstruction, or relocation of a freestanding sign shall require landscaping or screening around such sign as defined in section 6-6.3.10. 
i.  Ground-mounted mechanical or utility equipment: Installation of ground-mounted mechanical or utility equipment shall require landscaping or screening around such equipment as defined in section 110-6.3.10. 
    Chapter 38, article XI, protection of existing trees, landscaping, and parkway grading; and chapter 102, trees and shrubs, should be referenced for general requirements for parkway trees, grading and erosion control, and treatment of diseased trees. 
    Chapter 18, article IV, property maintenance code, should be referenced for general requirements for maintenance standards for landscaping. 
    6.3.3.  Landscape plan review and approval. Landscape plans shall be reviewed and approved as directed in section 110-4.3. site plan review, and as set forth herein.

(1)  Required screening shall consist of a six foot fence or six-foot high berm, or combination thereof, as well as four shade or ornamental trees every 100 lineal feet, and 14 shrubs every 100 lineal feet. The mix of trees shall consist of one-third shade trees, one-third ornamental trees, and one-third evergreen trees. 
(2)  Screening shall be continuous along the property line. 
(3)  Berms shall be utilized to the maximum extent feasible. 

(4)  Evergreen trees and shrubs shall be used to the greatest extent feasible in a fashion so as to inhibit views from residential property. 
(5)  The surface of the landscape buffer area shall be suitably covered with grass, ground cover or similar vegetation and periodically mulched. Impervious materials such as asphalt, concrete or a layer of stone is prohibited. The landscape buffer shall not be used for the purposes of parking, loading, servicing, or storage. 
(6)  An eight-foot high masonry wall within a five-foot landscape setback area may be utilized as an alternative to meeting the minimum ten-foot width requirement. Masonry walls are subject to the regulations set forth in section 110-6.6, accessory uses and structures. 
    6.3.10.  Miscellaneous landscape requirements. 
a.  Landscaping of freestanding signs: 
(1)  Landscaping shall be installed in a minimum three-foot radius around the sign base. 
(2)  The landscaped area shall consist of plantings such as, but not limited to, shrubs, evergreens, flowering plants and ground cover plants. Landscaping bark, mulch, sod or seeded areas shall not be considered in calculating the square footage of the required landscaped area. 
b.  Landscaping and screening of mechanical and utility equipment: 
(1)  All mechanical equipment, including heating and air conditioning units, shall be screened by a semi-opaque fence, wall, or densely planted evergreen landscape planting at a maximum height sufficient to obscure such equipment from view from all adjacent streets. 
(2)  All fences installed to satisfy the screening requirement shall comply with the regulations of section 110-6.6, accessory uses and structures, and with all other applicable Code regulations. 
c.  Changes to approved landscape plan: Any change to an approved landscape plan shall require the prior approval of the zoning administrator. 
    6.3.11.  Landscape maintenance required. Property owners shall be responsible for ongoing maintenance, fertilization, repair and replacement of all vegetation, barriers and landscape planting materials, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  Replacement plantings shall be no less than the minimum required size or the size indicated in the approved landscape plan, whichever is greater. 
b.  The property owner shall make replacement plantings promptly after any plant has died but no later than 30 days after notification by the village of violation of this chapter, unless a time extension is given by the village. 
c.  Planting beds shall be initially, and thereafter periodically, filled with soil and mulched in their entirety, with shredded bark or other organic equivalent. Such material shall be contained within landscape areas and excess material outside of such areas shall be cleared on a regular basis. 
d.  Grass, sod and lawn areas shall be periodically and routinely mowed during the growing season. The grass height of any lawn area shall be as required by Village Code, chapter 54, article V, plants and weeds. 
e.  Plants shall be pruned and inspected for pests on a regular basis. 
f.  Litter shall be removed from planting areas on a regular basis. 
    6.3.12.  Variations. 
a.  A property owner may file an application for a variation when compliance with the requirements of this section for a new or pre-existing development pose a practical hardship in accordance with the procedures and standards in section 110-4.7, variations. 
b.  Additionally, application may be made to the zoning administrator for an administrative variance of no more than ten percent of any particular landscape requirement in lieu of the development commission process and village board action, provided the intent of such requirements are met and the variance otherwise meets all requirements for a variation. The application or decision concerning an administrative landscape variance shall not eliminate the potential to apply to the development commission for the same or similar variation. 
    6.3.13.  Tree preservation. 
a.  Purpose: While allowing the reasonable use and improvement of property, the village desires to preserve, protect, replace and properly maintain trees within the village and protect the public from trees which pose a threat or danger. The preservation of trees is intended to accomplish the following goals: 
(1)  Preserve trees as an important public resource, which enhance the quality of life and the general welfare; 
(2)  Preserve and enhance the village's physical and aesthetic environment; 
(3)  Enhance the air quality by filtering air pollutants; 
(4)  Reduce noise by creating a natural barrier; 
(5)  Reduce topsoil erosion through the soil retention effect of tree roots; 
(6)  Reduce stormwater runoff and the associated costs and replenish ground water supplies; and 
(7)  Protect and enhance property values. 
b.  Scope: This section 110-6.3.13 shall apply to all new and changes to existing non-residential and multiple-family construction, and new single-family and two-family construction. 
c.  Tree preservation during construction: 
(1)  Trees required or scheduled to be preserved shall be protected during construction as follows: 
(a)  Protective fencing shall encircle and be erected one foot beyond the periphery of the drip line, or as otherwise approved by a landscape professional. All fencing shall be of a rigid material such as wooden snow fencing, brightly colored plastic construction fencing, chainlink fencing, or an alternative barrier, as approved by the zoning administrator, shall be a minimum height of four feet and secured to posts driven into the ground that are spaced no more than ten feet apart. 
(b)  Protective barriers shall be in place prior to the initiation of construction and shall remain in place until construction and site work is completed. 
(c)  No materials, construction equipment or vehicles shall be stored, driven upon or parked within any drip line. 
(d)  Crushed limestone or other material detrimental to trees shall not be dumped, placed, or stored within any drip line or at a higher elevation where drainage could affect the health of the tree(s). 
(e)  The existing grade within the drip line shall not be modified and shall be maintained to the fullest extent possible. Where grade changes of four inches or more are required surrounding the drip line, a low retaining wall or other permanent tree protection technique, as may be approved by the zoning administrator, shall be used to ensure the long term health of the tree designated for preservation. 
(f)  In the event an underground utility line is to be located within five feet of a tree designated for preservation, said utility line shall be augured to prevent damage to the tree's root system. 
(2)  Methods for tree protection shall be clearly specified prior to the issuance of a building permit. If, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, such methods are not adequate to protect trees designated for preservation, a building permit shall not be issued. If during construction, adequate methods are not employed so as to protect designated trees, the zoning administrator may issue a stop work order until such time as adequate preservation methods are employed. 
(3)  If a deciduous or evergreen tree designated for preservation is damaged, razed or removed as a result of construction, such tree shall be replaced in accordance with the tree replacement section of this division. 
d.  Tree removal and replacement: The following shall apply to the removal of any tree greater than eight inches in diameter at breast height or having an aggregate diameter at breast height of 15 inches or greater: 
(1)  Such removal shall only occur for the following reasons: 
(a)  Tree is dead or dying; 
(b)  Tree is diseased; 
(c)  Tree is damaged or injured to the extent that it is likely to die, or that it constitutes a hazard to persons or property; or 
(d)  Removal of tree is consistent with good forestry practices. 
(e)  Removal of such tree is otherwise required for overall site plan, minimum landscape requirements are met, and feasible alternative design options do not exist, as approved by the zoning administrator. 
(2)  Removal of any tree greater than eight inches in diameter at breast height requires replacement of new trees with a total caliper equal to or greater than that of existing trees being removed, unless minimum landscape requirements are already met. 
(3)  Alternative tree replacement location: 
(a)  If the zoning administrator, determines that full tree replacement pursuant to the requirements of the section will result in the unreasonable crowding of trees on the lot where construction activity is taking place, or would be otherwise inconsistent with current best practices, the zoning administrator may designate that some or all of the replacement trees required be planted in the public right-of-way immediately adjacent to the lot where the construction activity is taking place. 
(b)  If the zoning administrator determines that the alternative tree replacement required by this division will result in the unreasonable crowding of trees upon the public right-of-way in accordance with current best practices, the zoning administrator may reduce the number of replacement trees to be planted immediately adjacent to the public right-of-way, and require that replacement trees be located on other nearby public rights-of-way, or other suitable locations. 
(c)  All replacement trees designated for the public right-of-way or village property shall only be of those species permitted by the village on the schedule of recommended plants, and shall be installed by the permittee. 
(4)  Payment in-lieu of tree replacement: In the event that the zoning administrator determines that the full replacement of tree as required by this section would result in unreasonable crowding of trees upon the lot where construction activity will occur, or on the immediately adjacent public right-of-way, a permittee may be allowed to pay the village a fee in lieu of making such replacement in kind. The village has no obligation to grant such a request. If the request is granted, the following regulations shall apply: 
(a)  This fee shall be equal to the tree replacement value based upon the average cost per tree inch of trees planted by the village during the previous fiscal year. 
(b)  The tree replacement fee must be received by the village within 30 days after issuance of a building permit, or the date of the damage or removal for which the replacement is required. 
(c)  The zoning administrator may issue a stop work order if a permittee fails to pay the tree replacement fee within 30 days after the date of the damage or removal for which the replacement is required. No certificate of occupancy for the property in question shall be issued until the tree replacement fee has been received by the village. 
e.  Penalties: For any tree designated for preservation that is damaged, razed or removed without the prior written approval of the zoning administrator, a monetary fine (as outlined in chapter 102, article I, section 102-12, trees and shrubs) shall be assessed upon the owner of the property on which the trees were damaged or removed. No building permits or licenses for the property shall be issued or given final approval until said charge is paid and a replacement tree plan is prepared and approved by the zoning administrator. 
(Code 1975, ch. 27, § 6.3; Ord. No. O-93-54, § 3, 9-16-1993; Ord. No. O-94-34, § 2, 7-7-1994; Ord. No. O-95-57, § 1, 9-7-1995; Ord. No. O-97-57, §§ 4, 5, 10-2-1997; Ord. No. O-04-46, § 1, 10-7-2004; Ord. No. O-14-38, § 3, 11-6-2014) 
Sec. 110-6.4. - Adverse impact performance standards. 
    The purpose of this section is to establish regulations and standards for the installation and operation of industrial uses, based upon consideration of the objectionable characteristics of such uses and the zones in which they are permitted. Further, this section is intended to prescribe procedures and methods of measurement of industrial characteristics subject to such standards. 
    Any use permitted in the L-I, B-1, B-2, BP, and HC districts, whether such use is permitted as a principal use or as accessory use, shall be subject to these standards. 
6.4.1.  Permit procedure. Before the zoning administrator issues a building permit for a use in any L-I, B-1, B-2, BP or HC districts, the applicant shall furnish sufficient information to enable the zoning administrator to assure that all performance standards and site development standards set forth in this chapter can and will be complied with all times. The zoning administrator may, in order to determine whether or not the applicant will meet such standards, require the applicant to submit the following information: 
a.  A plot plan showing the location of all present and proposed structures, drives, parking lots, waste disposal areas, bulk storage areas, streets, streams, or other significant features on or within 200 feet of the proposed site. 
b.  A description of the activity to be conducted regarding waste products, external effects or other conditions regulated herein; provided however, that the applicant shall not be required to reveal any trade secrets or sufficient detail with regard to a process that would cause any secret process of manufacturing procedure for a closely guarded proprietary compound or product to become public knowledge and be available to competitors. 
c.  The type and location of abatement devices to control, or recording instruments to measure, conformance with required standards, not including devices and instruments inherent in the manufacturing process. 
d.  Such other data and certification as may reasonably be required by the zoning administrator to reach a determination. 
All information and evidence submitted in applications to indicate conformity to performance standards shall constitute a certification and an agreement on the part of the applicant that the proposed use can and will conform to such standards at all times. 
    6.4.2.  Performance standards. In the BP, HC, L-I districts, the following regulations shall apply: 
a.  Noise. 
(1)  Maximum permitted noise levels for uses are as follows: 
TABLE 6.4-1. MAXIMUM PERMITTED SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL IN DECIBELS 
Octave Band Frequency 
(cycles per second) Maximum Decibels 
BP, HC, L-I Districts 0-74 67 75-149 59 150-299 52 300-599 46 600-1,199 40 1,200-2,399 34 2,400-4,799 32 4,800 and over 32  
(2)  Method of measurement. Sound levels shall be measured with a sound level meter and associated octave band filter and impact noise filter manufactured according to standards prescribed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Measurements shall be made using the flat network and "slow" meter response of the sound level meter. Impulsive type noises shall be subject to performance standards if those noises are capable of being accurately measured with such equipment. Noises capable of being so measured, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two decibels. Noises incapable of being measured, but objectionable because of intermittence, beat, frequency, or shrillness, shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to abutting uses. 
(3)  Exception. Nothing in this section shall apply to noises not directly under the control of the property user; noises resulting from the construction and maintenance of buildings and facilities including site preparation; noises of safety signals or warning devices; and noises of railroad or trucking equipment. 
b.  Vibration. Steady-state vibrations, for the purpose of this chapter, are vibrations that are continuous or vibrations in discrete pulses more frequent than 100 per minute. Discrete pulses that do not exceed 100 impulses per minute shall not cause displacement in excess of twice the values established in table 6.4-2 below. Impact vibrations shall mean vibrations occurring in discrete pulses separated by an interval of at least one minute and numbering no more than eight per each 24-hour period. 
(1)  Permitted vibration displacements. At no point on or beyond the boundary of any lot shall the ground-transmitted steady-state or impact vibration caused by any use or activity (except those not directly under the control of the property user) exceed the limits as established in tables 6.4-2 and 6.4-3 below for the various industrial zones and for any industrial zone boundary abutting a residential zone.

(2)  Method of measurement. For the purpose of measuring vibrations, a three-component measuring system shall be used. A three-component measuring system denotes instrumentation that can measure earth-borne vibrations in three directions each of which occurs at right angles to the other two. 
c.  Smoke and particulate matter. The emission of particulate matter from all sources within any lot containing more than five percent by weight of particles having a particle diameter larger than 44 microns is prohibited. Dust and other types of air pollution borne by the wind from such sources as storage areas, yards, and roads within the boundaries of any lot shall be kept to a minimum by appropriate landscaping, paving, or other acceptable means. Emission of particulate matter from such sources in excess of weight limitations specified herein is prohibited. The emission of smoke or particulate matter of a density equal to, or greater than No. 2 on the Ringelmann Chart is prohibited at all times, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(1)  Smoke emission. 
(a)  In the BP and HC zones, the emission of more than 12 smoke units per stack in any one hour period is prohibited. However, once during any six-hour period each stack shall be permitted up to 12 additional units in a 15-minute period for soot blowing and fire cleaning. Only during such 15-minute periods shall smoke of a density equal to, but not exceeding, no. 3 on the Ringelmann chart be permitted, and then only for fire cleaning and for not more than four minutes per period. 
(b)  In the L-I zone, the emission of more than 22 smoke units per stack in any one hour is prohibited. However, once during any three-hour period each stack shall be permitted up to 40 additional units-not to exceed Ringelmann no. 2-for soot blowing and fire cleaning. Only during fire cleaning periods, however, shall smoke of a density equal to, but not exceeding, no. 3 on the Ringelmann chart be permitted, and then for not more than four minutes per period. 
(2)  Particulate matter emission. The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed the rate established in table 6.4-4 below: 
TABLE 6.4-4. PERMITTED RATE OF PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSION IN POUNDS PER HOUR, PER ACRE

_____ 
(3)  Methods of measurement. 
(a)  Smoke: For the purpose of grading the density of emission of smoke, the Ringelmann chart, published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, shall be employed. For the purposes of determining smoke units, the Ringelmann density readings shall be made at least every minute during the period of observation. Each reading (Ringelmann number) shall be multiplied by the time in minutes for which it is observed, and the products added together to determine the total number of smoke units observed during the total period of observation. 
(b)  Particulate matter: The total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be determined as follows: Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hours from each source of emission and divide this figure by the number of acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre. Add together the individual rates of emission from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot. It is this total that shall not exceed the rate established in table 6.4-4 above. 
d.  Odors. No continuous, frequent, or repetitive emission of odors or odor-causing substances that would be offensive beyond any property line of any industrial use shall be permitted. An odor emitted no more than 15 minutes in any one day shall not be deemed as continuous, frequent, or repetitive within the meaning of these regulations. The existence of an odor shall be presumed when analysis by a competent technician demonstrates that a discernible odor is being emitted. Any process involving the creation or emission of any odors shall be provided with a primary and a secondary safeguard system so that control will be maintained if the primary safeguard system fails. All land uses shall comply with the rules and regulations of the Illinois Pollution Control Board. 
e.  Radiation hazards. The handling of radioactive materials, the discharge of such materials into air and water, and the disposal of radioactive wastes shall be in conformance with (a) the applicable regulations of the Atomic Energy Commission; and (b) the applicable regulations of any instrumentality of the State of Illinois. 
f.  Fire and explosive hazards. 
(1)  All land uses shall comply with the provisions of the Illinois Revised Statutes, and no explosives shall be stored, used or manufactured without first submitting to the zoning administrator a certificate of compliance from the Illinois Department of Mines and Minerals. 
(2)  No gasoline or other inflammables or explosives shall be stored unless the location, plans and construction conform to the laws and regulations of the village and the State of Illinois and have the approval of the state fire marshal. 
g.  Glare and Heat. Every use and activity shall be so operated that it does not emit heat or heated air beyond the boundary of the lot on which it is located. No direct or sky-reflected glare shall emanate beyond the boundary of the lot on which such use or activity is located. This restriction shall not apply to signs otherwise permitted by the provisions of this chapter or applicable ordinances, nor to activities of a temporary or of an emergency nature. Night lighting necessary for safety and the protection of property is excluded from this provision. 
h.  Electromagnetic interference. There shall be no electromagnetic interference that adversely affects the operation of any equipment other than that belonging to the creator of such interference, or that does not conform to the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission. 
    6.4.3.  Enforcement. The zoning administrator shall enforce the provisions of this section. Upon confirmation of a violation, enforcement and penalty provisions of article IV shall prevail. In addition, the zoning administrator may require of the offending industry the installation, maintenance, and operation of continuous measuring or recording instruments to demonstrate the operation and to ensure continuous compliance with the prescribed standards.

    7.5.11.  Change in nonconforming use. 
a.  A class 1 nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use. Such a change shall be permitted only when it has been reviewed by the development commission and approved by the president and board of trustees as a variation. The jurisdiction over such change, the review of proposals and approval standards and procedures shall be the same as those which are applied for variations. 
For the purpose of construing this requirement, the R-1 district shall be considered the most restrictive and the L-I district shall be considered the least restrictive. 
b.  Class 2 and class 3 nonconforming uses shall not be changed to a different nonconforming use. 
c.  Class 4 nonconforming uses shall not be changed, expanded, or extended beyond the area they occupy. 
    7.5.12.  Nonconforming parking and landscaping. When a proposed or completed repair, change in use, expansion of use, or change in structure results in nonconforming parking or landscaping, the property owner may petition for relief from the additional landscaping or parking requirement by filing a request for a variation in accordance with the procedures of this chapter. Such relief shall be granted only when it is in the interest of the village, or when conformance with the parking and landscaping requirements poses some practical difficulty or particular hardship. In determining whether there is a hardship, the development commission shall balance the cost of conformance against the detriment to the property owner and surrounding property owners that would result from failure to provide the additional parking and/or landscaping. Conditions or restrictions may be imposed by the president and board of trustees at the time any variation is granted.
