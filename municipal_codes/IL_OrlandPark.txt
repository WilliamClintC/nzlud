1-5-7-8:  ACTION ON MOTIONS:



1-5-7-8-1:  TABLING:



   An unqualified motion to lay a question on the table is not debatable,
but a motion to lay on the table and publish, or with other condition, is

on the prevailing side of the question to be reconsidered unless otherwise
provided by law; provided, however, that where a motion has received a
majority vote in the affirmative, but is declared lost solely on the ground
that a greater number of affirmative votes is required by Statute for the
passage or adoption of such motion, then in such case a motion to reconsider
may be made and seconded only by those who voted in the affirmative on such
question to be reconsidered, so long as the issue presented is the same, no

was the last preceding motion; and 5) when it has been decided that the

adjourn to a time named may be and is open to debate.



1-5-7-11:  AMENDMENT, REPEAL OR SUSPENSION OF RULES:

   The rules of parliamentary practice comprised in the latest published

Trustees in all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are not
inconsistent with the special rules of this Board of Trustees or the Statutes
or laws of the State of Illinois.



1-5-7-13:  POSTING RULES:



   The Village Clerk shall prepare and display in the Board Room of the
Village Hall a condensed digest of the provisions of the PUBLIC AND NEWS
MEDIA PARTICIPATION Section of this Chapter.  The Village Clerk shall
further post a complete copy of the PUBLIC AND NEWS MEDIA PARTICIPATION
Section of this Chapter on the bulletin board in the Village Hall.  (Ord.

1-5-7-14:  COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE:



   One hour prior to each regularly scheduled Board of Trustees meeting,
the Village Board will meet as a Committee of the Whole, unless there are no
items for the Committee of the Whole to consider. The agenda for the
Committee of the Whole shall be prepared by the Village Clerk in consultation
with the Village Manager and Village President.



   A portion of the Committee of the Whole meeting shall be dedicated to
previewing upcoming non-routine agenda items, including a standing item for
the consideration of Agenda Initiatives. A time for public comment shall be
conducted. No final action, beyond action setting future agenda items and/or
Agenda Initiatives, would be taken at a meeting of a Committee of the Whole.



   The following agenda items would be brought before the Committee of the
Whole: (1) the expenditure of money over $250,000; (2) development
agreements; (3) amending the Village Code; (4) the implementation or
modification of policies; (5) budget amendments; and/or (6) an Agenda
Initiative filed by a Board member.  Items that do not fall within these
categories, and require Board approval, are to be placed on the regular Board
of Trustees meeting agenda. The failure to preview a non-routine agenda item
at a Committee of the Whole shall not prohibit its consideration and/or
action at a future Board of Trustees meeting.



   Since the purpose of the Committee of the Whole is to allow an
opportunity to engage in more informal discussions, the rules of
parliamentary practice for standing committees comprised in the latest
published edition of Robert's "Rules of Order Revised" shall govern the
Committee of the Whole in all cases to which they are applicable, and in
which they are not inconsistent with the special rules of the Committee of
the Whole or the statutes or laws of the State of Illinois.



   Board of Trustees Agenda Initiatives: An Agenda Initiative
process would provide that any individual Trustee could get an initiative
placed on the Committee of the Whole agenda by instructing the Village
Manager, either verbally or in writing, prior to twelve o'clock (12:00) noon
on the Friday preceding the meeting, to place the item on the Committee of
the Whole agenda. Village/legal staff time would be restricted until after at
least three Trustees vote to move the Agenda Initiative forward.



   Agenda Initiatives would include: (1) the expenditure of money; (2)
modifications to the Village Code; (3) formation/modification of Village
policies; (4) the introduction of an ordinance or resolution; (5) the
formation/modification of committees; (6) budget changes; and/or (7) the
appropriation of Village/legal staff time. At each Committee of the Whole
meeting, a portion of the meeting would be dedicated to the consideration of
any Agenda Initiatives that have been filed.



(Ord. 5455, 11-18-19)



1-5-7-14-1:  PREVIOUSLY DELIBERATED ITEMS:

the Whole agenda which, in the opinion of the Village Attorney, is
substantially similar to an item or concerns subject matter which is the same
as an item that was previously defeated by the Board of Trustees or the
Committee of the Whole, respectively, for a period of one (1) year after the
item was defeated unless:



      1.   The rules are suspended by a majority of the members of
the Board of Trustees or the Committee of the Whole; or



      2.   A matter is moved to be reconsidered by a majority of the
members of the Board of Trustees or the Committee of the Whole.

   In order to secure the rights of the citizens of the Village to a fair
and just representation of all the citizens by their elected officials, and
to guarantee those duly elected officials an orderly and dignified forum in
which to represent the rights of the said citizens, and to safeguard the

no person or persons will be allowed to engage in any activity that will
disturb or disrupt the orderly proceedings of the Board of Trustees and for
the attaining of this objective, the following provisions are hereby adopted
and the following rules of conduct are hereby established:

Board Room of the Village Hall to be divided into three (3) sections, as
follows:



      (1).   One section for the seating of the Board of Trustees,

members of advisory boards and commissions of the Village, which shall be
distinctly designated.



      (2).   One section furnished with sufficient tables or desks

      (3).   One section furnished with chairs for all other persons
constituting the audience at said meeting.



   2.   No alcoholic beverages in any form or other intoxicating
substance shall be permitted during the time of the meeting of the Board of
Trustees.



   3.   No person, other than members of the Board of Trustees, the

members of advisory boards and commissions of the Village will be permitted
to enter the section of the main meeting room set aside for the members of

unless permission is granted by the presiding officer.  Any person or

or after the close of the meeting of the Board of Trustees.



   4.   Members of the audience and members of the news media,
including photographers, will not be permitted free movement about the
meeting room during the time of the meeting of the Board of Trustees.  Any
member of the audience and any member of the news media, including
photographers, may enter and leave the meeting room at any time, provided
such entrance and exit is made quietly and in an orderly fashion.  If a
photographer must move about the room, such movement shall be allowed,
provided it is minimal, does not obstruct the view of any other person in
physical attendance, and the photographer does not enter the section
designated for the members of the Board of Trustees and others as set forth
in this Section.



   5.   Members of the audience or members of the news media will not
engage in conversation during the time of the meeting of the Board of
Trustees.

Sections 140/1, et seq., of the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS
140/1, et seq.).  The recordings shall be maintained by the Village Clerk
and disposed of in accordance with the Illinois Local Records Act (50 ILCS
205/1, et seq.).  The recordings will be posted on the Village website on
the first business day following each recorded Village Board or Committee
meeting.



      Whenever the Village Board sits as a tribunal or conducts a
hearing at which witnesses are to testify, and a witness asserts his/her
right under state or federal law, as now or hereafter may be applicable, to
refuse  to testify if the proceedings are to be recorded, the Village
President or presiding officer shall order and direct that all such recording
cease during the testimony of the witness, and the Village President or
presiding officer shall enforce such order by all lawful means.



      Persons attending an open and public meeting of the Village Board
or any of its Standing Committees, Commissions, Agencies and Advisory Boards
may, at their own expense, record the proceedings with an audio, video, still
or motion picture device or may broadcast the proceedings.  In this
instance, if the Village Board (or the governing board of a Village
Committee, Commission, Agency or Advisory Board) finds by a majority vote
that the recording or broadcast cannot continue without noise, illumination
or obstruction of view that constitutes or would constitute a persistent
disruption of the proceedings, any such person shall be directed by the
Village President or presiding officer to discontinue recording or
transmitting.



   7.   Persons wishing to address the Board of Trustees at the time
allotted by the Board of Trustees for public discussion shall make this

   9.   The Board of Trustees, herein defined to include its
Committees, Commissions and Advisory Boards, of the Village of Orland Park
welcomes public participation and will hear any interested individual
pursuant to the guidelines outlined in this policy.  Before appearing before
the Board, the members of the public are urged to seek solutions to their
concerns through administrative channels.  If there are no members of the
public wishing to address the Board, the Board may continue with its meeting.



      The following rules shall govern speakers who address the Board:

      (5).   Board members may or may not respond to comments from
speakers.  The Village President or other presiding officer may respond as
appropriate and, for example, direct speakers to the appropriate staff member
for assistance.  Issues requiring possible action by the Board may be added
to a future agenda.  Issues that may need to be addressed by the
administration will be duly noted.



      (6).   Abusive language and/or personal attacks will not be
permitted and shall promptly be ruled out of order by the Village President
or other presiding officer.



      (7).   Speakers at special meetings shall limit their topics
to matters appearing on the special meeting agendas.

authority to terminate the remarks of speakers who fail to adhere to the
above rules.



All public comment shall be addressed to the Board as a whole and no comments
shall be addressed to individual members of the Board, Village staff or other
members of the public.



There shall be no debate on any matters raised during public comment.  The
Board may, however, refer any matter of public comment to the Village
Manager, Village staff, an appropriate agency for review, or may place the
matter on a subsequent agenda for discussion.



No final action may be taken on any public comment or concern which requires
an ordinance, resolution, or written contract, or which has the effect of
approving any expenditure of funds.  The Board may, however, direct that any
matter raised on these subjects be set for a future agenda, including the
preparation of ordinances, resolutions or other documents for consideration
at such time.

order for goods and services, the cost of which is less than $10,000.00 and

relations will insure reasonable, responsible, orderly and an uninterrupted
operation of government service for the benefit of Village residents.



   As with any process, there are several roles which contribute to the
result.  In this process there are three (3) major roles: the Board of
Trustees, the Village Manager, and the employees.

department and division heads.



   As part of his duties, the Village Manager has the responsibility to

occupational category fail to designate a representative, the Village Manager
may designate a full time employee member of an occupational category to be a
representative to the Wage and Benefit Committee.  The Village Manager's
designation of a representative in the absence of an elected representative
from an occupational group is to insure the presence of someone from each
group so that there can be a flow of information regarding wages and benefits.



   Prior to November 1 of each year, the Village Manager and his designees
shall prepare a tentative schedule for meeting at least once with each
occupational category; and after such meeting the representatives of the
occupational categories (Wage and Benefit Committee) will from time to time,
meet with the Village Manager and his designee(s) to discuss the status of
wages and benefits.



1-9-5:  FUNCTION OF WAGE AND BENEFIT COMMITTEE:



   From time to time as necessary, the representatives of the occupational
categories (Wage and Benefit Committee) shall meet, individually or as a
group, with the Village Manager and designee(s) for the purpose of discussing
wages and benefits and utilizing the wage determination process.



   The occupational category representatives and the Village Manager will
meet and review information relating the market comparability information
used by the Village in analyzing wages and benefits.  Basically, the
Committee's scope of review shall include but are not limited to the Regional
Governmental Salary and Fringe Benefit Survey by the Cook County Bureau of
Administration Position Classification Agency, published semi- annually for
market evaluation, and the review of other chosen municipalities' market
information and the determination of benchmarks for positions within the
occupational categories of the Village.



1-9-6:  WAGE DETERMINATION:



   The job descriptions within an occupational category will be compared
to the descriptions from the sample municipalities agreed to by the Village
Manager.  When a job description from the Village and another or other
communities substantially match, then a benchmark for that position is
identified.  The average maximum rate of pay for that position shall be
determined by adding the maximum rate of pay for that benchmark and dividing
that number by the number of communities for that benchmark.  Thus, an
average maximum rate of pay results for that type of position.  The average
maximum rate of pay shall be compared to the Village's maximum rate of pay
for that benchmark position and an average dollar adjustment due that
benchmark will be derived.  The average adjustment due each benchmark within
an occupational category shall be totaled, and an average shall be derived
for an overall market adjustment for those positions that are not
benchmarked.  This is necessary because there may be no position or job
description within the occupational category that can be benchmarked with the
sample communities.



1-9-7:  REPORT TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES:



   The Village Manager will periodically throughout his discussions with
the Wage and Benefit Committee relating to wages and benefits review the
status of said discussions with the President and Board of Trustees.



   Once discussions are completed between the Village Manager and the
occupational categories, the Village Manager shall be authorized to sign
agreements with each occupational category.



   Agreements ratified by the corporate authorities, shall be binding upon
the Village and the employees as to benefit and wage terms contained therein
and for the time period specified therein, unless modified in writing by both
parties to the said agreement.



1-9-8:  RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND DISAGREEMENTS:



   The procedure for the resolution of disputes and disagreements
concerning wages and benefits found in the AFSCME contract on file in the
Office of the Village Clerk shall be followed for all Village employees,
unless another contract is applicable.

1-12-1:  BOND ISSUANCE GUIDELINES:



   The President and Board of Trustees as a general policy will favorably
consider issuing commercial or industrial revenue bonds to qualified
businesses and industries upon the assurance that the taxpayers are fully
protected and the affirmation that the business or industry will benefit the
Village.  To insure the carrying out of these general policies, the
following guidelines and criteria are hereby established:



   1.   Applications for commercial or industrial revenue bonds shall
be made to the Village Manager in the form prescribed by the Village
Manager.  The application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of one
thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) and such supporting financial
documents and information as is necessary to make a complete and thorough
analysis of the business or industry.  Information requested shall include:



      (1).   Name of the firm that will purchase the bonds, (if
available).



      (2).   A SEC. 10-K report of the corporation if it is required
to file.



      (3).   The last five (5) annual reports of the corporation.

current fiscal year, if available.

preparation of all ordinances, resolutions, agreements and other legal and
financial documents that are necessary to authorize and deliver the
commercial or industrial revenue bonds, shall be at the expense of the
applicant, but may be financed as part of the bonded project.



   3.   Applicant shall contract for the sale of the bonds at terms
agreeable to the applicant and his bank or investment banker.  (Ord. 1114,
9-28-81)



   4.   The fee to the Village for authorizing the issuance of
commercial or industrial revenue bonds, whether a new issue or a refunding of
a previous issue, shall be an amount agreed upon by the Village Manager and
applicant, provided, however, that said total fee shall, in no event, be
greater than permitted by law at the time of issuance such that said bonds
will become arbitrage bonds.  The fee set forth in this subsection shall be
in addition to all other fees, costs and expenses of issuance set forth in
this Chapter.  (Ord. 1601, 10-27-86)



   5.   Before the Village issues commercial or industrial revenue
bonds, the President and Board of Trustees will require the following
statements:

reviewed or will review all documents pertinent to the application and bond
issue.



      (2).   A statement from the financial consultant of the
Village that, based on the consultant's study of the information supplied and
from other available sources, nothing has come to his attention to indicate
that: (a) the applicant is not in a position to undertake its commitments or
(b) it is inadvisable for the Village to lend its name to the proposed
project even though it is not undertaking any financial obligations.  The
financial consultant of the Village shall also state the amount of any fee he
will charge for his services payable by the applicant and to be included as
part of the estimate of cost of the bond issue.



      (3).   A statement from the Plan Commission that the business
or industry is in compliance with the Comprehensive Plan of the Village and
that the business or industry would be an asset to the Village.



      (4).   A statement from the Village Comptroller and Village
Manager that suitable arrangements have been made for the payment of all fees.



      (5).   A statement from the Village Manager that he has
reviewed all documents and recommends to the President and Board of Trustees
that they authorize the issuance of the commercial or industrial revenue
bonds.



      (6).   The President and Board of Trustees reserve the right
to have the applicant appear before them to explain the proposed development
and to answer any questions.

1-13-4:     ADDITIONAL USES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOAN PROGRAM FUNDS:



   Funds currently available and designated for the Economic Development
Loan Program may be utilized and expended for economic development purposes,

(Ord. 5118, 8-15-16; Amd. Ord. 5204, 7-17-17)



1-13-5:     ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REVOLVING LOAN FUND:



   The Village of Orland Park's Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund
(RLF) was established in 1987 as an incentive for targeted businesses to
locate or expand in the Village.



   Maximum loan amounts are received on a case by case basis. Interest is
charged at half of prime rate at either the time a complete application is
received or at closing, whichever rate is lower at the time the closing
papers are prepared. Legal and financial-analysis fees for loan initiation
only incurred by the Applicant are paid by the Village, however, all other
loan closing costs will be deducted from final loan disbursement.



   Requests for loans are evaluated by the Village's Economic Development
Advisory Board (EDAB) against public policy objectives established for the
RLF program, including the level of private investment, job creation, and new
tax generation. Eligible projects include acquisition of real property,
installation of utility infrastructure, construction or expansion of
commercial or industrial buildings, and purchase of equipment. Funds for
construction activities are available as a permanent loan upon completion of
construction. Village funds are not available for working capital. 



(Ord. 5204, 7-17-17)



1-13-6: QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND:



   To be eligible for a loan, a project must meet all of the following
minimum qualifications:



   1.   The funds must be used for the purchase or construction of
fixed assets such as land, buildings, and capital equipment. Funds cannot be
used for working capital. Refinancing an existing RLF loan will be considered
only when there is substantial benefit to the Village or if the applicant can
demonstrate that a hardship exists.



   2.   The project must be located within the Village limits of Orland
Park. Preference is given to non-retail projects located in designated
industrial areas.



   3.   The project must create or retain permanent office, industrial,
warehouse, distribution, or related jobs.



   4.   The developer or company must demonstrate firm lender and
equity commitments, sign a letter of commitment regarding investment and job
creation, and cooperate with Village staff and the EDAB.



   5.    Office, industrial, warehouse, distribution, and related
businesses are given preference in reviewing loan requests. Retail
establishments and restaurants will be considered but are given second
priority.



   6.   The applicant must be able to demonstrate that the project
would not be feasible without the Village loan. The project must not begin
until the loan is given final approval by the Village Board or a preliminary
Resolution of Intent is approved by the EDAB; commencement of the project
prior to approval will disqualify the loan request from consideration.



   7.   The benefit to the Village in the form of tax dollars, jobs, or
other measures must be significant enough to warrant Village participation. 



(Ord. 5204, 7-17-17)



1-13-7:  REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION:



   Once a completed application has been received, the loan request will
be scheduled for consideration at the next regularly scheduled EDAB meeting.
Meetings are generally held once every quarter at Orland Park's Village Hall.



   In reviewing the merits of the request, the EDAB gives consideration to
the following factors:



   1.    The enhancement of the overall tax base, including property
taxes returned to the Village.



   2.    Diversification of the property tax base through construction
of new office, industrial, warehouse, distribution, and related facilities.



   3.   A tax revenue/return analysis that insures the tax burden for
residents will be favorable.



   4.   Encouragement of private investment through these public loan
dollars.



   5.   Location of projects within areas of the Village targeted for
industrial and commercial growth.



   6.   Creation or retention of quality full-time permanent jobs over
the course of the project and beyond.



   7.    Adequate credit worthiness of the loan.



   8.   Conformance of the project to Village land use and economic
development goals, policies, and objectives. 



(Ord. 5204, 7-17-17)



1-13-8:  APPROVAL OF LOAN REQUEST:



   Following review of the application, the EDAB will make a
recommendation to the Board of Trustees to approve or deny the loan. If a
request receives preliminary approval from the EDAB, a preliminary approval
letter will be mailed to the applicant, stating the level of funding and any
conditions of the loan. If the request is not approved, the applicant will be
provided with an explanation of what changes should be made for
reconsideration, or an indication that the application will receive no
further consideration by the EDAB.



   The loan request, along with the EDAB's recommendation, will be
forwarded to the Village Board of Trustees, who will make a final
determination to approve or deny the loan request at a regular Board meeting.
The project must not commence until the Village Board gives final approval
for the loan or the EDAB grants preliminary approval of a Resolution of
Intent.

Introduction



   The proposed Orland Park-Economic Development Strategy details a number
of steps to enhance market penetration of Orland Park in order to stimulate
job creation and private investment.  The strategy is particularly oriented
to encourage investment in specifically designated geographical areas and
types of business activity as determined by the Advisory Board of Trustees. 
The first step in the overall strategy is the creation of the Economic
Development Loan Program.  The above is patterned (basically) after the
successful federal program - the Urban Development Action Grant Program
(UDAG).  Administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
the UDAG program allows for the creation of public-private partnerships to
induce job creation and investments.  As such, private dollars must be in
place in order for the public funds to be committed to the project.



   The use of public monies for this Economic Development Loan  Program
serves three critical purposes:



   1.   Provides a ready and visible source of funds for encouraging
investment in the Village by developers and industries.



   2.   Improves tax base through increased investments, payrolls, and
spin-off investments.



   3.   Demonstrates strong local economic development capacity.



   Proper utilization of currently unrestricted funds of the Village
enables Orland Park to leverage such monies in a manner determined by program
criteria similar to the UDAG program.  As a result, Village participation
will be contingent upon the private developer/firm committing to a certain
level of investment, job creation, and operation.  Evidence of the above
would be furnished by the developer/firm; while complemented by analysis of
staff and the review of evidentiary materials submitted - in order to
determine conformance with village policy and program objectives - the
decision would be made by the Economic Development Advisory Board and,
finally, the Advisory Board of Trustees as to the funding of the individual
projects.



OBJECTIVES OF ORLAND PARK'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOAN PROGRAM



Tax Base



   The use of public monies is directly related to tax base.  Every
effort will be made to insure that the expenditure of Village funds results
in increased private investment.  The increased investment is expected to
generate revenues in the form of new real estate taxes, sales tax, and
repayment of revolving loans.  In short, the Village's concern will be to
develop practical and effective approaches to stimulating capital investment
that enlarges the tax base.  The broadened tax base is necessary to maintain
and expand essential public services, sustain Orland Park communities and
neighborhoods, and general infrastructure necessary to a healthy economy.



Jobs



   Jobs are and will be one of the main objectives.  The Program will
seek to retain private sector jobs in the Village, to foster and sustain job
growth in industrial concerns to attract new firms to the Village, and to
help firms within Orland Park expand their business opportunities.



Enhance Development in Key Sectors of the Village



   The Advisory Board of Trustees desires to optimize utilization of
Village land ways that complement overall policy objectives of the Village. 
In particular, the Village has acquired a large parcel of land upon which
certain municipal facilities will be erected and is desirous of promoting
complemental private uses of residual portions of the land - uses which will
provide additional taxes to defray operating costs of municipal services and
uses which will result in achievement of a long-term objective of this area
becoming a true "Village Center".  Additionally, the Village has identified
certain other strategically located areas whose potential for industrial
and/or commercial/office development is significant and desires to see such
areas developed in accordance with standards which meet overall Village
objectives.



Self-Sufficiency



   The Village recognizes that Federal and State monies, once available to
assist in private development efforts, have been significantly constrained. 
In order to control its own destiny and assure residents of quality
development, the Village views the Economic Development Loan Program as a
mechanism to assist in continuing strong and desired development.  In this
respect, the Village will be better able to control its own destiny - without
requiring dependence on dwindling Federal or State monies.



APPROACH TO ORLAND PARK'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT LOAN PROGRAM



Overview



   To be successful in meeting these key objectives, Orland Park must
prepare to compete in an increasingly difficult economic environment. 
Elements of the program must address both actual cost factors for business
and the perceptions which surround capital investment and real estate for the
longer run.  This means that the program must aim at enlisting the private
sector, not solely in form of civic duty, but in business interest.



Advantages Which Orland Park Has Vis-a-Vis Its Surrounding Environment



   Orland Park brings to the economic competition some significant
advantages which will enable it to impact substantially upon the local
economy; namely:



   ·    its powers as a home rule unit of government under Illinois 
law;



   ·    strong private sector interest and participation;



   ·    strong ties with the local financial community;



   ·    the formation of an Economic Development Advisory Board;



   ·    the creation of a Special Service area;



   ·    an experienced staff Economic Development Director;



   ·    efforts of the Village President and Trustee to demonstrate
visible leadership; and



   ·    willingness to improve business climate.



   Much of the work necessary to implement such a program has  already 
been initiated or put in process by the Village, its staff, and its
consultants.



Visible Results, A Program with Early Successes



A vital element in launching a program which captures the confidence of the
private sector is that the program bring early and visible results.  This
means that we must concentrate scarce development resources, and sufficiently
target such resources to gain early program success.



   Clearly, such achievements will affect the perception of investors,
lenders and development specialists who can begin to see strong market
advantage to an Orland Park location.



   A key element of the overall development strategy then is the
development of a positive market psychology.  With sufficiently well-defined
targets, the Village is confident that it can spur business investment at a
large enough scale to gain major development momentum.



CREATION AND ORGANIZATION OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM



Creation of the Revolving Loan Finance Program



Overall Goal:  Maximize private investment in conjunction with leveraged
public resources.



Specific Objectives:



    Objective 1:  Provide a ready and visible source of funds for
developers and industries.



    Objective 2:  Improve tax base through increased investment, payroll,
and spin-off investments.



    Objective 3:  Demonstrate a strong local economic development capacity
as well as an aggressive public sector interest in business investment and
job creation.



   The Economic Development Advisory Board will prepare
regulations/criteria as ell as procedures for evaluating proposals presented
to it.  The Advisory Board will review proposals in light of eligible costs
and activities as contained in the regulations.  A project's ability to
generate new taxes or repayment of Village loans will be ranked in relation
to other projects, as well as other criteria (location in designated areas,
creation of jobs, etc.). The process provides a new finance vehicle that can
be utilized by businesses wishing to expand or locate in Orland Park.  In
addition, the plan is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of business
needs, expansion, relocation, machinery and equipment purchase.



Orland Park Economic Development Advisory Board



Overall Goal:  Use local resources as well as linkages to development
programs to improve capital access for firms located or expanding in Orland
Park.



Specific Objectives:



    Objective 1:  Develop a review mechanism to evaluate development
proposals pertaining to the Revolving Loan Program.



    Objective 2:  Develop an inventory of available economic development
incentives to increase availability of capital for businesses.



    Objective 3:  Coordinate and program incentives and capital to
designated areas of the Village.



   The Advisory Board will initially review and evaluate proposals
submitted under the Revolving Loan Program.  Through its linkages to the
private sector, the Advisory Board is well-positioned to be aware of firms
that wish to expand, relocate within, or locate in the Village.  The
Advisory Board can expect to leverage its resources through:



   ·    Combinations of finance incentives such as Industrial Revenue
Bonds or SBA 7(a) and 503 loan programs.  The Advisory Board can recommend
the use of such incentives to be used in conjunction with Village resources
or as an alternative. (The firm would be responsible for application
preparation).



   ·    Implementation of projects that are acceptable to the
Advisory Board and provide a highly visible marketing tool.



   ·    Providing business-oriented solutions to interested firms. 
The Advisory Board is composed of highly respected public and private
officials that offer a company an opportunity to directly communicate with
the Village government, business organizations, the finance community, and
other Orland Park businessmen at one time.



Formulation of Incentives to Firms and Developers



Overall Goal:  Utilize existing and planned program resources and
inducements to focus on development objectives.



Specific Objectives:



    Objective 1:  Provide an approach that responds to business needs and
bottom line savings.



    Objective 2:  Maximize local resources as well as other available
public resources to leverage private investments.



    Objective 3:  Create positive market momentum in designated areas with
visible program implementation.



   The Advisory Board will focus some early attention on the development
of incentives for Village defined designated areas - for which maximum
efforts for assistance from multiple resources will be appropriate.

   V.   Criteria For Selection:



      1.   General



         Loan assistance will be made available in order to achieve
the greatest conformance to public program and policy objectives.  To be
considered for project selection, a proposal must - at the minimum - have a
firm private commitment (equity/private lender funds) of 2.0 private dollars,
unless the Village Board makes a specific finding of necessity for a lower
ratio.  To 1.0 public dollars.  If other public funding is required, this
amount will not enter into the leverage ratio, but firm public commitments
are necessary to be considered for loan assistance.  (Ord. 4464, 2-16-09)



      2.   Requirements which must be met to be considered for loan
assistance



         a.   A firm private commitment - No projects will be
funded unless there is a firm private commitment to finance and carry out the
project. The private commitment must have a clear, direct relationship to the
activities for which funding is being requested.



         b.   Leveraging ratio - Each project considered for
selection for funding must have a leveraging ratio of at least 2.0 to 1.0. 
Unless the village board makes a specific finding of necessity for a lower
ratio.  (Ord. 4464, 2-16-09)



      c.   A firm commitment of public resources - If a project
requires a commitment of other public resources, then it must be a firm
public commitment.



      d.   Project costs will include, for purposes of computing the
leverage ratio:



         ·    Fixed assets (land, building, improvements,
capital equipment).



         ·    New private investments, contingent upon Village
participation.



         ·    Projects within the-corporate boundaries of
Village.



      e.   The amount of the leveraging ratio - In selecting
projects for funding, the Village will consider whether the amount of private
leverage to be generated by a given project is greater than that of other
projects.  In other words, the higher the leveraging ratio, the more likely
it is that the project will be selected for preliminary approval.  Recapture
of Village funds for a second use increases the private leverage thereby
making a project more competitive.  The minimum leveraging ratio is 2.0 to
1.0 (private dollars to public dollars), unless the Village Board makes a
specific finding of necessity for a lower ratio.  (Ord. 4464, 2-16-09)



      f.   The impact of the proposed project on the fiscal base of
the community  - The fiscal impact of the proposed project will be measured
by the annualized increase in real estate and other taxes such as corporate,
sales or income taxes accruing to the Village as a result of the project's
implementation.  In selecting projects for funding, the Village will
consider whether a given project will generate a greater amount of net new
annual tax revenues in relationship to the requested public finds amount than
other projects.



      g.   The impact of the proposed project on the physical
conditions of the community - The Advisory Board will assess the impact of
each project in relation to other uses within the Village.



      h.   The impact of the proposed project on the economic
conditions of the community - The creation of new jobs, payroll, and jobs
retained.



      i.   The likelihood of accomplishing the project in a timely
fashion within the total resources which will be provided - Events such as
the status of land assembly, zoning permits, any necessary historic or
environmental clearances will be considered.  The Village requires projects
to be completed within a two-year period from the date of announcement of
preliminary funding approval.



   VI.   Village Review and Action on Applications



      1.   Economic Development Advisory Board

SAMPLE BORROWER COMMITMENT



____________________, 1987



   Subject to the Village's participation of $__________________ per the
Business Finance Plan, the undersigned agree to the following investments as
described:



(The Borrower would list the:



    -- location of the project



    -- control of the site



    -- project costs and proposed sources of funds, all identified
clearly.  Also include terms of repayment if               
revolving loan fund used).



   As a result of the development described above, the undersigned will
commit its best efforts to create (retain) jobs over a month/year period (a
brief explanation of the rationale for projections is to be included).



   The Village participation is necessary for the borrowing reason(s).



    (the reasons for the Village participation must be included as well as
an attached application that contains        all necessary project
information).



   The undersigned is willing to sign a legally binding commitment upon

   As title of the signator, the undersigned has the authority to commit
the organization.  As a result of the receipt of the Village funds in an
amount of $______________________________the above described investments, job
creation and operations month period would occur within the Village of Orland

   EXHIBIT 2



   WEIGHTING CRITERIA/REVIEW MECHANISM



Evidence of Meeting



Public Policy Objectives



   The enclosed form is a review mechanism for determining the priorities
of various projects submitted to the Village by developers or firms.  The
form is a scoresheet whereby each project would be rated numerically on the
basis of meeting program and public policy objectives.  Basic public policy
objectives are:



   I.   The improvement of the overall tax base (property taxes, sales
and income taxes returned to the Village).



   Il.   A tax revenue/return analysis that insures the tax burden for
residents will be favorable.



   III.   The leverage of private dollars and investments by public
dollars.



   IV.   Location within designated areas.



   V.   New jobs created over the course of the project.



   If the individual project were to meet all objectives completely (on
the basis of a high evaluation score), Village funds would be able to be
applied to the project - given the developer/firm's request and willingness
to enter into legally binding commitments.  If a project did not meet any of
the above objectives, or did so minimally, no participation or a reduced
level of participation would be recommended.



Priority Score                         Ranking



   High                            TopTier - Preferred
projects



(75-100 pts.)



   Moderate                    Middle Tier - Given limited
resources



(25-74 pts.) 



   Low                            Bottom Tier - Marginal
projects,



(0-24 pts.)                              less return with
respect to Village objectives



   Basically, the scores represent priority rankings among alternative
projects.  Only Top Tier and Middle Tier projects would be acceptable to the
Village based upon their relative ranking.  The major criteria area of
concern will relate to repayment of the Village proceeds.  Secondary ranking
criteria are concerned with job creation or retention and location in
designated areas.  The Economic Development Loan Program recognizes the
importance of development projects. but requires that the use of Village
funds be as fiscally responsible as possible.  Projects which can produce a
substantial tax increment or repay loan proceeds are rewarded with more
points, allowing them to move into the top tier.



Basis Program Qualifications



   1.   The eligible project costs are restricted to:



      ·    fixed assets (land, building, capital equipment)



      ·    new private investments



      ·    projects within the corporate boundaries of Orland Park



   2.   (a)  How permanent jobs are created as a result of the
project; or



      (b)  Jobs are retained by the project.



   3.   Focus will be on designated areas:



      ·    Village Center Complex



      ·    Industrial and Office Development in the Southwest
Sector



   Points outside of the designated areas will be eligible, but in order
to obtain maximum leverage of resources, these areas will be highlighted.



   4.   The developer/firm demonstrates: 



      ·    firm lender and equity commitments



      ·    a letter of commitment re: Job creation, investments



      ·    cooperation with Village staff and the Economic
Development Advisory Board



   5.   The return of the Village in the form of either tax dollars,
jobs or other measures must be significant to warrant Village participation.



   As a minimum, each project would have to meet the above objectives in
order to qualify for the Economic Development Loan Program.  Should a
project meet the objectives, review utilizing this form, and other supporting
data, would commence.

1-14-1:  PURPOSE; RESERVATION OF RIGHT; AUTHORITY:



   The purpose of this Chapter is to provide a fair and efficient method
of enforcing the Village's regulations through administrative adjudication of
charges of non-vehicular violations of the Village Code.  All provisions of
the Village Code may be enforced through the administrative adjudication
system, provided the system shall have no authority to impose a penalty of
incarceration or adjudicate an offense under the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code
which is a traffic regulation governing moving vehicles, or to impose a fine
in excess of $50,000.00.  The Village reserves its right to employ all other
means and methods available under the law to enforce its Village Code,
including direct application to the Courts.



   Section 1-2.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-2) allows
home rule municipalities to provide by ordinance for a system of
administrative adjudication of municipal code violations to the extent
permitted by the Illinois Constitution.  The Village is a home rule
municipality.  The Illinois Constitution provides that a home rule unit may
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and
affairs (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(a)(1970)).  The Illinois
Constitution also provides that a home rule unit may exercise and perform
concurrently with the State any power or function of a home rule unit to the
extent that the General Assembly by law does not specifically limit the
concurrent exercise or specifically declare the State's exercise to be
exclusive (Illinois Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 6(i)(1970)).  The Illinois
Constitution further provides that the powers and functions of home rule
units shall be construed liberally.



1-14-2:   ADMINISTRATIVE COMPOSITION:



   The system of administrative adjudication of non-vehicular regulations
violations shall be composed of a Code Hearing Unit which shall be comprised

      6.   Preserve and authenticate the record of the hearing and
all exhibits and evidence introduced at the hearing.

   A.   Enforcement - Upon expiration of the period in which judicial
review under the Illinois Administrative Review Law may be sought for a final
determination of a Village Code violation unless stayed by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the findings, decision and order of the Hearing
Officer may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment entered by a court
of competent jurisdiction.



   B.   Court Costs, Attorneys' Fees and Costs of Collection - In any
case in which a person has failed to comply with a Hearing Officer's judgment
ordering the correction of a Village Code violation or imposing any fine or
other sanction as a result of a Village Code violation, any expenses incurred
by the Village to enforce the judgment, including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees, court costs, and costs related to property demolition or 
foreclosure, after they are fixed by a court of competent jurisdiction or by

memorandum of judgment, recorded pursuant to Section B.2. above, may be
released upon payment to the Village of the judgment amount and, subject to

   Sidewalks and driveway aprons shall be cured by one of the following
methods:



   1.   Burlap shall be placed on the finished surface, saturated with
water and covered with an impermeable covering.



   2.   Polyethylene sheeting shall be placed as soon as the concrete
has sufficiently hardened to prevent marring of the surface.  The surface of
the concrete shall be wet immediately before the sheeting is placed.  The
edges of the sheeting shall be weighted securely with a continuous windrow of
earth or any other means satisfactory to the Building Department to provide
an air tight cover.



   3.   Specified curing compound shall be applied with brush, roller,
or spray at the rate of one (1) gallon for every two hundred fifty (250)
square feet of surface.  Any of the above curing methods must remain in
place for not less than six (6) days.



3-4-3-9:  BACKFILL:



   After the concrete has been cured, forms shall be removed and the space
near the edges of the sidewalk or driveway apron shall be backfilled to the
required elevation with material approved by the Building Department.  The
material shall then be compacted until firm and the surface evenly graded.

   Surplus or waste material resulting from the sidewalk or driveway apron
construction shall be disposed of by the developer/owner.



3-4-3-11:  CONTROL OF MATERIALS:



   The developer/owner shall, when requested b the Village and at his
expense, have a commercial testing laboratory prepare and test samples of
delivered concrete.  One (1) set of tests shall be taken for the first
twenty-five (25) cubic yards, or fraction thereof, and one (1) set of tests
shall be taken for each additional fifty (50) cubic yards.  A set of tests
shall consist of four (4) standard cylinders (two (2) shall be broken at
seven (7) days and two (2) shall be broken at twenty-eight (28) days), one
(1) slump test and one (1) air content test.  The laboratory shall perform
tests in accordance with recognized ASTM standards and shall submit written
reports of such tests to the Village Engineer for review.



3-4-4:  SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT, REPAIR AND INSTALLATION:



3-4-4-1:  COST-SHARING REPLACEMENT:



   There is hereby established a sidewalk replacement program for the
purposes of providing for the replacement of sidewalks in need of repair and
for the payment of the cost thereof in equal portions by the Village and the
participating owner or owners of the properties which front upon such
sidewalks or are adjacent to the public right of way upon which such
sidewalks are located.



3-4-4-2:  DETERMINATION:



   The Director of Public Works or his designee shall be the final
authority in determining which sections of sidewalks or portions thereof are
in need of repair or replacement.



   A.   Sections of sidewalk which are structurally sound but found to
contain one of the following conditions will be found to be in need of repair
and eligible for replacement based upon equal payment by Village and the
participating owner or owners:



      (1)   Surface crumbling which covers in excess of 25% of the
surface area of an identified section of sidewalk; and



      (2)   Surface pitting of a 1/2" depth or more which covers in
excess of 75% of the surface area of an identified portion of sidewalk.



   B.   Sections of sidewalk which are found by the Director of Public
Works or his designee to be in need of repair and replacement because they
meet the following conditions shall be repaired solely at Village expense:



      (1)   Vertical separation which exceeds 3/4" between adjoining
pieces or sections of sidewalk; and



      (2)   Extensive misalignment or sloping of sidewalk that
creates hazardous conditions.



   Under no circumstances other than said vertical separation or extensive
misalignment may the Director of Public Works determine that sidewalks are to
be repaired or replaced solely at Village expense.



3-4-4-3:  NOTICE, AGREEMENT, PAYMENT:



   Once a section or specific section of sidewalk is determined to be in
need of repair, the Director of Public Works or his designee shall send
written notification of his finding to the owner or owners of the properties
fronting upon a section of sidewalk, or adjacent to the public right of way
whereon the sidewalk in need of repair is located.  The notice shall include
the amount of sidewalk involved, the property owner's portion of the cost of
repair or replacement and instructions on how to pay the Village before
repair or replacement work is started. 



   If a property owner or owners fail to remit to the Village their share
of the cost of repairing or replacing a section or sections of sidewalk
within twenty (20) days of the date of notification from the Village, the
Village will abandon the project. 



3-4-4-4:  TIMING:



   When sections of sidewalk are determined to be in need of repair or
replacement, and after any property owner's share of the cost has been paid,
the Village will begin repair work as soon as reasonably possible without
being charged a short load fee by the concrete carrier.



3-4-4-5:  FAILURE OF OWNER TO REPAIR:



   If a property owner fails or refuses to agree to share the cost of
replacing a sidewalk in need of repair within twenty (20) days of the date of
the notice, the Village may perform such work as is minimally necessary to
alleviate the deteriorated condition.  Further, the Director of Code
Enforcement shall maintain a list of all property owners who elect not to
participate in the program.



3-4-4-6:  NEW SIDEWALKS:



   The cost of construction of new sidewalks which have not been built and
which are required in existing developed areas may be paid for in the same
cost sharing manner as replacement sidewalks if volunteering owners so
request and if two (2) conditions are met:



   1.   There are no existing agreements to construct sidewalks; and



   2.   The owner or owners of the properties adjacent to the public
right of way upon which sidewalks would be located agree to participate in
the cost-sharing program.



3-4-4-7:  CONSTRUCTION AND STANDARDS:



   Sidewalks constructed pursuant to this Section may be constructed by
the Village or by its contractor.  Any sidewalks constructed shall conform
to the standards contained in Section 3-4-1 of this Chapter.



   When a private property owner is having other concrete work performed,
and will at the same time have sidewalk sections replaced which the Director
of Public Works has previously determined are in need of repair or
replacement under Section 3-4-4-2 this Code, the Village will reimburse the
property owner an amount equal to 85% of the Village's project cost for its
share of the repair work if performed by the Village or its contractor. 
Such reimbursement will be paid only after Village inspection and approval of
the completed work.



3-4-4-8:  EXTENT OF PROGRAM:



   The amount of money available for construction of replacement and new
sidewalks each year pursuant to this Section shall be determined by the
Village budget.



3-4-4-9:  EMERGENCY SIDEWALK REPAIRS:



   Nothing herein shall relieve the Director of Public Works of his duty
to see to the immediate reconstruction, replacement or repair of sidewalk
areas deemed hazardous or unsafe for public use, nor shall election to
participate in the sidewalk reconstruction, replacement and repair program by
any property owner or owners prevent or otherwise limit the corporate
authorities of the Village from a determination to construct, replace or
repair any sidewalk or section thereof by means within their corporate
powers.  (Ord. 2853, 3-4-96)

addresses within the Village for telecommunications originating or received
in the Village.



   (B)   Upon the effective date of the infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized in this Chapter, the Village infrastructure maintenance fee
authorized hereunder shall be the only fee or compensation for the use of all
public rights-of-way within the Village by telecommunications retailers. 
Imposition of  the infrastructure maintenance fee provided under this
Chapter does not, however,  serve as a limitation on the levying of any
taxes or imposition of any fees otherwise authorized by law.

or to become due, under this Chapter, from the telecommunications retailer
who made the erroneous payment; provided, however, the Village Manager may
request, and  telecommunications retailer shall provide, written

Village within the applicable statutory period of limitations, and (2) the
credit derives from an overpayment made by the same telecommunications
retailer during the applicable statutory period of  limitations.

Village plus five (5%) percent of  the total amount of the underpayment
determined in an audit,  plus any costs incurred by the Village in
conducting the audit, in an amount not to exceed five (5%) percent of the
total amount of the underpayment determined in an audit.  Said sum shall be
paid to the Village within twenty-one (21) days after the date of issuance of
an invoice for same.

such further or additional regulations concerning the administration and

   B.   Additional Village Review of Applications of Telecommunications
Retailers.



      1.   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act, 220
ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it
intends to commence work governed by this Chapter for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services. Such notice shall consist of plans,
specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the purpose
and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the telecommunications
retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior to the commencement
of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty (30) days prior to
the commencement of work requiting excavation.  The Village Director of
Engineering shall specify the portion of the right-of-way upon which the
facility may be placed, used and constructed.



      2.   In the event that the Village Director of Engineering
fails to provide such specification of location to the telecommunications
retailer within either (i) ten (10) days after service of notice to the
Village by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work not involving
excavation for new construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days after service
of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work involving
excavation for new construction, the telecommunications retailer may commence
work without obtaining a permit under this Chapter.



      3.   Upon the provision of such specification by the Village,
where a permit is required for work pursuant to Section 3-8-4 of this Chapter
the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an application
for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and documentation
available regarding the facility to be constructed.  Such application shall
be subject to the requirements of Subsection (A) of this Section.



3-8-6.  EFFECT OF PERMIT:



   A.   Authority Granted: No Property Right or Other Interest
Created.  A permit from the Village  authorizes a permittee to undertake
only certain activities in accordance with this Chapter on Village
rights-of-way, and does not create a property right or grant authority to the
permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in
the public rights-of-way.



   B.   Compliance with All Laws Required:  The issuance of a permit
by the Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the Village and all applicable statutes, laws, ordinances,
rules, and regulations.



3-8-7.  REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within ninety (90)
days after the completion of the permitted work.  The revised drawings or
plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual
facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit.  If any
deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this
Chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with
Section 3-8-21 of this Chapter, If the Village denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the
right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and
submit revised drawings or plans therefor.



3-8-8:  INSURANCE:



   A.   Required Coverages and Limits:  Unless otherwise provided by
franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying a
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure
and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility
as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed
officers, officials, agents, and employees as additional insureds on the
policies listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 below:



      1.   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as "X," "C," and "U' coverages) and products-completed operations
coverage with limits not less than:



         i.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily injury
or death to each person;



         ii.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for property
damage resulting from any one accident; and



         iii.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all other
types of liability;

vehicles with a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for
personal injury and property damage for each accident;



      3.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and



      4.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less
than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.



   B.   Excess or Umbrella Policies:  The coverages required by this
Section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella
policies.  Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over
underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss
covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy,
the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.



   C.   Copies Required: The utility shall provide copies of any of the
policies required by this Section to the Village at the time of registration
as provided in Section 3-8-3 of this Chapter and within ten (10) days
following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.



   D.   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages:  The insurance
policies required by this Section shall contain the following endorsement:



   "It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village Manager of
such intent to cancel or not to renew."



   Within ten (1O) days after receipt by the Village of said notice, and
in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the utility
shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement insurance
policies meeting the requirements of this Section.



   E.   Self-Insurance:  A utility may self-insure all or a portion of
the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by Subsection (A) of
this Section.  A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of
such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of
additional insureds under Subsection (A), or the requirements of Subsections
( B), (C) and (D) of this Section.  A utility that elects to self-insure
shall provide to the Village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial
ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required
under Subsection (A) of this Section, such as evidence that the utility is a
"private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act.



   F.   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's Liability:
The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person for any of
the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance
required by this Section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or
self- insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder.



3-8-9:  INDEMNIFICATION:



   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from
or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Chapter by the
Village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives.



3-8-10.  SECURITY:



   A.   Purpose:  The permittee shall establish a Security Fund in a
form and in an amount as set forth in this Section.  The Security Fund shall
be continuously maintained in accordance with this Section at the permittee's
sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the
permit.  The Security Fund shall serve as security for:



      1.   The faithful performance by the permittee of all the
requirements of this Chapter;



      2.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village
occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules,
regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village issued
pursuant to this Chapter; and



      3.   The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages,
claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any
action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this Chapter
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration
work the permittee is required by this Chapter to perform that the Village
must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the
permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the
Village from the permittee pursuant to this Chapter or any other applicable
law.



   B.   Form:  The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the
Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a
form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a
form acceptable to the Village.  Any surety bond or letter of credit
provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:



      1.   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice
to the Village and the permittee;



      2.   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the
collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and



      3.   Provide a location convenient to the Village and within
the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



   C.   Amount:  The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Director of
Engineering, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the
Village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform
such restoration.  Where the construction of facilities proposed under the
permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with
each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a
related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not
be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous
phase or phases, the Village Director of Engineering may, in the exercise of
reasonable discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of
security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under
the permit.  The amount of the Security Fund for phased construction shall
be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the
provisions of this Subsection (C) for any single phase.



   D.   Withdrawals:  The Village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance
written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise
withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw an amount from the
Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village for
such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period.  Withdrawals may be
made if the permittee:



      1.   Fails to make any payment required to be made by the
permittee hereunder;



      2.   Fails to pay any liens relating to the Facilities that
are due and unpaid;



      3.   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims,
costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by
reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or



      4.   Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that
the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount from
the Security Fund.



      5.   Fails to comply with any other obligation of permittee
created by issuance of the permit which the Village determines can be
remedied by an expenditure of an amount from the Security Fund.



   E.   Replenishment:  Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of
written notice from the Village that an amount has been withdrawn from the
Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the amount
specified in Subsection (C) of this Section.



   F.   Interest:  The permittee may request that any and all interest
accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the permittee by
the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the Village,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund below the
minimum balance required in Subsection (C) of this Section.



   G.   Closing and Return of Security Fund:  Upon completion of the
work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this Chapter or other applicable law.  In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a

discretion of the Village, be required to be discontinued when such
operations would create hazards to traffic or the public health, safety, and
welfare.  Such operations may also be required to be discontinued or
restricted when conditions are such that construction would result in
extensive damage to the right-of-way or other property.



      2.   These restrictions may be waived by the Director of
Engineering when emergency work is required to restore vital utility services.



      3.   Unless otherwise permitted by the Village, the hours of
construction are those set forth in Chapter 4 of Title 6 of this Code.



   E.   Location of Existing Facilities:  Any utility proposing to
construct facilities in the Village shall contact J.U.L.I.E. and ascertain
the presence and location of existing aboveground and underground facilities
within the rights-of-way to be occupied by its proposed facilities.  The
Village will make its permit records available to a utility for the purpose
of identifying possible facilities.  When notified of an excavation or when
requested by the Village or by J.U.L.I.E., a utility shall locate and
physically mark its underground facilities within 48 hours, excluding
weekends and holidays, in accordance with the Illinois Underground Facilities
Damage Prevention Act (220 ILCS 50/1 et seq.)



3-8-17:  VEGETATION CONTROL:



   A.   Tree Trimming Permit Required:  Tree trimming shall not be
considered a normal maintenance operation, but shall require the application
for, and the issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required
under this Chapter.



      1.   Application for Tree Trimming Permit.  Applications for
tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work will be
accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are experienced in
accepted tree pruning practices.  Tree trimming permits shall designate an
expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will be
expeditiously accomplished.



      2.   Damage to Trees.  Poor pruning practices resulting in
damaged or misshapen trees will not be tolerated and shall be grounds for
cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages.  The
Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged and for trees
removed without authorization.  The formula developed by the International
Society of Arboriculture will be used as a basis for determining the
compensation for damaged trees or unauthorized removal of trees.  The
Village may require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or
radical pruning would leave them in an unacceptable condition.



   B.   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance:  The Village
may require that special measures be taken to preserve specimen trees or
trees of special significance.  The required measures may consist of higher
poles, side arm extensions, covered wire or other means.



   C.   Chemical Use:  Spraying of any type of brush-killing chemicals
will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Director of Engineering that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.



3-8-18:  REMOVAL,  RELOCATION, OR MODIFICATIONS OF UTILITY FACILITIES:



   A.   Notice:  Within ninety (90) days following written notice from
the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense, temporarily or permanently
remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities
within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined
that such removal, relocation change or alteration, is reasonably necessary
for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village
improvement in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the
rights-of-way.



   B.   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities:  Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the Village, any utility that owns, controls,
or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the
public rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of
such facilities or appurtenances from the public rights-of-way.  A facility
is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:



      1.   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license
or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;



      2.   If the facility was constructed or installed without the
prior grant of a license or franchise, if required;



      3.   If the facility was constructed or installed without
prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this Chapter; or



      4.   If the facility was constructed or installed at a
location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.



   C.   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities:  The Village
retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within
the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety
emergency.  If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to
notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and
shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.



   D.   Abandonment of Facilities:  Upon abandonment of a facility
within any public right-of-way of the Village, the utility shall notify the
Village within ninety (90) days, Following receipt of such notice the Village
may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the
Village Director of Engineering determines that such removal will be in the
best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.  In the event that
the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove
it, by giving notice of abandonment to the Village the abandoning utility
shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion
of the facility by another utility or person.



3-8-19:  CLEANUP AND RESTORATION:



   Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the
utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain in
a timely manner and to the satisfaction of the Village.  This includes
restoration of entrances and side roads.  Restoration of roadway surfaces
shall be made using materials and methods approved by the Village Director of
Engineering.  Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of
backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to
restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that
which existed prior to the commencement of the project.



3-8-20:  MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE:



   A.   General.  Facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under,
across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the utility in
a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.



   B.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures:  Emergencies may justify
non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:



      1.   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion
of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all
necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on the
right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers.  If
a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency
is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in
repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided.  Parking on
the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means
of access to the facility is available.



      2.   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible
but at least within 24 hours, notify the Village Director of Engineering or
his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to
what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what
will be required to make the necessary repairs.  If the nature of the
emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the
Village police shall be notified immediately.



      3.   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand
to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.



   A.   Emergency Repairs:  The utility must file with the Village a
written description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way within 48
hours after an emergency repair.



3-8-21:  VARIANCES:



   A.   Request for Variance:  A utility requesting a variance from
one or more of the provisions of this Chapter  must do so in writing to the
Village Director of Engineering as a part of the permit application.  The
request shall identify each provision of this Chapter from which a variance
is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.



   B.   Authority to Grant Variances:  The Village Director of
Director of Engineering shall decide whether a variance is authorized for
each provision of this Chapter identified in the variance request on an
individual basis.



   C.   Conditions for Granting of Variance:  The Village Director of
Engineering may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the
variance has demonstrated that:



      1.   One or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



      2.   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.



   D.   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance:  As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the Village Director of Engineering may
require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and
conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this Chapter but
which carry out the purposes of this Chapter.



3-8-22:  PENALTIES:



   Any person, firm, corporation or entity who violates, disobeys, omits,
neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter
shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this
Code.  There may be times when the Village will incur delay or other costs,
including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform
its duties under its permit and this Chapter.  Unless the utility shows that
another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is
appropriate, the utility shall bear the Village's costs of damages and its
costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the
facility that is the subject of the permit.  No other administrative agency
or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of
the Village.  Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility which does not pay the
costs apportioned to it. 



(Amd. Ord. 5103, 6-6-16)



3-8-23:  ENFORCEMENT:



   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the Village  may have for enforcement of this
Chapter.



3-8-24:  SEVERABILITY:



   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
Chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct,
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions hereof.

3-10-1:  PURPOSE:



Consistent with the requirements of the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment
Act (Public Act 100-585), and in anticipation of a continued increased demand
for placement of small wireless facilities of the type regulated by the Act
both within the public rights-of-way and in other locations within the
jurisdiction of the Village, the Village Board has found it to be in the best
interests of the public health, safety and general welfare of the Village to
adopt the code amendments set forth in this Chapter in order to establish
generally applicable standards for the design, permitting, location,
construction, deployment, regulation, operation, maintenance, repair and
removal of such small wireless facilities both within the public
rights-of-way and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the Village
so as to, among other things:



   A.   Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the
Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located both within
public rights-of-way and in other locations within the jurisdiction of the
Village;



   B.   Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which such small
wireless facilities are installed;



   C.   Minimize any adverse visual impact of small wireless facilities
and prevent visual blight in the neighborhoods in which such facilities are
installed;



   D.   Ensure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private
properties adjacent to small wireless facilities;



   E.   Provide appropriate aesthetic protections to any designated
historic landmarks or districts within the Village; and



   F.   Ensure that the placement of small wireless facilities does not
negatively impact public safety and the Village's public safety technology.

(1) or more small wireless facility collocations, or includes requests for
small wireless facilities that do not qualify for consolidated treatment, or
that are otherwise denied, the Village may remove such collocation requests
from the application and treat them as separate requests.  Separate permits
may be issued for each collocation approved in a consolidated application.



   K.   Alternate Locations:  If an applicant is seeking to install a
new utility pole as part of its application, the Village may propose that the
small wireless facility be located on an existing utility pole or existing
wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed
collocation.  The applicant shall accept the proposed alternate location so
long as it has the right to use the location on reasonable terms and
conditions, unless the alternate location imposes technical limits or
additional material costs as determined by the applicant.  If the applicant
refuses an alternate location based on the foregoing, the applicant shall
provide legally competent evidence in the form of a written certification,
under oath, describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost
reasons that prevent the alternate location from being utilized.

Village permitting requirements where traffic patterns are affected or lane
closures are required.  (Ord. 5314, 7-16-18)



3-10-6:  CONSTRUCTION:



   Collocations for which permits are approved shall be completed within
one hundred eighty (180) days of issuance of the permit, unless the Village
agrees to extend the period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a
Village utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul
availability at the site, provided the applicant has made a timely request
within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power
or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does
not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. 
Permits that are not completed within applicable timelines shall be void
absent an extension granted in writing by the Village.  (Ord. 5314, 7-16-18)

3-10-9:  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:



   A.   Public Safety Technology:  A wireless provider's operation of
a small wireless facility may not interfere with the frequencies used by a
public safety agency for public safety communications.  A wireless provider
must install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will
not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's
communications equipment.  Unacceptable interference is determined by and
measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations
addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other
spectrum licenses by a public safety agency.  If a small wireless facility
causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written
notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless
provider, at its own expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to
correct and eliminate the interference, including, but not limited to,
powering down the small wireless facility and later powering up the small
wireless facility for intermittent testing, if necessary.  The Village may
terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference
if the wireless provider is not making a good faith effort to remedy the
problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures
for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC,
including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47
CFR 90.675.  The burden to establish the good faith effort shall be on the
wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the Village all information
necessary to demonstrate its efforts to resolve the interference consistent
with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited above.  Failure to
remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance
and the small wireless facility may be abated through the procedures for
abatement of such nuisances set forth in this Code.



   B.   A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small
wireless facility that:



      1.   Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public
safety on a right-of-way;



      2.   Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;

Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way) of the Orland Park Municipal Code,
and Section 7-102 (Construction of Utility Facilities in the Public
Rights-of-Way) of the Land Development Code.



   E.   Undergrounding:



      1.   The wireless provider shall comply with Village code
provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements, if any,
that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility
poles or equipment in the right-of-way.



       2.   A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the
development services director or his or her designee to allow small wireless
facilities to be located above ground in an area where Village ordinances or
regulations prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if the wireless
provider can establish that all of the following standards have been met:



         a.   Underground equipment is not technically feasible
and there is no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically
favorable to adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of
the right-of-way; and



         b.   An above ground small wireless facility at the
proposed location is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage
in a specified area; and



         c.   An above ground small wireless facility at the
proposed location will not disrupt traffic or pedestrian circulation or
constitute a safety hazard; and



         d.   An above ground small wireless facility at the
proposed location will not interfere with public safety uses or frequencies;
and



         e.   Space exists within the public right-of-way to
accommodate the above ground small wireless facility at the proposed
location; and

area; and



         i.   All other reasonable alternatives for placement of
the wireless facility have been exhausted.



         j.   Screening for Ground Mounted Facilities.  Where a
ground-mounted facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around
the perimeter in accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional
landscape engineer.  Plant materials shall include a mixture of deciduous
and coniferous planting materials.  The owner or wireless provider shall be
responsible for maintenance of all landscaping as provided in the approved
landscape plan.



      3.   [Reserved.]



      4.   Future Undergrounding:  The Village may, from time to
time, make a decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular
type generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant
portion of the Village.  In the event that such a utility pole has a
collocated small wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision,
the Village shall either:



         a.   Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install
and maintain a reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the
collocation of the small wireless facility; or



         b.   Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless
provider at a reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its
own utility pole so it can maintain service from that location.



   F.   Collocation Limits:  Wireless providers shall not collocate
small wireless facilities on Village utility poles that are part of an
electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker
safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole.



      However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless
facility may be located in the communications space on the Village utility
pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the
wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top

      8.   Small wireless facilities, other than top-mounted
antennas, shall be mounted on the side of the utility pole or wireless
support structure opposite the direction of vehicular traffic along the same
side of the right-of-way.



      9.   Alternative measures for concealment may be proposed by
the wireless provider and approved by the public works director, if the
public works director determines that the optional measures will be at least
as effective in concealing the small wireless facilities as the measures
required above.



   C.   Historic Districts and Landmarks:  For areas designated as
historic districts, including but not limited to the Old Orland Historic
District, or on buildings or structures designated as historic landmarks or
contributing structures within a designated historic district pursuant to
Section 6-209 (Old Orland Historic District) of the Land Development Code, in
addition to the stealth, concealment and design requirements referenced
above, the following additional restrictions/conditions apply to the
installation of small wireless facilities:



      1.   Small wireless facilities shall not be mounted upon:

any other designated historic district;



         c.   Locations outside of the right-of-way in the Old
Orland Historic District; or



         d.   On any designated historic landmark within the
Village or on contributing structures within the Old Orland Historic District
or any other designated historic district.



      2.   Small wireless facilities located within the right-of-way
in the Old Orland Historic District or within the right-of-way in any other
designated historic district shall utilize stealth technology and be designed
in such a manner so as to preserve the character of district, ensure
consistency with the surrounding elements, blend architecturally with any
buildings or structures designated as historic landmarks or located within a
designated historic district, and shall be designed to blend with the
surrounding historical landmarks and/or district in design and color.



   D.   Historic District Limitations:



      1.   Any stealth, concealment and design standards, including
restrictions on a specific category of utility poles, may not have the effect
of prohibiting any provider's technology.  Such stealth, concealment and
design measures shall not be considered a part of the small wireless facility
for purposes of the size restrictions of a small wireless facility.



      2.   This subsection shall not be construed to limit the
Village's enforcement of historic preservation in conformance with the
requirements adopted pursuant to the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources
Preservation Act or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 54 U.S.C.

4-2-1a:  Definition:



   For purposes of this Chapter, and elsewhere in this Code where
reasonable, meter shall mean any registering device, to measure or
otherwise indicate water consumption or usage, which device is approved by
the Village Board of Trustees for installation upon premises served by
Village water.  (Ord. 3582, 12-17-01)



4-2-2:  METER RESTRICTIONS:

   No person shall use, set, attach or fix any device, attachment, pipe or
hose, or use any means whatsoever calculated to circumvent the flow of water
from service connections from a meter which has been installed upon any
premises for the purpose of registering the flow of water used in and upon
the premises to the pipe leading from such meter into the distributor upon
said premises.

according to the read on the inside meter.  Whenever any meter, by reason of
its being out of repair, or for any cause, fails to properly register the
water passing through the same, the consumer shall be charged at the rate
shown for a corresponding time of a previous year under like conditions.  If
no record of a previous year exists, then it shall be the duty of the
Director of Finance to estimate or determine so far as he can, the amount of

(also known as waste water reclamation) for treatment and disposal of
sewerage wastes.



         2.   The computed sewer treatment charges are in
addition to the charges set forth in subsection B. above.



         3.   The amount of the wastewater treatment charges
provided under this section shall be presented separately on the quarterly

within Frankfort Township, west of Wolf Road, Will County, and within New
Lenox Township, Will County, and also within the wastewater service area
under an agreement between the Village and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago (hereinafter MWRD), an amount shall be
charged for wastewater treatment services and computed as follows:



               (i)   The most currently available equalized
assessed valuation for the property at the time the quarterly bill is being
prepared shall be multiplied by the most recent available real estate tax
rate of the MWRD for property within its district boundaries (primarily in
Cook County) and the result thereof shall be multiplied by 140% to obtain the
annual wastewater treatment charge for such property.



               (ii)   One quarter of this amount shall be
added to each subsequent quarterly utility bill rendered.



               (iii)   Each year, as a new equalized
assessed valuation becomes available for the subject property and/or a new
tax rate becomes available for the MWRD, the amount of such user charge shall
be recomputed utilizing such new equalized assessed valuation and/or tax rate
and shall apply to the subsequent quarterly utility bills rendered.



            (b)   This sewer treatment charge is applicable to
all properties which lie within the corporate limits of the Village in
Frankfort Township, west of Wolfe Road, Will County, and within New Lenox
Township, Will County, and also within the designated wastewater service area
under an agreement between the Village and the MWRD regardless of whether the
property is vacant land or otherwise developed.



            (c)   From time to time, a property owner may have
had cause to appeal the valuation of property for property tax purposes, or
have an error corrected that affects the property valuation, which may have
resulted in the recalculation of the related annual property tax bill. Should
a property valuation (equalized assessed valuation) for a given tax year be
reduced, the Village utility customer may be eligible for a reduction in the
related sewer treatment charge which is based on the equalized assessed
valuation.



               (i)   The recalculation of an annual sewer
treatment charge under this section due to a subsequent adjustment to
equalized assessed valuation will not occur automatically as the Village is
not notified of such changes as they occur. It is the property owners
responsibility to notify the Village of such changes in order to initiate the
recalculation of the annual sewer treatment charges.



               (ii)   The property owner must provide the
Village Finance Director, or such other person that may be designated by the
Finance Director, with valid and legible documentation of the revised or
adjusted equalized assessed valuation. Upon verification and validation of
the information provided, the calculation of the annual sewer treatment
charges based on that tax years equalized assessed valuation can be
recalculated and adjusted.



               (iii)   Any such adjustment to the sewer
treatment charge will be provided as a credit against the current and future
sewer treatment charges.  (Amd. Ord. 5049, 12- 7-15; Amd. Ord. 5071, 3-14-16)

4-3-4:  DELINQUENT PAYMENTS:



In the event the charges for service are not paid by the due date, such

   1.   A copy of each delinquency notice sent to the person who is
delinquent in paying the charges or rates, or other notice sufficient to
inform said owner(s) of record that the charges or rates have become
delinquent;



   2.   A statement that the unpaid charges or rates may create a lien
on the real estate; and



   3.   A sworn statement setting out:



      a.   A description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof;

the Notice of Delinquency as set forth above, the Village Finance Director or
his or her designee shall cause to be mailed or delivered to the customer a
written final notice informing the customer not only of the possibility of
termination/disconnection of service if the delinquent bill is not paid

disconnected on a holiday or weekend day unless the Village is prepared to
reconnect on the holiday or weekend day.



The service shall not be disconnected and shall be restored if disconnected
for the reason which is the subject of a dispute or complaint during the
pendency of procedures relating to said dispute or complaint.  The Finance
Director's designee shall hear all matters relating to disputes or complaints
relating to the operation and charges for the services of the Combined
Waterworks and Sewerage System of the Village.  The Village shall consider
the complainants allegations and shall explain the users account and
the contention of the Village in connection therewith.  The said Finance
Director's designee shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Village in
resolving the complaint.  Said designee shall be available during all
business hours for the hearing of said complaints.  In the event said
designee shall be unavailable during said business hours, the Finance

   2.   Pays all future periodic bills by the due date; and



   3.   Enters into bona fide discussions with the Village to settle
the dispute with dispatch.



Disconnection of service to residential customers is prohibited for up to
sixty (60) days when discontinuance of service will aggravate an existing
serious illness of any person who is a permanent resident of the premises
where service is rendered if the user complies with the following
requirements regarding such illness.



The illness must be certified to the Village by a registered physician or
local Board of Health.  The certification shall be in writing and shall
include the name of the ill person, a statement that he/she is a resident of
the premises in question, the name, business address and telephone number of
the certifying party, the nature of the illness and the period of time during
which termination will aggravate the illness.



Initial certification by the certifying party may be by telephone if written
certification is forwarded to the Village within five (5) days.



Initial certification shall prohibit disconnection of service for thirty (30)
days.  Certification may be renewed by the user for an additional thirty
(30) days by providing another certificate to the Village.  Failure to so
renew the certificate shall entitle the Village to initiate disconnection
procedures.



The user must enter into an agreement for the retirement of the unpaid
balance of the account within the first thirty (30) days and keep the current
account paid during the period that the unpaid balance is to be retired.



In the event service is terminated within fourteen (14) days prior to
certification of illness by or for a qualifying resident service shall be
restored to that residence if a proper certification is thereafter made in
accordance with the foregoing provisions.



Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent disconnection of
service for reasons of safety, health, or cooperation with other civil
authorities.



Residential users who are indebted to the Village for past due service shall
have the opportunity to make arrangements with the Village to retire the debt
by periodic payments referred to hereinafter as deferred payment agreement
unless said user has failed to make payment under such a plan during the past
twelve (12) months.  Nonresidential users who are indebted to a utility for
past due service may have the opportunity, at the discretion of the Village,
to make arrangements with the Village to retire the debt by periodic payments
referred to hereinafter as a deferred payment agreement.



The terms and conditions of a deferred payment agreement may be determined by
the Village after consideration of the following:



   1.   Size of the past due account; and



   2.   Users ability to pay; and



   3.   Users payment history; and



   4.   Reasons for the outstanding indebtedness; and



   5.   Any other relevant factors relating to the circumstances of the
users service.



Late payment  charges  may  be  assessed  against  the  amount  owing
which is the subject of a deferred payment agreement.



Deferred payment agreement shall be in writing, with a copy provided to the
user, and shall conform to the following requirements:



   1.   The user shall be required to pay all future bills for utility
service by the due date; and



   2.   User shall retire his/her debt according to the terms of the
deferred payment agreement.



If a user shall default upon any payment due under the deferred payment
agreement, the Village shall have the right to discontinue service as herein
provided.  (Ord. 1129, 11-16-81)



In the event service shall be disconnected, a fee of Seventy-Five Dollars
($75.00) shall be charged and paid for the first shutoff for any account
before said service shall be reconnected. The second disconnection for the
same account will require a payment of a One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) fee and
a One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) deposit.  The third disconnection and any
succeeding disconnections for the same account will require payment of a One
Hundred and Fifty Dollar ($150.00) fee.  The disconnection/reconnection fee
is due upon notice of disconnection whether or not the actual disconnection
has been done. The One Hundred Dollar ($100.00) deposit shall be returned
after one year of on-time payment is recorded for the account. (Ord. 2877,
5-6-96)



Failure to pay after service has been disconnected shall constitute a lien
upon the real estate for which such service is supplied. The Village Finance
Director or his or her designee is hereby authorized to file sworn detailed
statements showing such delinquencies in the office of the Recorder of Deeds
or the office of the Registrar of Title, Cook or Will County, Illinois. The
notice of lien shall be sent to the taxpayer shown on the tax bill of the
property involved as the owner of record if the user is not the owner of the
parcel involved. The Village may also, at its election, institute a civil
action to recover such delinquent charges. The notice of lien shall be in
substantially the form designated on file in the office of the Village Clerk.

4-4-1:  CONNECTIONS:



4-4-1-1:  CONNECTION PERMIT; APPLICATION; PLANS:



   No connection shall be made to the combined waterworks and sewerage
system of the Village within the corporate limits without a permit having
been issued by the Director of the Building Department.  For areas outside
the corporate limits, an agreement or contract is required before connection
is permitted.  A written application for connection to the water facilities
of the combined waterworks and sewerage system of the Village shall be made
to the Director of the Building Department.  The application shall state the
name of the applicant, the permit desired, the location of the real estate
including the dimensions thereof and the location of the connection.  Such
application shall be accompanied by engineering plans indicating the
construction to be used.



   All water connections to the Village water facilities shall be made or
caused to be made by authorized personnel in the employment of the Village or
by a plumber approved by the Village.  Each such connection service shall
consist of the supply and insertion of a corporation cock only on the open
main at the service location designated by approved engineering plans.  All
water connections to the Village water system not made by authorized
personnel in the employment of the Village, shall be made by a licensed
plumber acting under the approval and direction of the Director of the
Building Department.  No plumber shall make or cause any such water
connection to be made unless he shall have first met all the requirements for
the lawful conduct of such trade in the Village.



   Service pipes shall serve one building only.  All service pipes shall
be laid at least five feet (5') below the final surface grade level.  The
water service shall be constructed of copper pipe for sizes two inches (2")
and smaller and of ductile iron for sizes in excess of two inches (2").



   Each residential water service customer shall have a separate metered
water service as an end unit user.  The service shall be tapped into the
water main and extend into the unit without passing through another user
unit.  Common area water service outlets such as yard areas shall be metered
independently.



   An exception may be allowed only for certain multi-floor buildings by
written approval from the Village Director of the Building Department based
upon good plumbing standards and practices.  If an exception is made, the
building will be supplied by one adequately sized service into a meter
room.  Inside the meter room, the service shall be manifolded to accept a
meter for each unit served.  The manifold shall be constructed similarly to
single meter settings with valving and padlock locking devices as approved by
the Village Plumbing Inspector.



   The meter room shall be accessible from a public area and constructed
solely for water meter housing.  A separate conduit shall be installed by
the electrical contractor from each meter to a common point area on the
building exterior.  Location and placement of the wiring shall be determined
by the Village Plumbing Inspector.



   Each commercial or industrial water service customer shall have the
option of determining a single service connection or multiple service
connection for each building.  Each service connection shall be tapped into
the water main and extended into the building it serves.  Each building
service connection shall have its own meter setting.  The service size,
construction, location and connection charge shall be approved by the
Director of the Building Department.  When the domestic water usage of a
building is determined by the Director of the Building Department to exceed
the maximum flow of a one-inch water service and one-inch water meter, each
service connection shall be tapped into the water main and extended into the
building it serves with a minimum of a two-inch water service and water
meter.  (Ord.  3341, 3-6-00)



   The Director of the Building Department shall calculate the appropriate
water service size for proper water flow to each building.  Where a
commercial or industrial customer prefers to use individual water services
and the total connection fee amount for the building exceeds the cost of a
larger combined single service connection for that building, as calculated by
the Director of the Building Department, the lesser of the two fees shall
apply.



   A single service meter serving two or more units of a building shall be
accessible from a public area readily open to the Village of Orland Park
personnel.



   The public water supply shall be protected by backflow prevention
device as required by this Code for all connections.



   A connection shall be considered to be made when, pursuant to a permit,
the meter is installed and water is available to the end unit user.  All
connection charges shall be paid to the Director of the Building Department.



(Ord. 2032, 8-20-90)

   If a larger meter set is added after the initial permit is issued, the
difference between the smaller and larger meter shall be due upon
installation of the larger meter.



   For a tap size over six inches (6"), the connection charge shall be
negotiated and agreed upon between the applicant and the Board of Trustees
but it shall not be less than the minimum charge for a six inch (6") tap and
one inch (1") meter set.  The Village Engineer shall make a recommendation
to the Board of Trustees of the amount of the fee based on an estimate of
water usage.  The applicant shall furnish the necessary information for the
Village Engineer to make said estimate.



   Payment:  The time of payment of the connection charges herein
provided may be modified by the Village and an applicant or future applicant
by the terms of an annexation agreement executed pursuant to the provisions
of Division 15.1 of Article 11 of Act 5 of the Illinois Municipal Code, or by

other type construction shall hereafter make a connection between any
sanitary sewer main of the sanitary sewerage collection system of the Village
of Orland Park and any roof drain, footing drain, or any other storm water
drain or make any such connection to any interceptor of the Metropolitan
Water Reclamation District.  Any such person, firm, partnership or
corporation violating any provision of this Chapter shall, in addition to all
other penalties provided for in this Chapter, be subject to the revocation of
any business license or building permit issued to it to conduct business or

4-7-4:  MAINTENANCE OF SERVICES:



   The proper maintenance and operation of a building service sewer, house
connection or sanitary sewer line up to the point of connection to the
Village sanitary sewer system shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
premises served by the sanitary sewer system.  Maintenance means keeping the
sanitary sewer connection, sewer lines or other sewer facilities or
structures in satisfactory working condition and good state of repair
(including, but not limited to, preventing any obstruction therein,
preventing extraneous materials or flows from entering the facilities,
protecting the facilities from any damage and keeping the facilities free

produce.



   Downspouts or roof drains shall not discharge into any sanitary sewer
system.  Footing drains shall be connected to sump pumps and discharge shall
be made into storm sewers, drainage ditches or drainage system.  Sump pumps
installed to receive and discharge ground waters or other storm water shall
be connected to the storm sewer or discharge into a drainage ditch or
drainage system.  Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge floor drain
flow, laundry tubs or other sanitary sewage shall be connected to the
sanitary sewers.  A sump pump shall be used for one function only, either
the discharge of storm waters, or the discharge of sanitary sewage.



4-7-5:  RESPONSIBILITIES OF PLUMBERS, CONTRACTORS:



   No person engaged in the sewer and/or plumbing business and licensed by
the Village, or in any other business relating to the construction of
buildings, roads or any other type construction shall hereafter make a
connection between any sanitary sewer main of the sanitary sewerage
collection system of the Village and any roof drain, footing drain, or any
other storm water drain or make any such connection to any interceptor of the
Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago.  Any such person
violating any provision of this Section shall, in addition to all other
penalties provided for herein, be subject to the revocation of any business
license or building permit issued to it to conduct business or engage in
construction in the Village.



4-7-6:  ENFORCEMENT:



   It shall be the duty of the Village Plumbing Inspector (hereinafter
referred to as the Enforcement Officer) to enforce the provisions of this
Chapter.  The Enforcement Officer shall issue all necessary notices to
inspect, test and abate all illegal connections into the sanitary sewer of
the Village.



   Whenever the Enforcement Officer determines that there is a violation
of this Chapter or has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation does
exist, he shall give notice to the owner or to the person responsible
therefor in the following manner: such notice shall be in writing, shall
describe the real estate and contain a statement for the reason or reasons
why it is being issued and, where applicable, include a correction order
allowing for a period not to exceed forty five (45) days for the repairs and
improvements required to bring the dwelling unit or structure into compliance
with the provisions of this Chapter.  Such notice shall be deemed to be
properly served upon such owner if a copy is delivered to him personally, or
by leaving the notice at the usual place of abode, in the presence of someone
in the family of suitable age and discretion who shall be informed of the
contents thereof, or by certified or registered mail, addressed to the owner
at the last known address with return receipt requested.



   Within forty five (45) days after notice to the property owner by the
Village of the presence of illegal sanitary sewer connections, the property
owner shall, at his or its expense, disconnect all illegal sanitary sewer
connections and shall take all necessary action to discontinue all discharges
of direct or indirect extraneous flows into the sanitary sewer system.



   In the event the Village shall advance for the benefit of the property
owner any sums to be used by the property owner in the abatement of any
illegal sanitary sewer connection then, and in that event, all sums so
advanced shall become a lien upon the property owner's real estate until
repaid as directed by the Board of Trustees of the Village.  The Village may
file a notice of lien in the office of the Recorder of Deeds and the notice
filed shall set forth (1) a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification thereof, and (2) the amount of money advanced on the part of
the property owner and the balance then unpaid.  Upon payment of the sums
due the Village, the lien shall be released by the Village.  The lien may be
enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in case of mortgages or mechanics'
liens.



4-7-7:  TESTS AND INSPECTIONS:



   In addition to visual inspections on the outside or the inside of the
premises as indicated in Section 4-7-6 above, the Village may make other
tests and inspections of the sanitary sewer systems as it deems necessary in
order to locate such illegal connections and sources of extraneous flows as
may exist.  The provisions of this Chapter are in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other legal remedy available to the Village, including the right
to institute legal proceedings to discover and order the disconnection of any
illegal connections that are found to exist.



4-7-8:  PENALTY



   Any person, firm, partnership or corporation failing to allow the
Village an inspection as provided in 4-7-6 of this Chapter, shall be in
violation of this Chapter and shall be according to the fine schedule located
in Appendix B for each offense of which such person shall be convicted. 
Each day such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.



   Any person, firm, partnership or corporation found to be in violation
of the prohibitions of this Chapter and who has not disconnected said illegal
connection by the October 1, 1997, date provided in 4-7-8 shall be fined
$1,000.00.  Said fine shall be in addition to any other fines imposed by the
terms of this Chapter.  Each day such violation shall continue shall
constitute a separate offense.



   Any person, firm, partnership or corporation violating any other
provision of this Chapter shall be fined according to the fine schedule
located in Appendix B for each offense of which such person shall be
convicted. Each day such violation shall continue shall constitute a separate
offense.

the maintenance or upkeep thereon nor liable for any damages resulting from
construction or maintenance or lack thereof.  (Ord. 119, 1-26-53)



4-8-3:  LAWN SPRINKLING AND OTHER OUTDOOR WATER USE:



   1.   At all times of the year lawn sprinkling, whether performed by
manual hose and sprinkler placement or by automatic systems, is permitted
only between the hours of either 7 - 11 a.m. or  7 - 11 p.m.  Other outdoor
water use is unregulated from September 16 of any year to May 14 of the
following year.



   2.   Between May 15 and September 15, inclusive, of every year, all

Public Works Department.



   5.   The Village reserves the right to further limit or suspend all
outdoor water use when the President and Board of Trustees determine that
public exigencies or emergencies require such action.  If public exigencies
or emergencies so require, due to the possibility that the water supply will
not meet demand, the President may unilaterally declare and take such action
prior to the next regularly scheduled or specially scheduled meeting of the
President and Board of Trustees.  At the next meeting of the President and
Board of Trustees after the Village President's action, the emergency

shall comply with the Orland Park Plumbing Code by being equipped with an
approved rain detection device at installation.  In order to assist existing
lawn sprinkling systems without such devices to be retrofitted with rain
detection devices, the Village has established a cost sharing program that
will reimburse 50% of the cost of installation of an approved rain detection
device, up to a maximum reimbursement of $70.00.  The Building Department
administers this program and will issue a no charge permit for the
installation of an approved rain detection device on an existing lawn
sprinkling system that does not have such a device.  (Ord. 3704, 11-4-02) In

paragraph, provided that said person, corporation or organization has first
been given notice of the special emergency order by telephone, facsimile,
U.S. mail or personal service.  After notice is given, each day of violation
and each violating location shall be considered a separate offense under this
Section.  (Ord. 3297, 10-4-99)



   9.   Upon proper application to the Village and in accordance with
rules and regulations established from time to time by the Village Director
of Public Works, an outdoor watering system utilizing a private well or,
privately owned retention pond may be installed by the person, firm or
corporation owning the well or the single family/multi family homeowner's
association served by the pond so long as such outdoor watering system has
been fully inspected and approved by the Village Building Department/Code
Enforcement Officer(s), is at all times in compliance with all applicable
Village Codes and Ordinances, is installed so as to prevent any cross
connection with the Village potable water system, includes automatic shutoff
during rainfall, and the Village is fully indemnified and held harmless from
any liability resulting from the installation and operation of such outdoor
watering system.  Publicly (Village) owned retention ponds shall not be used
for outdoor water irrigation.  The Village Director of Public Works shall
provide an appropriate application form for the installation and operation of
an outdoor watering system utilizing a private well or privately owned
retention pond.  An approved application shall result in a permit for such
installation.  The permit may be conditioned as the Director of Public Works
finds necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of this sub section.

by the pond so long as the aerator system has been fully inspected and
approved by the Village Building Department/Code Enforcement Officer(s), is
at all times in compliance with all applicable Village Codes and Ordinances,
and the Village is fully indemnified and held harmless by the homeowner's
association installing and operating the aerator from any liability resulting
from the installation and operation of such aerator.  The Village Director
of Public Works shall provide an appropriate application form for the
installation and operation of the retention pond aerator.  (Ord. 4048,
7-18-05)

hydrants from which water is to be taken or permitted to flow, the time at
which such use of water will commence and cease, the estimated period that
said hydrant will be open and water flowing therefrom, the size of pipe or
hose, if any, which will be connected to said fire hydrant or hydrants, the
capacity of any tank into which water shall be poured and an estimate of the
number of gallons of water that will be permitted to flow from said fire
hydrant during the permit period.



   The Village Manager shall fix the fee for the issuance of such permit,
which fee shall be based on the estimated amount of water that will be
permitted to flow from said fire hydrant or hydrants based on the rates
provided for water service; provided however, that in the event said water is
to be permitted to flow from said fire hydrant or hydrants to flush or test a
water main or any extension thereof, the fee may be waived by the Village
Manager.  Village approved metering and/or backflow protection equipment
must be installed by the permittee.



   Said permit shall provide when said fire hydrant or hydrants may be
opened and water taken or permitted to flow therefrom; provided however, that
no such permit shall provide for the use of flowing water from any fire
hydrant for the purpose of flushing a water main or any extension thereof
without the approval and presence of the Village Utility Inspector.



   No person to whom such permit is issued shall consent to the use of
water permitted to flow from said fire hydrant by any other person, and any
person to whom such permit is issued shall at all times use precaution to
prevent any waste of water or damage, and upon completion of the purpose for
which said water use was authorized or upon the expiration of the time
specified in said permit, he shall be required to completely close said fire
hydrant.  (Ord. 283, 12-9-63)



4-8-5:  WATER WELLS, USE RESTRICTED:



   Except as provided in this Section, no person shall drill, or make use

Village containing an area of less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet
and no permit for such water well shall issue hereafter.



   Water wells may be drilled and used on any tract of land exceeding
fifteen thousand (15,000) feet within the Village exclusively for the limited
purposes of outdoor agricultural and horticultural irrigation, subject to the
following conditions:



   1.   The Municipal water system on the premises shall be protected
by proper backflow and water expansion devices as specified by applicable
State, County and Federal law.



   2.   Water conservation devices shall be installed within the
private plumbing system conveying Municipal potable water in conformity with
requirements of the Illinois Department of National Resources (IDNR).



   3.   No piping connections whatsoever may exist between the
Municipal water supply and the well water supply.



   4.   All persons operating a private well or applying for permits to
install and operate a private well shall comply fully with the rules and
regulations of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) regarding
private wells; as well as with all other State, local and Federal laws
governing same.



   5.   All persons operating an existing private well on a lot or
tract of real estate exceeding fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in area

4-9-2:   Approval of Final Plat



4-9-3:   Payment Schedule



4-9-4:   Annexation Requirements



4-9-1:  CONNECTION FEE:



   Whenever any lands included in zoning districts pursuant to the Land
Development Code of the Village and being the subject matter of a plat of
subdivision or plat of resubdivision or a plat of a planned unit development
or plat of commercial or industrial development are to be served by the
Village combined waterworks and sewerage system, a connection fee thereto
shall be paid to the Village by a developer, determined as follows:



   Attached Single-Family Residential Construction and Townhomes:  A
connection fee of $1,350.00 per dwelling unit contained in an attached
single-family residence and townhome construction shall be payable to the
Village in the manner prescribed herein.  The number of dwelling units shall
be determined by those delineated on the plat.



   Detached Single-Family Residential Construction:  A connection fee of
eighteen hundred dollars ($1,800.00) per single-family residence to be
constructed shall be payable to the Village in that manner prescribed herein.



   Multi-Family Residential Construction:  A connection fee of nine
hundred fifty dollars ($900.00) per dwelling unit contained in a multi-family
development shall be payable to the Village in the manner prescribed
herein.  The number of dwelling units shall be determined by those units
delineated on the plat.



   In determining the number of acres for purposes of calculating  the
total number of units that acreage used for a water retention or detention
basin to serve the multi-family units, shall not be included.



   Commercial and Industrial Development:  For commercial and industrial
developers, a connection fee shall be charged to the development in accord
with the following formula:



   One dollar fifty cents ($1.50) per the average number of gallons of
water used daily during the first year of full occupancy of the development.
Such connection fee shall be payable to the Village.



   In calculating that portion of the connection fee based on average
daily gallons of usage of water, the following procedure shall be used: An
estimated connection fee shall be calculated based on estimated average daily
gallon usage of water.  The estimate of average daily gallon usage shall be
made by the Water and Sewerage Department in accord with those figures set
forth in the following table.  Seventy five percent (75%) of the estimated
connection fee shall be the amount to be paid.  After the commercial or
industrial development has been fully occupied for a year, the actual average
daily gallon usage of water will be determined and the actual fee
determined.  If the actual fee exceeds seventy five percent (75%) of the
estimated connection fee, said difference shall be paid to the Village.  If
the seventy five percent (75%) of the estimated connection fees  exceed the
actual fee, the difference shall be refunded to, the developer.

   No plat of development of lands included in zoning districts pursuant
to the zoning ordinance of the Village shall be approved by the President and
Board of Trustees as valid and entitled to be recorded unless and until the
provisions of this Chapter have been complied with.



4-9-3:  PAYMENT SCHEDULE:



   Said connection fees shall be payable in the following manner:



   Sixty percent (60%) shall be paid at the time of approval of the final
plat of subdivision, resubdivision, planned unit development, commercial or
industrial development



   The balance may be paid in equal installments on issuance of the
building permits for each residential, commercial or industrial unit;
provided, however, that in the event said lands are the subject matter of an
annexation agreement, said sums shall be paid at the times and in the manner
provided in said annexation agreement.



   In the case of a commercial or industrial development, after the
development has been fully occupied for a year, any difference owed to the
Village as a result of the actual average daily gallon usage of water
exceeding seventy five percent (75%) of the estimated daily gallon usage of
water shall be paid within sixty (60) days of the determination of the
difference.  If the seventy five percent (75%) of the estimated daily gallon
usage of water exceeds the actual average daily gallon usage of water, any
difference in resulting fees shall be paid to the developer within sixty (60)
days of the determination of the difference.

   A.   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
Title shall be held to be the  minimum    requirements for the promotion
of the public health, safety and welfare.



   B.   Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this Chapter
upon the construction, alteration or maintenance of buildings or structures
are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions
imposed by any other provision of this Title or of any other applicable law,
ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, the regulations which are more
restrictive (or which impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern.



   C.   This Title is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant
or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations of this
Title are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than
such easement, covenant or other private agreement, the requirements of this
Title shall govern.



   D.   No building or structure which was not lawfully existing at the
time of the effective date hereof shall become or be made lawful solely by
reason of the adoption of these provisions; and to the extent that, and in
any manner that, such building or structure is in conflict with the
requirements of this Title, said building or structure remains unlawful
hereunder.



   E.   Nothing contained in this Title shall be deemed to be a
consent, license or permit to locate, construct or maintain any building,
structure or facility, or to carry on any trade, industry, occupation or
activity.



(Amd. Ord. 5418, 7-1-19)

   No building or structure or any part thereof or any appurtenance
thereto shall hereafter be constructed, erected, altered, installed, added
to, enlarged, repaired, converted, removed, demolished or maintained, nor
shall the use, location or occupancy thereof be changed except in conformity
with the provisions of this Code, and no work for which a building permit is
required under the terms of this Chapter or any work with respect to

which is the subject of his or its building permit until a Certificate of

   The code official shall issue such certificate only if, after
inspection, he finds that such building or structure complies with the

the State of Illinois, and that said building or structure has been completed
in accordance with the approved plans and documents filed in support of the
Application for Building Permit relating to said building or structure. 
Such certificate shall show the permitted use for the building or
structure.  A conditional certificate may be issued for the temporary use of

above, or the conditions set forth in Section 5-1-13, Paragraph 111.3 of this
Code.

manages a business or occupation within the Village) to conduct, engage in,
maintain, operate, carry on, or manage a business or occupation without a
Certificate of Occupancy first having been procured from the Village for the
premises of such business or occupation. The fee for processing and issuing a
Certificate of Occupancy (see Section 5-2-9 of this Chapter) shall be doubled

card shall be maintained in such position by the permit holder until the
certificate of occupancy has been issued.



   E.   Re-Inspection Fees: In the event the permittee, contractor or a
subcontractor shall request an inspection and it is found by the building
code official that the construction, erection or installation does not meet
the requirements of this Chapter, or other applicable ordinances of the
Village, and that an additional inspection or inspections shall be necessary,
before any additional inspection shall be made, the permittee, contractor or
subcontractor shall pay to the Development Services Department the fee for
each such additional inspection. See Village Code, Title 5 Chapter 2, Section
7-5.

violation of the provisions of this Chapter, or is being done or has been
done without permit or permits required therefore by any of the provisions of
this Chapter or any other provisions of this Village Code, or is being done
or has been done contrary to the drawings or plans as approved by the
Development Services Department, the building code official is hereby
empowered and required forthwith to issue a stop order directing such
construction, erection, alteration, installation, addition to, enlargement,
conversion of or repair of any building or structure or any part thereof or
appurtenance thereto, to cease immediately. If after a stop order has been
issued, there is any reason to believe that further work is being done or has
been done, the building code official may, among other remedies provided by
law, petition the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, for an injunction
as provided by law against the continuing of such work. (See 5-1-15 of this
code for Violations and Stop Work Order.)

SECTION 111 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY



14.   That Subsections 111.2 and 111.3 shall be revised and Section 114 is
added to read as follows:



   111.2  CERTIFICATE ISSUED: When a building or structure is entitled
thereto, the building code official shall issue a certificate of use and
occupancy within ten days after final inspection and approval. The
certificate shall certify compliance with the provisions of this code and the
purpose for which the building or structure may be used in its several
parts.  (See VC 5-1-4).



   111.3  CONDITIONAL OCCUPANCY PERMIT: The building code official is
authorized to issue a conditional certificate of occupancy before the
completion of the entire work covered by the permit, provided that such
portion or portions shall be occupied safely. The building code official
shall set a time period during which the temporary certificate of occupancy
is valid.  Upon request of the holder of a permit, the building code
official may issue a conditional occupancy permit for a specific building or
structure, or part thereof, before the entire work covered by the permit
shall have been completed, provided that: (1) such portion or portions may be
occupied or used safely prior to full completion of the building, structure
or exterior land improvements without endangering life or public welfare; (2)
the incompletion is due to factors beyond the permit holder's control and
beyond his reasonable scheduling efforts, such as in the case of driveways,
sidewalks, rough and/or final grading, exterior painting, gutters and
downspouts which normally cannot be completed due to inclement weather during
the time period of November 1st through the following May 15th; (3) in the
cases of incomplete items, proof is shown that money is escrowed or otherwise
set aside to complete the improvements; and (4) all parties with an interest
in the building or structure give written concurrence with the issuance of
the conditional occupancy permits.



   The conditional occupancy permit shall be issued in the name of the
permit holder and the individual or business entity occupying the premises.



   In the event that an approved plan for a building is completed,
excepting only landscaping and/or grading requirements, a conditional
certificate of occupancy may be issued upon receipt of a request stating that
(1) the builder intends to complete the uncompleted work within thirty (30)
days (or within ninety (90) days or by June 1, whichever is earlier, if the
request is dated between December 1 and April 1); (2) the builder will
voluntarily provide a five thousand dollar  ($5,000.00) cash deposit (or
check) in exchange for the conditional certificate of occupancy; and (3) the
builder gives the Village the right to enter the property at the Village's
sole option to complete the uncompleted work if said work is not completed
within the time limit set (this right shall survive the closing of any sale
of the property).



   The builder's deposit will be refunded less two hundred and fifty
dollars ($250.00) for program administration and inspection costs if the
uncompleted work is completed within the time limit set. Otherwise, the
Village may, at its sole option, complete the work or have it completed and
refund any remaining money to the builder less three hundred and fifty
dollars ($350.00) for program administration completion and inspection costs.
Acceptance of a builder's deposit creates no liability for the Village to
complete any uncompleted work.



   Builders are under no obligation to participate in this voluntary
program. If they prefer, they may simply complete all work shown on the
approved plan and receive a final certificate of occupancy. (Ord. 3449,
12-4-00).



   111.4 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION: Existing structures legally occupied
during times when work is allowed under an active building permit shall
obtain a Certificate of Completion prior to use of those areas designated.

   DELETE TABLE 504.3 (Table 504.3 has been amended by the Village and
amended Table 503 applies).



   504.3 Automatic sprinkler system increase. Where a building is equipped
throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in accordance with
Section 903.3.1.1, the value specified in Table 503 for maximum building
height is increased by twenty (20) feet (6096 mm) and the maximum number of
stories is increased by one (1). These increases are permitted in addition to
the building area increase in accordance with Sections 506.2 and 506.3.  For
Group R buildings designed of Type III-B Construction the value specified in
Table 503 for maximum building height shall not exceed sixty (60) feet (18
288 mm) or four (4) stories, regardless of type of sprinkler system.



      Exceptions: The use of an automatic sprinkler system to increase

   DELETE: Table 504.4 as written by the Model IBC Code which may conflict
with the Village Code adopting amended Table 503. (Amd. Ord. 5418, 7-1-19)



SECTION 506: MODIFICATIONS TO BUILDING AREA, HEIGHT AND STORIES



42.   That Section 506 shall be revised to read as follows:



   BUILDING AREA MODIFICATIONS: Note: The Village Code building area
calculations are similar to the IBC model codes intent but cannot be used
due to the revision of Section 506.3 (fire sprinkler allowed increases).
Section numbers have been revised for comprehension purposes.



   506.1 GENERAL: The building areas limited by Table 503 shall be
permitted to be increased due to frontage (If) and automatic sprinkler system
protection (Is) in accordance with Equation 5-1:



   Aa = {At + [At × If] + [At × Is]}    (Equation 5-1)



   where:



   Aa = Allowable building area per story (square feet).



   At = Tabular building area per story in accordance with Table 503
(square feet).



   If = Area increase factor due to frontage as calculated in accordance
with Section 506.2.



   Is = Area increase factor due to sprinkler protection as calculated in
accordance with Section 506.3.



   506.2 FRONTAGE INCREASE: Every building shall adjoin or have access to
a public way to receive a building area increase for frontage. Where a
building has more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its perimeter on a public
way or open space having a width of not less than twenty (20) feet (6096 mm),
the frontage increase shall be determined in accordance with Equation 5-2:



   If = [F/P - 0.25]W/30    (Equation 5-2)



   where:



   If = Area increase due to frontage.



   F = Building perimeter that fronts on a public way or open space having
20 feet (6096 mm) open  minimum width (feet).



   P = Perimeter of entire building (feet).



   W = Width of public way or open space (feet) in accordance with Section
506.2.1.



      506.2.1 WIDTH LIMITS: To apply this section the value of W shall
be not less than twenty (20) feet (6096 mm). Where the value of W varies
along the perimeter of the building, the calculation performed in accordance
with Equation 5-2 shall be based on the weighted average calculated in
accordance with Equation 5-3 for portions of the exterior perimeter walls
where the value of W is greater than or equal to twenty (20) feet (6096 mm).
Where the value of W is greater than thirty (30) feet (9144 mm), a value of
thirty (30) feet (9144 mm) shall be used in calculating the weighted average,
regardless of the actual width of the open space. W shall be measured
perpendicular from the face of the building to the closest interior lot line.
Where the building fronts on a public way, the entire width of the public way
shall be used. Where two (2) or more buildings are on the same lot, W shall
be measured from the exterior face of each building to the opposing exterior
face of each adjacent building, as applicable.



      Weighted average W = (L1[ ][ ] w1 + L2[ ][ ] w2 + L3[ ][ ]
w3)/F.    (Equation 5-3)



      where:



      Ln = Length of a portion of the exterior perimeter wall.



      wn = Width of open space associated with that portion of the
exterior perimeter wall.



      F = Building perimeter that fronts on a public way or open space
having a width of 20 feet (6096 mm) or more.



      Exception: Where the building meets the requirements of Section
507, as applicable, except for compliance with the 60-foot (18 288 mm) public
way or yard requirement, and the value of W is greater than 30 feet (9144
mm), the value of W divided by 30 shall be limited to a maximum of 2.



      506.2.2 OPEN SPACE LIMITS: Such open space shall be either on the
same lot or dedicated for public use and shall be accessed from a street or
approved fire lane.



      Section 506.2.3 for Single Occupancy multi-story buildings is
regulated in amended Section 506.4. 



      Section 506.2.4 for Multi-Occupancy multi-story buildings is
regulated in amended Section 506.5.



   506.3  AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEM INCREASE: Where a building is
protected throughout with an approved automatic sprinkler system in
accordance with Section 903.3.1.1, the area limitation in Table 503 is
permitted to be increased by one hundred percent (100%) (I s = 100 percent)
for buildings with more than one (1) story above grade and a two hundred
percent (200%) (I s = 200 percent) increase is allowed for single story
buildings. 1 story Religious A-3 Occupancy Classifications allow a three
hundred percent (300%) area increase and a two hundred percent (200%) area
increase for Religious buildings more than one (1)-story above grade.



      EXCEPTIONS:



      a.   Group H-1, H-2 or H-3 (Use groups not permitted within
the Village).



      b.   R-1 hotels having 2 or more stories above grade,

smaller reinforcing bar sizes with closer spacings that provide an equivalent
cross-sectional area of reinforcement per unit length of wall are permitted.



      4.   Concrete cover for reinforcement measured from the inside
face of the wall shall not be less than 3/4 inch (19.1 mm). Concrete cover
for reinforcement measured from the outside face of the wall shall not be
less than 1.5 inches (38 mm) for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than two
(2) inches (51 mm) for larger bars.



      5.   Concrete shall have a specified compressive strength, fc,
of not less than 2,500 psi (17.2 MPa) at twenty-eight (28) days.



      6.   The unfactored axial load per linear foot of wall shall
not exceed 1.2 tfc , where t is the specified wall thickness in inches.



      The thickness of foundation walls shall comply with the
requirements of Table 1807.1.6.2 for plain concrete walls.  In all cases,
foundation walls shall be connected to footings with at least #4
reinforcement vertical dowel bars spaced no greater than 48" on center unless
additional or larger dowel bars are required by the licensed design
professional.

their original designs, but also restricts the misuse of the code by
circumventing its intent of protecting the public through reduced fire
ratings due to alterations not requiring one hundred percent (100%)
compliance. 



   3401.2 CHANGE OF OCCUPANCY APPROVAL:  No change of occupancy shall be
made to any structure which will subject the structure to any provisions that
would place the building in a different division of the same use group of
occupancies or in a different group of occupancies listed in Chapter 3 of
this code, unless the building is made to comply with this code for such a
division or group of occupancies. The building code official shall certify
that such structure meets the intent of the provisions of law governing
building construction for the proposed new occupancy, and that such change of
occupancy does not result in any greater hazard to the public health, safety
or welfare. Any change of occupancy shall meet the requirements of this
Chapter and Chapter 1 of this Code.



   Occupancy changes must adequately address a building's existing hazards
and accessibility before a Use or Occupancy revision.  Design criteria must
include building subjects such as: construction types, heights, areas,
stories, exterior walls, fire hazards, exiting, accessibility, parking,
mechanical, ventilation, electrical, plumbing and energy conservation for a
Use/Occupancy change.



   EXAMPLE:  Building construction using the minimum requirements allowed
for a single family residence then converted into a restaurant (R-3 to an
A-2).   



   3401.3  ACCESSIBILITY TO EXISTING BUILDINGS: Existing public buildings
and structures shall comply with the Accessibility Code as regulated by the
State of Illinois (410/ILCS 25/1 Environmental Barriers Act as amended) (Amd.
Ord. 5418, 7-1-19)

      Trench Foundations: are allowed for small, less than 400 square
foot, 1-story additions which may include enclosed Porches (see definitions
below).  Concrete walls are required to be ten (10) inches for supporting
exterior walls which may include glass and/or brick veneer.  A foundation's
frost depth is to be at least 42 inches below exterior grade level.  Trench
foundations must be flared or belled at the bottom to a minimum width of
twelve (12) inches and connected to the existing foundation walls with re-bar
pins of 5/8-inch diameter to form a continuous foundation.  These pins are
to be placed twelve (12) inches from the top and twelve (12) inches from the
bottom of the new foundation.



      Post Foundations: Are permitted for open decks and porches. 
Minimum diameter piers shall be 8" for decks and 12" for roofed over decks,
at least 42 inches below grade.  Pier foundations shall not be located
within the existing foundation's over-dig unless adequate bearing is achieved
for soil bearing needs.



   Definitions - Additions:



   Porch:  An exterior Porch is a roofed over deck or patio attached to
the dwelling and is open or screened as an exterior accessory use.  An
exterior porch may have exterior walls no higher than eighteen (18) inches
above the floor, with the remainder of the perimeter open.  Open porches are
exterior structures allowing the use of concrete piers and posts sized to
support the deck, roof and uplift loads only.  When windows, glass and doors
are placed in exterior walls, the porch is classified as an enclosed interior
addition for the purpose of foundation design regulations. 



   Interior (Enclosed) Additions: An enclosed porch is classified an
interior addition (such as sunrooms, 3-season room, cold porch etc.) and
requires a footing/foundation to be continuous for perimeter walls. Smaller
single story additions allow the use of a trenched or formed foundation when
additions are considered an enclosed structure (see Trench Foundation
below).  Note: glass installation is governed as part of exterior walls. 



   Open decks: are level floor surface structures built-up above the
ground levels having no roof or walls for enclosures. Decks typically include
guardrails around open perimeter of the deck surface and steps leading to
grade.  Decks with more than 30 inches in height above grade require
guardrails, which shall be at least 36 inches in height measured vertically
above the walking surface. Guardrail opening must have spacing such that a 4
inch sphere cannot pass (B 1021.2 & 1021.3).  Open porch/decks are an
exterior structure allowing the use of concrete piers and posts sized to
support deck, roof loads and uplift only.



   Patios:  are classified as exterior finished ground walking surfaces
without walls or a roofed over structure and do not require foundation
walls.  Patios typically are paved with brick, tiles or even stone and open
to the sky.  Patios are ground coverings for the purposes of lot coverage. A
roof covered patio would be classified as a Porch when attached to a
residence or Gazebo when detached.  Gazebos are limited to 200 square feet.

control of residential real estate, whether as a legal or equitable owner

violation that is ordered by the code official or his or her designee that
would address the conditions that are endangering the health and safety of an
inhabitant, within seven (7) days of service of notice identifying the

5-8-1  ADMINISTRATION GENERAL PROVISIONS:



5-8-1-1  PURPOSE:



   1.   Minimum Residential Standards:  The purpose of this Code is to
provide minimum standards for the protection of the life, safety, health,
welfare, and property of rental residential owners and tenants, as well as
that of the general public.



   2.   Maximum Occupant Loads: To prevent the overcrowding of rental
dwellings by requiring compliance with minimum space standards per occupant
for each dwelling unit.



   3.   Prevent Slum Areas:  To facilitate the enforcement of minimum
standards for the maintenance of existing residential buildings and thus to
prevent slums and blight.



   4.   Maintain Property Values: To preserve the value of land and
buildings throughout the Village of Orland Park.



   5.   Crime-Free Housing: To reduce and prevent crimes from occurring
within rental housing and neighborhoods.



5-8-1-1-1:  CRIME PREVENTION: 



   This Code is intended to promote the reduction in crime with
regulations that require the land/building owners to be annually licensed by
the Village.  A Rental Housing License will be issued when application forms
are completed with the accurate tenant records as required by the Orland Park
Police Department. "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" (CPED)
will also be part of building construction standards. 



   Crime Free general reference Sections (5-8-2, 5-8-3-2, 5-8-3-3 item 6,
5-8-4-3 item 13, 5-8-4-6)



5-8-1-2:  EFFECTIVE DATE:



   This Code shall take effect and be in full force immediately upon
approval of the Village Board of Trustees. After the effective date of this
Code it shall be unlawful for any owner, as defined herein, to lease or
operate Residential Rental Housing without registering each Rental Unit with
the Village of Orland Park and obtaining a license to operate it as
Residential Rental Housing and complying with the provisions of this Code,
together with other applicable codes and ordinances of the Village of Orland
Park.



5-8-1-3:  INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF CODE:



   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Code
shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the
public health, safety, and welfare.  This Code and The International
Property Maintenance Code, 2006 or latest edition adopted by the Village (VC
5-8) shall apply, as minimum standards for maintenance of Residential Rental
Housing.  Where the requirements of this Code vary from any other lawfully
adopted Village or state laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, codes, deed
restrictions or covenants, the more restrictive or that imposing the higher
standards shall govern.  The Village does not enforce any private covenants
between land owners or tenants or finally determine conflicts between
neighboring property owners.



5-8-1-4:  SCOPE:



   This Code shall apply to all real property located within the
incorporated limits of Orland Park, Illinois, which contains one or more
Rental Units, as defined herein.



5-8-1-5:  SEVERABILITY:



   Should any section or provision of this Code be declared by the courts
to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the Code as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so
declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.



5-8-1-6:  RESPONSIBLE DEPARTMENT FOR CODE:



   The Village of Orland Park, Illinois has created this "Rental Housing
Code" pursuant to its home rule powers and has designated the Development
Services Department as the enforcement body. The Director of Development
Services, or his/her designee, has the authority for enforcing the provisions
of this Code and shall serve to render interpretations of this Code. The
Crime Free Rental Housing Program will be coordinated by the Orland Park
Police Department through the Chief of Police or his/her designee.



5-8-1-7:  OCCUPANCY, LICENSE, AND REGISTRATION:



   No Dwelling Unit may be occupied by other than the owner and owner's
family without having been licensed, registered and inspected.  The
provisions of this Code's subsection 5-8-3 shall apply for Registration and
Bi-Annual inspections of any Rental Unit within the Village.  Occupancy
limits shall be determined by the applicable Village Codes.  No person,
corporation or business entity of any kind or nature whatsoever, shall engage
in the business of renting any Dwelling Unit to the public, or operating a
Rental Dwelling or Dwelling Unit, rooming house or rooming unit, unless a
valid and current Residential Rental License has been issued by the Village
Clerk for the specific location.  This agreement is not intended to apply to
licensed professionals acting as brokers or agents, unless licensed
professionals are owners or managers of property subject to this Code.  No
person shall rent or occupy a Dwelling Unit or rent or occupy any rooming
house unit unless a current valid license has been issued for that specific
location.  This licensing requirement shall not apply to group homes
governed by the Specialized Living Centers Act, 405 ILCS 25/1 et seq.,
dealing with the developmentally disabled, or other similar uses governed by
state or federal laws, rules or regulations.  No license shall be issued or
renewed unless the owner or operator agrees in the application to such
inspections as may be required pursuant to this chapter.



5-8-1-8:  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



5-8-1-8-1:  ENFORCEMENT:

this Code to such persons as are appropriate for conformance through
respective Department chain of command.  The Development Services Director
or the Chief of Police, may, when circumstances dictate, call upon the Police
Department, County, State, Fire District or other authorities, agencies,

housing which constitute violations of this Code or other duly enacted

landlord or agent as soon as reasonably possible.

enforcement official with the exception of personal items.



      4.   Denial of Access:



         Except in the case of an emergency, if a tenant or property
owner denies an inspector access to a rental property, the Director of
Development Services or his/her designee shall apply to the Circuit Court for
the issuance of an administrative search warrant for inspections under this
Code.



      5.   Required Inspections:



         Systematic Residential Rental Property inspections will be
conducted tri-annually (every three years). Inspections based upon complaints
received will be conducted as received and determined as necessary by the

5-8-1-8-3:  VIOLATIONS:



   Violations of this Code and fines shall be as stated in this Chapter or
as specified in the Administration Section 1-4 of the Village Code, if no
fine is stated in this Chapter.



      1.   Time Limit for Removal:



         When a licensing inspection of a Rental Residential
Property reveals any violations of applicable codes, a compliance time frame
will be set by the inspector/code official.  In establishing a compliance
time frame, the inspector/code official shall determine the reasonable
minimal time necessary to correct the violations based upon the number and
severity of the violations.  The Village shall send notice to the property
owner or the listed property agent by regular U.S. mail at the last address
provided on the most recent license application.  Said notice shall include
the following:

identification.



            b.    A statement listing the violations of
applicable codes.

re-inspection will occur.



            d.    An explanation that if upon completion of
the licensing re-inspection, the requirements of applicable Village codes
have not been met, it will be recommended to the Director of Development
Services that the license be suspended or revoked.



      2.   Immediate Action:



         Notice of violations involving imminent danger to the life,
safety, health, welfare and/or property of the landlord and/or tenants may be

include but not be limited to personal delivery, registered or certified
mail, or posting of an appropriate notice on the premises.



      3.   Occupancy Denial:



         In the case of imminent danger or fire hazard, structural

premises vacated pending such repair or correction.



      4.   Citation Issuance:

corrective action, the violation has not, in the Village's reasonable
judgment, been satisfactorily corrected, then the Village may issue citations
in accordance with provisions of this Code, suspend or revoke the license for
the affected unit or units, and have the rental unit vacated. Citations for
local municipal violations are adjudicated through the Village of Orland Park
Administrative Adjudication of Non Vehicular Code Violations, Title 1,
Chapter 14.



            a.    Units vacated under this subsection shall be
posted with signs indicating that the unit has been determined to be
"Illegal", or if applicable "Unfit for Habitation"' and that occupancy is
prohibited until the rental unit has been inspected to verify that the
violation has been corrected.



            b.    Any person who defaces or removes a posted
sign as described in 4a above without the approval of the Village shall be in
violation of this Code.



      5.   Time Limit to Vacate a Building or Unit:



         If notification has been presented to the landlord that the
property is not properly licensed or that the license has been suspended or
revoked, the rental property or properties shall be vacated within sixty (60)
days of notification by the Village.



            a.   If said property is not vacated within the 
sixty (60) day period, the landlord will be responsible for all fines as set
forth in this Code.  Citations will be issued with a mandatory court
appearance. Fines imposed upon rental property owners who have initiated
statutory eviction proceedings against tenant(s) pursuant to the Crime Free
Program of this Code (Section 5-8-3-2) shall be waived so long as such
eviction proceedings are pending and being actively pursued.  This waiver
does not relate to fines resulting from property maintenance violations. 



            b.    Notification will be either personally
delivered or mailed to the land-lord or property agent as listed on the most
recent registration application.  This notice to the tenants and occupants
will be posted:

for this structure has been revoked or the owner has failed to license this
residential rental property pursuant to Chapter 5 Title 8 of the Village of
Orland Park Code.



               2   You must vacate this structure within
sixty (60) days of the date of this notice.



               3   If you fail to vacate this structure,
you will be in violation of this above referenced Code and subject to
penalties and fines with a minimum of $250.00 and a maximum of $1,000 for
each day you are found to be in violation with a mandatory court appearance.



      6   Hearing/ Right of Appeal:



         Whenever a property owner gets notice of a permit denial,
suspension or threatened revocation and required vacating of a license issued
under this Chapter, the licensee shall have the right to request a hearing. 
The request shall be made within seven (7) days of receipt of the notice. 
The request shall be made by certified or registered mail, overnight courier
or hand delivery to the Development Services Department.



         Whenever a request for a hearing is made, the Village
President shall call a hearing by the procedures in Section 7-1-16 C of this
Code.  Appeal of the decision rendered following such a hearing may be taken
pursuant to Section 7-1-16 D of this Code.



      7   "Crime Free Rental Housing":



         The landlord or managing agent will be in violation of this
Code if he/she has not complied with all "Crime Free Housing" requirements as
stated in Section 5-8-3-2.  The Chief of Police or his/her designee shall
designate a Crime-Free Rental Housing co-coordinator, who shall be
responsible for conducting the Crime Free Housing Seminars and maintain a
list of the attendees and their dates of attendance.



      8   Unfit Properties:



         The Village may prohibit persons from entering or
occupying, except for repair related activity, any Rental Unit, building or
structure, including utility and out buildings, found to be unfit, found not
to comply with Village codes or ordinances, or that poses dangerous, unsafe,
or unhealthy conditions for the building's occupants, passers-by, or the
general public.  Unfit properties shall be posted with appropriate language
that does not permit occupancy.  Any person, not the owner, who enters,
occupies, uses or any person, including the owner, who permits others to
enter, occupy or use the structure after such a posting shall be charged with
trespassing. (Village Code Title 8, Chapter. 6 5-1) Each day the Rental Unit
building or structure is entered, occupied or used following such a posting
shall be considered a separate offense.



5-8-1-8-4:  PENALTIES:



   Any person, firm, corporation, or other entity violating any provision
of this Chapter shall be subject to the penalties of all applicable codes and
such person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall be deemed guilty of  a
separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which such
violation is committed, continued, or permitted, and upon finding that a
violation has occurred, shall be fined in accordance with the appropriate
provisions of this Chapter and  according to the fine schedule located in

6-2-3:  ABATEMENT:



   Whenever any nuisance shall be found on any premises within the Village
contrary to any provisions of this Chapter, the President of the Board of
Trustees is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to cause the same to be
summarily abated, in such manner as he may direct.



   Inspection:  For the purpose of carrying the foregoing provisions of
this Chapter into effect, it shall be the duty of such officers or officials
as may be directed or deputized by the President of the Board of Trustees,
from time to time to ascertain and cause all nuisances arising under this
Chapter to be abated.  In all cases where a nuisance shall be found in any
building, or upon any grounds or other premises which can be charged by
assessment with the expense of removal, notice shall be given to the owner or
occupant of the building or other premises, when known and can be found, to
remove the nuisance; and in case of his refusal or neglect to comply with
such notice, the officers or officials shall abate the same and report the
expense thereof to the President and Board of Trustees.



   Abatement Notice:  In all cases where a nuisance shall be found in any
building or upon any ground or other premises within the jurisdiction of the
Village, not less than twenty four (24) hours' notice may be given in
writing, signed by the officer or official so directed by the President of
the Board of Trustees, to the owner or occupant or person in possession,
charge or control of such building or other premises, if known and can be
found, to remove such nuisance.  It shall not be necessary in any case for
the notice to specify the manner in which any nuisance shall be abated,
unless the officer or official shall deem it advisable so to do. If the
person so notified shall neglect or refuse to abate the same in accordance
with such notice, he shall be chargeable with the expense which may be
incurred in the removal thereof, to be collected by suit or otherwise in
addition to any fine or penalty which may be imposed by law.



   Emergency Situations:  In an emergency situation where unless the
Village acts, there is an immediate hazard, a serious risk to the public, or
an imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare from a nuisance
existing in the Village, if a reasonable effort under the circumstances has
been made to notify the person causing or permitting the nuisance and that
person is either unavailable or unwilling to abate the nuisance, said
nuisance may be abated without further notice, and a notice describing the
action taken to abate the nuisance posted on the property.  (Ord. 3774,
7-7-03)



   Where the Village acts to abate a nuisance, the expenses incurred for
the abatement shall be chargeable to the person causing or permitting the
nuisance to continue or to the owner of the building, structure or premises
on or from which the nuisance was abated.  (Ord. 3320, 12-6-99)

   For the purpose of this Chapter, whenever any of the following words,
terms or definitions are used herein, they shall have the meaning ascribed to
them in this Section:



   Acoustical Terminology, Definitions of:



   All acoustical terminology shall be that contained in ANSI S1.l
"Acoustical Terminology".



   ANSI:  American National Standards Institute or its successor bodies.



   ARI:  Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or its successor
bodies.



   ASHRAE:  American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
Air-Conditioning Engineers or its successor bodies.



   ASTM:  American Society for Testing Materials or its successor bodies.



   DECIBEL:  A unit for measuring the volume of a sound, equal to the
logarithm of the ratio of the intensity of the sound to the intensity of an
arbitrarily chosen standard sound; abbreviated "dB".



   DISCRETE TONE:  A discrete tone is a sound wave whose instantaneous
sound pressure varies essentially as a simple sinusoidal function of the time.



   FLUCTUATING NOISE:  A fluctuating noise is a noise whose sound
pressure level varies significantly but does not equal the ambient
environmental level more than once during the period of observation.



   IMPULSIVE NOISE:  Impulsive noise is characterized by brief excursions
of sound pressure (acoustic impulses which significantly exceed the ambient
environmental sound pressure.  The duration of a single impulse is usually
less than one second.



   INTERMITTENT NOISE:  An intermittent noise is a noise whose sound
pressure level equals the ambient environmental level two (2) or more times
during the period of observation.  The period of time during which the level
of the noise remains at an essentially constant value different from that of
the ambient is on the order of one second or more.



   IEC:  International Electrotechnical Commission or its successor
bodies.



   ISO:  International Organization for Standardization or its successor
bodies.



   MOTOR VEHICLE:  A motor vehicle is any passenger vehicle, truck,
truck-trailer, trailer or semi-trailer propelled or drawn by mechanical power.



   NONSTEADY NOISE:  A nonsteady noise is a noise whose level shifts
significantly during the period of observation.



   PERIOD OF OBSERVATION:  The period of observation is the time interval
during which acoustical data are obtained.  The period of observation is
determined by the characteristics of the noise being measured and should also
be at least ten (10) times as long as the response time of the
instrumentation.  The greater the variance in indicated sound level, the
longer must be the observation time for a given expected accuracy of the
measurement.



   SAE:  Society of Automotive Engineers or its successor bodies.



   SOUND LEVEL (Noise Level):  For air-borne sound, sound level (noise
level) is a weighted sound pressure level, obtained by the use of metering
characteristics and the A-weighing as specified in the referenced standards
(Section 1.3). When the A-weighing is employed, it must be indicated.



   SOUND PRESSURE LEVEL:  The sound pressure level, in decibels, of a
sound is twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of
the pressure of the sound to the reference sound pressure.  Unless otherwise
specified, the effective (rms) pressure is to be understood.



   The reference sound pressure is 20 uN/M2.



   STEADY NOISE:  A noise whose level remains essentially constant (i.e.,
fluctuations are negligibly small) during the period of observation is a
steady noise.



6-4-2:  NOISE CONTROL REGULATIONS:



   The following restrictions and regulations are hereby established for
the enforcement of noise control within the Village.

6-9-1:  DEFINITIONS:



   As used in this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:



   "Control Area" means an electrical system bounded by interconnection
(tie-line) metering and telemetry.  It controls generation directly to
maintain its interchange schedule with other control areas and contributes to
frequency regulation of the interconnection.



   "Control Area Emergency" means that Control Area is at risk of having
to shed firm load, having taken or committed to take all feasible mitigating
action short of shedding firm load and firm sales.



   "Controlled rotating interruptions of electrical service" means the
implementation of a plan to curtail electric service to firm load customers
for a short period of time and rotating this curtailment of electric service
through different areas within the electric utility's service territory in a
situation where the demand has exceeded or is at significant risk of
exceeding the supply of electricity available to the electric utility.  The
action of an electric utility to interrupt or curtail electric service to a
customer participating in or taking service under an interruptible or
curtailable rate is not included in this definition of a "controlled rotating
interrupting of electric service."



   "Emergency energy plan" means the portions of the Emergency load
conservation procedures, which immediately precede and include the controlled
rotating interruption of electrical service to firm load customers within the
Village.  The Emergency energy plan shall include the following steps:



      (1)   a request for emergency help from neighboring utilities;



      (2)   a declaration of a control area emergency;



      (3)   a public appeal for voluntary curtailment of electricity
use; and,



      (4)   implementation of the plan for controlled rotating
interruptions of electrical service.



   "Emergency load conservation procedures" means a planned course of
action developed by an electric utility company to be implemented in
emergency situations when the demand for electricity exceeds, or is at
significant risk of exceeding, the supply of electricity available to the
electric utility.



   "Electric utility company" or "electric utility" means any person or
entity engaged in the business of distributing, transmitting, or otherwise
delivering electricity, regardless of its source, for use or consumption
within the Village.  This term shall not include any person or entity that
delivers electricity to fewer than 50 customers within the Village.



6-9-2:  SUBMITTAL OF EMERGENCY ENERGY PLAN:



   (a)   Every electric utility company must have adopted an emergency
energy plan no later than 30 days after the effective date of this chapter,
or within 30 days after becoming an electric utility company, whichever is
later.  Every such electric utility company shall submit to the Village
Manager or the Village Manager's designee an emergency energy plan adopted by
the company no later than 30 days after the effective date of this chapter,
or within 24 hours of the time the plan is adopted, whichever is later.  The
electric utility company shall be required to examine and update as needed
its emergency energy plan at least annually.  The electric utility company
shall notify the foregoing public official(s) in writing of any material
revisions to its plan and the rationale for said revisions within five (5)
business days of the time said revisions are made.



   (b)   The emergency energy plan shall include, at a minimum,
information detailing:



      (1)   Circumstances that would require the implementation of
the emergency energy plan;



      (2)   Stages of the emergency energy plan;



      (3)   The approximate geographic limits of each outage area
provided for in the emergency energy plan;



      (4)   The approximate number of customers within each outage
area provided for in the emergency energy plan;



      (5)   The police facilities, fire stations, hospitals, nursing
homes, schools, day care centers, senior citizen centers, community health
centers, dialysis centers, community mental health centers, correctional
facilities, stormwater and wastewater treatment or pumping facilities, and
water- pumping stations that have been identified by the Village and persons
on life-support systems that are known to the company, and that could be
affected by controlled rotating interruptions of electric service under the
emergency energy plan; and 



      (6)   The anticipated sequence and duration of intentional
interruptions of electric service to each outage area under the emergency
energy plan.



6-9-3:  REVIEW OF PLAN:



   Upon submittal of the emergency energy plan to the Village, the Village
shall review the emergency energy plan in order to determine if the emergency
energy plan is complete and to assure appropriate coordination with public
health and safety agencies.  The Village may reject the emergency energy
plan if it does not contain all the information required under Section
6-9-2(b), in which case the Village shall notify the electric utility company
in writing of said rejection and the reasons therefor.  The electric utility
company shall thereafter submit a complete emergency energy plan to the
Village no later than thirty (30) days after such notice is sent by the
Village.



   The Village and the electric utility shall work cooperatively to:



      (1)   Identify customers and facilities for which a controlled
rotating interruption of electric servicewould require heightened response by
Village public health and safety agencies,



      (2)   Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on public
health and safety, and



      (3)   Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on the duties
of the Village's public health and safety agencies.



6-9-4:  IMPLEMENTATION OF EMERGENCY ENERGY PLAN:



   Whenever an electric utility company determines that it may be
necessary to implement a controlled rotating interruption of electrical
service due to the demand for electricity exceeding, or being at significant
risk of exceeding, the supply of electricity available to the electric
utility company, the electric utility company shall do the following:



      (1)   Take appropriate action in preparation for implementing
a controlled rotating interruption of electric service and notify the
appropriate electric utility company personnel, and



      (2)   Notify the Village Manager or the Village Manager's
designee that the electric utility company will be implementing its emergency
energy plan.  The notification shall be made pursuant to a notification
procedure approved by the Village Manager after consultation with the
appropriate Village departments.  The Village Manager or the Village
Manager's designee may waive the notice requirement to accommodate exigent
circumstances.



   Subsequent to providing the notice as required above, an electric
utility company shall reasonably and separately advise the designated Village
officials when it implements each of the steps of the emergency energy
plan.  Such steps shall include the following:



      (1)   A request for emergency help from neighboring utilities;



      (2)   A declaration of a control area emergency;



      (3)   A public appeal for voluntary curtailment of electricity
use.



   The electric utility company shall give a separate notice to the
Village Manager or the Village Manager's designee, immediately upon the
determination that there will be a controlled rotating interruption of
electric service pursuant to the emergency energy plan.  The notification
shall include the areas to be interrupted; the sequence and estimated
duration of the service outage for each area; and the affected feeders and
number of affected customers in each area.  Whenever practical, the
notification shall be made at least two hours prior to the time of the
outages, and in no case shall the notification be made less than 30 minutes
prior to the outages, if the company is aware that controlled rotating
interruptions may be required.



   Notification required by this section shall be in addition to any
notification requirements set forth in any applicable franchise agreement or
franchise ordinance, or as may be required by applicable federal or State law
or regulation.



6-9-5:  VIOLATIONS; ENFORCEMENT:



   Any electric utility company that knowingly violates this chapter or
any rules promulgated thereunder shall be subject to a fine according to the
fine schedule located in Appendix B for each offense of which such person
shall be convicted.  Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.



   The Village may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an
injunction or order to compel the other party to comply with the provisions
of this chapter.



(Amd. Ord. 5224, 10-2-17)



6-9-6:  CONSTRUCTION:



   Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to preclude or interfere
with the implementation by an electric utility company of measures necessary
to assure the provision of adequate, efficient, reliable and environmentally
safe service, as required by the Illinois Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS
5/1-101 et seq.).  Nothing set forth in this Chapter shall be deemed to
modify the terms of any existing franchise agreement or franchise ordinance
otherwise applicable to any electric utility company, or to excuse any
performance required by such agreement or ordinance, or to limit any
authority that may be exercised pursuant to such agreement or ordinance, or
to limit any remedy that may be available under such agreement or ordinance.



6-9-7:  SEVERABILITY:



   Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this
Chapter be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court or agency of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not
affect any of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or
sections of this Chapter, since the same would have been enacted by the Board
of Trustees without the incorporation in this Chapter of any such invalid or
unconstitutional word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section. (Ord.
3306, 10/19/99)

6-10-3:  SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES:



   (1)    Whenever a police officer has probable cause to believe that
a motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this
Section, the police officer shall cause the motor vehicle to be removed or
towed to a facility authorized by the Village.  When the motor vehicle is
removed or towed, the police officer shall notify any person identifying
himself or herself as the owner of record of the motor vehicle or any person
who is found to be in control of the motor vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation(s), if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and of
the motor vehicle owner of records right to request a preliminary hearing
as provided in this Section.  Said motor vehicle shall be impounded pending
the completion of the hearings provided for in this Section, unless the owner
of record of the motor vehicle posts with the Village a cash bond as set
forth in subsection 4 below.



   (2)    A police officer who has probable cause to believe that a
motor vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment pursuant to this Section
shall first ascertain whether the seizure and impoundment is necessary and
reasonable under the circumstances.  If in the judgment of the police
officer then present, a person authorized by the owner of record or the

lawful immediate removal of the motor vehicle, and said motor vehicle is not
required to be held as evidence in regard to the violation, the police
officer shall allow that individual to promptly remove the motor vehicle
without it being subject to seizure and impoundment if seizure and
impoundment of the motor vehicle is discretionary pursuant to subsection
2(10) above or seizure and impoundment of the motor vehicle is contemplated
pursuant to subsections 2(1) through (9) above. 



6-10-4:  POSTING A BOND:



   If a bond in the amount of five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00) is

owner of record, upon the payment by the owner of record of the towing and
storage costs to the applicable towing company.  If an administrative fee is
imposed pursuant to subsection 6(2) below, the bond shall be applied to said
fee; provided, in the event that a violation of this Section is not proven,
the bond shall be returned to the person posting the bond.  All bond money
posted pursuant to this Section shall be held by the Village until a hearing
officer issues a decision, or, if there is judicial review pursuant to
subsection 10, until a reviewing court issues a final decision.



6-10-5:  PRELIMINARY HEARING:



   Where the owner of record of a motor vehicle seized under the
provisions of this Section makes a request, in writing and filed with the
Chief of Police or the Chief of Polices designee, for a preliminary
hearing within twelve (12) hours after the seizure of the motor vehicle, the
Chief of Police or the Chief of Polices designee must conduct a
preliminary hearing within twenty-four (24) hours after the request for a
preliminary hearing is received by the Village; provided that if the date for
the preliminary hearing falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the
preliminary hearing will be held on the next business day following the
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.  For purposes of this subsection, the
following shall apply:



   (1)    All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the preliminary hearing.



   (2)   The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the
preliminary hearing, and hearsay testimony shall be allowed, and shall be
admissible.



   (3)    If, after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the
Chief of Police or the Chief of Polices designee determines that there is
probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle was used as provided in
subsection 2 above, the Chief of Police or the Chief of Polices designee
shall order the continued impoundment of the motor vehicle, unless the owner
of record of the motor vehicle posts a cash bond with the Village in the
amount of five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00), and pays the towing and
storage costs to the applicable tow company, as set forth in subsection 4
above.



   (4)    If the Chief of Police or the Chief of Polices designee
determines that there is not probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle
was used as provided in subsection 2 above, the motor vehicle shall be
returned to the owner of record of the motor vehicle without any fees or
other costs, but the owner of record shall be responsible to pay any towing
or storage charges to the applicable tow company.



6-10-6:  PLEA HEARING/EVIDENTIARY HEARING:



   (1)    Notice of Hearing.  Within ten (10) days after a motor
vehicle is impounded pursuant to this Section, the Village shall notify the
owner of record of the date, time and location of a plea hearing that shall
be conducted, pursuant to this subsection 6. Such notice shall be mailed by
certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of record, as shown on
the records of the Illinois Secretary of State.  Notice by certified mail
need not be given when the owner of record of the motor vehicle has been
personally served with notice, in written form, of the time, date and
location of the plea hearing. The plea hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing officer, designated by the Village Manager.  The owner of record
shall appear at a plea hearing and enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.  If
a plea of guilty is entered, or if the owner of record fails to appear, the
cause shall be disposed of at that time, with an order/default order in favor
of the Village, which order/default order shall require the payment to the
Village of the five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00) administrative fee
and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the continued
impoundment of the motor vehicle until the owner of record pays to the
Village the five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00) administrative fee and
towing and storage costs to the applicable towing company.  If the owner of
record pleads not guilty, an evidentiary hearing shall be scheduled and held
no later than forty-five (45) days after the motor vehicle was impounded,
unless continued by the hearing officer.  All interested persons shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the evidentiary hearing.  At
any time prior to the evidentiary hearing date, the hearing officer may, at
the request of either the Village or the owner of record, direct witnesses to
appear and give testimony at the evidentiary hearing.  The formal rules of
evidence shall not apply at the evidentiary hearing, and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible. 



   (2)  If, after the evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the motor vehicle was
used in connection with a violation set forth in subsection 2 above, the
hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor
vehicle civilly liable to the Village for an administrative fee in the amount
of five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00), and require the motor vehicle
to continue to be impounded until the owner of record pays the administrative
fee to the Village, plus applicable towing and storage costs to the
applicable tow company. The five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00)
administrative fee shall be a debt due to the Village.  If a cash bond has
been posted pursuant to subsection 4 or 5(3) above, the bond shall be applied
to the administrative fee.  If the owner of record fails to appear at the
evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor
of the Village, which order shall require the payment to the Village of the
five hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00) administrative fee and towing and
storage costs to the applicable tow company, and the continued impoundment of
the motor vehicle until the owner of record pays to the Village the five
hundred and no/100 dollars ($500.00) administrative fee and towing and
storage costs to the applicable towing company.  If the hearing officer
finds no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the
immediate return of the owner of records motor vehicle without any fee or
other costs, or, if a cash bond had previously been posted, the cash bond
shall be returned, but the owner of record shall be responsible for any
towing or storage charges to the applicable tow company.



   (3)    At the evidentiary hearing, the violation citation shall be
prima facie evidence that the violation was committed as provided in the
citation, and the burden of proof shall be upon the owner of record to prove
that the violation was not committed.   



6-10-7:  DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED MOTOR VEHICLES:



   (1)    If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not
paid within thirty (30) days after an administrative fee is imposed against
an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearings provided
in subsection 6 above, or who admits guilt at the plea hearing, the motor
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner
provide by law for the disposition of unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to
625 ILCS 5/1-100, et seq., as amended.  In all other cases, if the
administrative fee and applicable towing and storage costs to the applicable
tow company are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of time
by which administrative review of the hearing officers determination may
be sought pursuant to subsection 10 below, or within thirty (30) days after
an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the
Village, whichever is applicable, the motor vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed
and shall be disposed of in the manner provide by law for the disposition of
unclaimed motor vehicles pursuant to 625 ILCS 5/1-100, et seq., as amended.



   (2)   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner of
record, lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take
possession of a motor vehicle impounded under this Section until the
administrative fee and towing and storage costs to the applicable tow company
imposed pursuant to this Section have been paid.  However, whenever a person
with a lien of record against an impounded motor vehicle has commenced
foreclosure proceedings, possession of the motor vehicle shall be given to
that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the Village the
amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required
to pay all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative fee, plus
the applicable towing and storage costs.



   (3)    Costs for towing and storage of a motor vehicle pursuant to
this Section shall be those approved by the Chief of Police for all tow
companies authorized to tow for the Police Department.



6-10-8:  APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS:



   This Section is in addition to and shall not replace or otherwise
abrogate any existing State or Federal laws or any ordinance that relates to
the seizure or impoundment of motor vehicles, and any fee provided for in
this Section shall be in addition to any and all penalties that may be
assessed or imposed by a court for any criminal charges.  This Section shall
not apply:  (1) if the motor vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the
time of the violation and the theft was reported to the appropriate police
authorities within twenty-four (24) hours after the theft was discovered; (2)
if the motor vehicle is operated as a common carrier as defined by applicable
law and the violation occurs without the knowledge of the person in control
of the motor vehicle; or (3) if the motor vehicle is subject to successful
forfeiture proceedings under 725 ILCS 150/1, et seq., as amended (Drug
Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act); 720 ILCS 5/36-1, et seq., as amended
(Seizure and Forfeiture of Vessels, Vehicles and Aircraft); or other

to commence operation in the Village.  Thereafter, prior to a person's
continued operation of such a licensable commercial activity or establishment
in a subsequent license year, said person shall file a renewal application
not later than December 31 prior to each subsequent license year.  In the
event such person fails to file said renewal application by January 15 of the

mandatory court appearance is required.  Delinquency may also result in
suspension and/or revocation of the right to conduct commercial activities
within the Village. No license shall be renewed unless and until the licensee
has paid all other outstanding fines and fees due the Village.



   Each license issued by the Village shall, in the absence of any
provision to the contrary, bear the signature of the Director of Development
Services Department or his designee for purposes of this Chapter.  All
licenses authorized to be issued and required to be procured shall be issued
by the Development Services Department.  Each license issued shall be dated
and shall state to whom it is issued, for what purpose, the location, if any,
at which such business is to be conducted and the date when the license is to
expire.



   The required fee for each license issued shall be collected in full at
the time the application for a license, or the renewal thereof, is filed with
the Development Services Department.  In no event shall any rebate or refund
be made of any license fee, or part thereof, by reason of the death of the
licensee or by any reason of nonuse of the license or discontinuance of the
operation of the commercial establishment.



   It shall be unlawful for any person (which refers to, for purposes of
this Chapter, any individual, partnership, corporation, entity which
conducts, engages in, maintains, operates, carries on or manages a business
or occupation within the Village of Orland Park, and also includes any
business, corporation or entity which rents out or leases any building or
portion of a building to another person) to conduct, engage in, maintain,
operate, carry on, or manage a business or occupation for which a license is
required by any provision of this Code, without a license first having been
procured for such business or occupation. Any person violating this section
shall be charged additional fees no less than $200.00 nor more than $750.00
for each offense, and every day such violation continues shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.



   In addition, all contractors at the time of application shall furnish
the Village a bond (compliance bond) in the amount of twenty thousand dollars
($20,000.00) secured by a surety company licensed in Illinois and which is

shall guarantee that the contractor will comply with all requirements of
applicable Village ordinances.

   Subsequent to receipt of an application for a license where ordinances
of the Village necessitate an inspection or investigation before the issuance
of such permit or license, the Development Services Department shall refer
such application to the proper officer or employee for making such
investigation.  The officer or employee charged with the duty of making the
investigation or inspection shall make a report thereon to the Development
Services Department - favorable or otherwise.



   The Director of the Development Services Department shall make or cause
to be made an inspection in connection with the care and handling of food and
all other matters relating to sanitary conditions, including but not limited

inspections relative to the construction and safety of buildings or other
structures.  All other investigations, except where otherwise provided,
shall be made by the Chief of Police or by some other officer or employee
designated by the Village Manager.

   If, after due consideration of the information contained in the
application, the Development Services Department determines the application
is satisfactory, he shall approve the application.  Thereupon the
Development Services Department shall notify the applicant and issue a
license as provided above.



   If, after due consideration of the information contained within the
application, the Development Services Department determines that matters
concerning the application are unsatisfactory, it shall disapprove the
application, indicating the reasons therefor.  Thereupon, the Development
Services Department shall notify the applicant that the application has not

year.



   The Development Services Department shall endeavor to notify each
annual licensee of the expiration of time of the license held by the licensee
at least thirty (30) days prior to such expiration date; provided, however,
that a failure to make such notification or the licensee's failure to receive
it, shall not exclude the licensee from the obligation to obtain a new
license or a renewal.



   Except as otherwise provided herein, each license may be renewed upon
proper application and payment of the required fee.  The requirements and
procedures for granting and issuing a license renewal shall be the same as

of a single location shall be evidenced by the fact that all buildings
containing the principal or accessory uses: 1) shall be connected or shall be
located on the same lot or parcel; 2) shall be operated and managed by the
same person or owner; and 3) shall be an establishment with the same

provisions of this Chapter require him to pay a higher or additional license
fee, he shall pay the additional license fee due to the change or increase,

connection with the suspension or revocation of a license as provided in this
Section, shall have the right of appeal to the Village Board of Trustees.

oath setting forth specifically the grounds for appeal.  The Board of
Trustees shall thereupon set the time and place for a hearing on such appeal

the dry cleaning machines to be located in said store, and in the case of an
original application for a store not theretofore legally in operation, the
application shall be accompanied by a set of plans and specifications showing
the manner in which such machines shall be installed, showing all plumbing
connections, electrical wire connections and provisions for ventilation, all
of which shall be in compliance with the Building Code and other applicable
ordinances of the Village.  In the case of an initial application, the
Village Comptroller shall submit the aforesaid plans and specifications to
the Director of Code Enforcement of the Village for his examination and
approval before the issuance of any license hereunder.



7-3-1-2:  INSTALLATION AND OPERATION:



   Every operator of a dry cleaning establishment shall maintain and 
operate the establishment so as to satisfy the following requirements:



      (1)   Installation:



         Machines shall not be installed in buildings used in whole
or in part as dwellings.



         A satisfactory means of preventing any leaking liquid from
escaping the enclosure or room in which the dry cleaning equipment is
installed shall be provided.  In order to accomplish this a method must be
provided for drainage or otherwise removing the solvent in the event of
leakage. Such drain shall be connected to an emergency solvent storage tank
of sufficient capacity to hold the maximum quantity of fluid contained in all
the machines.



         An interlock system shall be provided on each machine to
prevent the loading door from being opened during the normal cycle.  This
system may be either electrical and/or mechanical and so connected that in
the event of a power failure the machine fails safe.



         Exhaust ventilation stacks from the dry cleaning machines
shall not be located in proximity to combustion air intakes on gas or oil
fired equipment.



   In self-service establishments, the layout of each store shall be such
that only the front or customer side of the dry cleaning machines shall be
readily accessible to the customer area and that the maintenance portions of
the machines shall not be accessible from the customer area.



      (2)   Operation:



         In self-service establishments, an attendant shall be
present and on duty during all operational hours of each store.



         Only the solvent and supplies specified by the equipment
manufacturer shall be used; provided, however, that in no event shall a
flammable solvent be used in the dry cleaning machines.



         The solvent shall be stored in closed containers and
transferred from such containers in lines free of leaks or defects.  All
storage facilities for solvent external from the dry cleaning machines shall
meet the requirements of the Chief of the Fire Protection District.



         Filter residue and other residues containing solvent shall
be handled and disposed of so as not to create a nuisance.  A covered metal
container shall be used for temporary storage.



         The design of each dry cleaning machine shall be such that
in the normal course of operation no significant amount of solvent is
retained in the cleaned items upon completion of the dry cleaning cycle.



         In self-service establishments, customer service areas of
each store shall be provided with general dilution ventilation (exhaust air
flow rates) according to the following schedule:



 

Minimum Air Flow Rate
Number of Machines
 
Per Machine (C.F.M.)



1 - 3

 

250




4 - 8 

 

200




9 - 16

 

150




17 or more

 

100




 



         This exhaust ventilation shall be in continuous operation
during all operational hours of each store.



         Maintenance areas of each store shall be provided with
general dilution ventilation (exhaust air flow rates) according to the
following schedule:



 

Minimum Air Flow Rate
Number of Machines
 
Per Machine (C.F.M.)



1 - 3

 

350




4 - 8 

 

300




9 - 16

 

250




17 or more

 

200




 



         All exhaust ventilation equipment shall be in operation on
a continuous basis during the hours each store is open to the public.  The
fan wiring of the exhaust equipment shall be such that the dry cleaning
machines cannot be operated unless the fan system is in operation.



         Each dry cleaning machine shall be provided with an exhaust
system capable of maintaining a minimum of one hundred feet (100') per minute
face velocity through the loading door whenever the door is open, which
exhaust system shall be in operation during all times of operation of the dry
cleaning machine to which it is affixed.  The dual work connections from
this system shall be sealed by solder or tape and the discharge stack
extended above the roof line.



         A supply of make-up air equal to or greater than the total
volume of air exhausted from the store shall be provided for the purpose of
eliminating negative pressure conditions.



         All machinery and equipment shall be kept in good working
condition and installed and maintained so that the customers and employees of
said store and the public generally will neither have access to the
maintenance area nor to any unguarded moving parts of the machinery, except
that the customers shall have access to the operating controls of the dry
cleaning machines.



         The premises shall be kept in good repair and maintained in
a clean and sanitary condition.  For self-service establishments a step by
step instruction list shall be posted in a conspicuous place for customer use
near the dry cleaning machines.  All maintenance personnel shall be
instructed as to the proper procedures for the handling of solvents.



         Each store shall be well lighted during all of the hours of
operation.

Orland Park will provide the licensee with a new replacement fee emblem or
certificate which shall be immediately displayed per subsection 2(C) above.



   (E)   No license shall be issued to any applicant unless he or she

deficiencies corrected.  The Police Chief may impose reasonable restrictions
and conditions upon issuing a new authorization to an alarm user with respect

fine schedule located in Appendix B unless he releases the responding agency
from the scene at the time he is advised of the alarm by the responding
agency.

false panic/holdup alarm and will be assessed a fine according to the fine
schedule located in Appendix B for each offense of which such person shall be
convicted and also count as a false alarm under this section. 



(Ord. 4415, 9-15-08; Amd. Ord. 5224, 10-2-17)

   1.   All fees and fines shall be paid to the Village Clerk for

for false alarm incidents within thirty (30) days of final determination by
the Administrative Hearing Officer will be considered a violation of this
chapter and will cause the revocation of the alarm permit pursuant to Section
8-3-9-4.  Such revocation does not abrogate the responsibility to pay the
fines.



   2.   Any violation of any provision of this chapter for which
another penalty is not specifically provided shall result in a fine according
to the fine schedule located in Appendix B for each offense of which such
person shall be convicted and every day a violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.  In addition, any violation of the provisions
of this chapter may cause a revocation of an alarm permit granted, pursuant
to the procedure and provisions of Section 8-3-9-4.



   3.   Alarm users whose permits have been revoked for a violation of
this Chapter will pay reinstatement fee according to the fine schedule

period of eight hours (or such lesser period if the Chief of Police or
his/her designee determines that facilities are not available for continued
impoundment), then the animal shall be disposed of by delivery to a chartered

right of property in, or the keeping, housing, harboring, maintaining,
feeding, or caring for, or having custody of any animal or dog shall be
deemed prima facie evidence of ownership of any such animal or dog for the
purpose of enforcing this section.

report documenting the occurrence of the second nuisance activity in a sixty
(60) day period or the third nuisance activity in a three hundred sixty-five
(365) day period at or within a property and determines that the property has
become a chronic nuisance property pursuant to this Section, the Chief of
Police shall:



      1.   Notify the person in charge in writing that the property
has been determined to be a chronic nuisance property. The notice shall
contain the following information: the street address or legal description
sufficient for identification of the property; a statement that the Chief of
Police has determined the property to be chronic nuisance property with a
concise description of the nuisance activities leading to his/her findings;
and a demand that the person in charge respond within ten (10) days to the
Chief of Police and propose a course of action that the Chief of Police
agrees will abate the nuisance activities giving rise to the violation.



      2.   Service shall be made either personally or by certified
mail, postage pre- paid, return receipt requested, addressed to the person in
charge at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance
property, or such other place which is likely to give the person in charge
notice of the determination by the Chief of Police.



      3.   A copy of the notice shall be served on the owner at such
address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is
located, and/or the occupant, at the address of the property, if these
persons are different from the person in charge, and shall be made either
personally or by certified mail, postage pre-paid, return receipt requested.



      4.   A copy of the notice shall also be posted at the property
after ten (10) days has elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to
the person in charge if the person in charge has not subsequently contacted
the Chief of Police.



      5.   The failure of any person to receive notice that the
property may be a chronic nuisance property shall not invalidate or otherwise
affect the proceedings under this Section.



      6.   After the notification, but prior to the commencement of
legal proceedings by the Village pursuant to this Section, a person in charge
stipulates with the Chief of Police that the person in charge will pursue a
course of action the parties agree will abate the nuisance activities giving
rise to the violation, the chief of police may agree to postpone legal
proceedings for a period of not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30)
days. If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of the
nuisance activity or if no agreement concerning abatement is reached within
thirty (30) days, the Chief of Police shall request authorization from the
Village Manager or his/her designee for the Village Attorney to commence a
legal proceeding to abate the nuisance.



      7.   Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth
herein, the Chief of Police shall send copies of the notice, as well as any
other documentation which supports legal proceedings to the Village Attorney.



      8.   When a person in charge makes a response to the Chief of
Police as required above, any conduct or statements made in connection with
the furnishing of that response shall not constitute an admission that any
nuisance activities have or are occurring. This subsection does not require
the exclusion of any evidence which is otherwise admissible or offered for
any other purpose.



   D.   Abatement of nuisance. The Village Attorney may commence an
action to abate a public nuisance as described in this Section. Upon being
satisfied by affidavits or other sworn evidence that an alleged chronic
nuisance property exists, the court may without notice or bond enter a
temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction to enjoin any
defendant from maintaining such nuisance and may enter an order restraining
any defendant from removing or interfering with all property used in
connection with the public nuisance.



   E.   Burden of Proof.



      1.   In an action seeking closure of a chronic nuisance
property pursuant to this Section, the Village shall have the initial burden
of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic
nuisance property.



      2.   It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of
chronic nuisance property pursuant to this Section that the owner of the
property at the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable
care or diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic nuisance
property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and
diligence, control the conduct leading to the findings that the property is a
chronic nuisance property.



      3.   In establishing the amount of any civil penalty
requested, the court may consider any of the following factors and shall
state those found applicable: 



         a.   The actions or lack of action taken by the person
in charge to mitigate or correct the nuisance at the property.



         b.   Whether the nuisance at the property was repeated
or continuous.



         c.   The magnitude or gravity of the nuisance.



         d.   The cooperation of the person in charge with the
Village.



         e.   The cost of the Village investigating and
correcting or attempting to correct the nuisance condition.



   F.   Remedies.



      1.   In the event a court determines property to be a chronic
nuisance property under this Section, the court may order that the property
be closed and secured against all use and occupancy for a period of not less
than thirty (30) days, but not more than one hundred eighty (180) days or the
court may employ any other remedy deemed by it to be appropriate to abate the
nuisance.



      2.   In addition to the remedy provided in subsection (1)
above, the court may impose upon the owner of the property a civil penalty in
the amount of up to $500 per day, but no less than $100 per day, payable to
the Village, for each day the owner had actual knowledge that the property
was a chronic nuisance property and permitted the property to remain a
chronic nuisance property. 



      3.   In determining what remedy or remedies shall be employed,
the court may consider evidence of other conduct which has occurred on the
property, including, but not limited to:



         a.   The disturbance of neighbors.



         b.   The recurrence of loud and obnoxious noises. 



   G.   Emergency closing procedures.



      1.   In the event that it is determined that the property is
an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare, the Village may
apply to the court for such interim relief, as is deemed appropriate by the
Chief of Police. In such an event, the notification provision set forth in
Subsection (C) above need not be complied with, however, the Village shall
make a diligent effort to notify the person in charge prior to a court
hearing.



      2.   In the event that the court finds the property
constitutes a chronic nuisance property as defined in this Section, the court
may order the remedy set out above. In addition, in the event that it also
finds the person in charge had knowledge of activities or conditions of the
property constituting or violating this Section and permitted the activities
to occur, the court may assess a civil fine as provided above.



      3.   The court may authorize the Village to physically secure
the property against use or occupancy in the event the owner fails to do so
within the time specified by the court. In the event that the Village is
authorized to secure the property, all reasonable costs incurred by the
Village to affect a closure shall be made and assessed as a lien against the
property. If used herein, "costs" means these costs actually incurred by the
Village for the physical securing of the property.



      4.   The Village shall prepare a statement of cost and the
Village shall thereafter submit said statement to the court for its review.
If no objection of the statement is made within the period described by the
court, a lien in said amount may be recorded against said property.



      5.   Any person who is assessed the cost of closure and/or
civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof
to the Village.



   H.   If any provision, clause or paragraph of this Section shall be
held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not
affect the remaining provisions of this Section. 



   I.   Other remedies. The adoption of this Section does not preclude
the Village from using any other lawful methods to enforce the provisions of
this Code.

   2.   No person shall drive a vehicle upon 88th Avenue between 135th

speed greater than thirty five (35) miles per hour.  The fact that the speed
of a vehicle does not exceed thirty five (35) miles per hour shall not
relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and
crossing an intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when
approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway
or when a special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic
or by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speeds shall be decreased

of the street or highway, or endangers the safety of any person or property
or at a speed greater than forty (40) miles per hour.  The fact that the

approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway
or when a special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic
or by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speeds shall be decreased

all persons to use due care.



   5   No person shall drive a vehicle upon 151st Street from 82nd

or at a speed greater than forty five (45) miles per hour.  The fact that
the speed of a vehicle does not exceed forty five (45) miles per hour shall
not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and

approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway
or when a special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic
or by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speeds shall be decreased

per hour.  A lower speed shall be required if thirty (30) miles an hour is
greater than reasonable and proper with regard to the traffic conditions and
the use of the street or highway, or endangers the safety of any person or
property.  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed thirty (30)
miles per hour shall not relieve a driver from the duty to decrease speed
when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going
around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow
or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions;
and speeds shall be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any

A lower speed shall be required if forty-five (45) miles per hour is greater
than reasonable and proper with regard to the traffic conditions and the use
of the street or highway, or endangers the safety of any person or
property.  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed forty-five
(45) miles per hour shall not relieve a driver from the duty to decrease
speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and
going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any
narrow or winding roadway, or when a special hazard exists with respect to
pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions;

to the traffic conditions and the use of the street or highway, or endangers

by the Village.  Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police
officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of the

time of the alleged violation, of the fact of the seizure and of the vehicle

amount of $500.00 and pays the towing and storage charges.



9-11-10-4:  PRELIMINARY HEARING



   If the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this Section

hearing within twenty-four (24) hours of the seizure.  Said request shall be
in writing and filed with the Deputy Chief of Police or his designee who
shall, if the appeal is timely filed, conduct such preliminary hearing within
24 hours after receipt of the request excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or
Village holidays.  All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing.  The
formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence
shall be admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by
reasonably-prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs.  If, after the
hearing, the Deputy Chief of Police or his designee determines there is
probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and
impoundment pursuant to this Section, he shall order the continued
impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this Section, unless the owner of
the vehicle posts with the Village a cash bond in the amount of $500.00, and

the vehicle was seized.  All interested persons shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to be heard at the hearing.  At any time prior to the hearing
date, the hearing officer may, at the request of either party, direct
witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing.  The formal rules of
evidence will not apply at the hearing, and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible only if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably-prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs.  If, after the hearing, the Hearing
Officer determines by a preponderance of evidence that the vehicle was used
in connection with a violation set forth in this Section, the Hearing Officer
shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly
liable to the Village for an administrative penalty in an amount not to
exceed $500.00 and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until
the owner pays the administrative penalty to the Village plus fees to the
tower for the towing and storage of the vehicle.  If the owner of record
fails to appear at the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall enter a default
order in favor of the Village.  If the Hearing Officer finds that no such
violation occurred, the Hearing Officer shall order the immediate return of
the owner's vehicle or cash bond without fees.



9-11-10-6:  ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY.



   If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this Section, such
penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the Village.  If a cash
bond has been posted pursuant to this Section, the bond shall be applied to
the penalty.  If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty is
imposed, the Village may seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce
such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law.  Except as provided
otherwise in this Section, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the
penalty is paid to the Village and any applicable towing and storage fees are
paid to the tower, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to
the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle or the vehicle is
sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as
provided by law.  If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not
paid within 30 days after an administrative penalty is imposed against an
owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle
shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by
law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles.  In all other cases, if the
administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within 30 days after
the expiration of time at which administrative review of the Hearing
Officer's determination may be sought, or within 30 days after an action
seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the Village,
whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed
vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code.  (625 ILCS 5/4-208)



9-11-10-7:  VEHICLE POSSESSION



   1.   Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner,
lien holder, or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of
a vehicle impounded under this Section until the administrative penalty and
fees applicable under this Section have been paid.  However, whenever a
person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced
foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that
person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the Village the amount of
the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay
all lien holders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus
the applicable fees.

Secretary or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to
the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved
database or, under Section 11-1306 of the Code, to the lessee of the cited
vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the
time of the lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as
undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post

   A person owing an unpaid fine or penalty for Automated Traffic Law
Violation penalty may file a petition to set aside a final determination of
such liability within ten (10) days after service by the Village of a
Determination Notice.  Such a petition shall be filed by sending the same,
together with any documentation in support thereof, to the Administrator by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the
Administrator.  The grounds for such a petition shall be limited to: (a) the
person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date
the Violation Notice was issued, (b) the person having already paid the fine
or penalty for the violation in question, and (c) excusable failure to appear
at or request a new date for a hearing.  A hearing on such a petition shall
be held within thirty (30) days after the filing of same.  In the event that
such a petition is granted upon a showing of just cause, and the subject
determination of Automated Traffic Law Violation liability is thereby set
aside, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits
for that violation.



9-16-11:  SUSPENSION NOTICE:



   A Suspension Notice, shall be sent to the person liable for any fine or

date of deposit in the United States mail.



9-16-12:  CHALLENGE TO CERTIFIED REPORT:



   If the Administrator provides a Suspension Notice to a vehicle owner
and subsequently makes a Certified Report to the Secretary, the subject
vehicle owner may challenge the accuracy of the Certified Report in
writing.  To do so, the vehicle owner must submit to the Administrator a
written statement under oath, together with any supporting documentation,
establishing one of the following grounds for challenging the accuracy of the
Certified Report: (1) that the person was not the owner or lessee of the
subject vehicle or vehicles receiving five (5) or more Automated Traffic Law
Violations on the date or dates such Violation Notices were issued, or (2)
that the person already paid the fines or penalties for the five (5) or more
Automated Traffic Law Violations indicated on the Certified Report.  Such
statement and supporting documentation must be sent to the Administrator by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-delivered to the
Administrator within five (5) days after the person receives notice from the
Secretary that that the person's driver's license will be suspended at the
end of a specified period of time unless the Secretary is presented with a
notice from the Village certifying that the fines or penalties due and owing
have been paid or that the inclusion of the person's name on the Certified
Report was in error.



9-16-13:  NON-RESIDENT OF VILLAGE:



   Non-residents of the Village who receive Violation Notices may contest
the merits of the alleged Automated Traffic Law Violation without attending a
hearing by sending a signed statement, under oath, together with any
supporting documentation, to the Administrator via certified mail, return
receipt requested, within ten (10) days after service of the Violation
Notice.  Such a statement shall set forth the reasons why a finding of
liability should not be entered.  The Administrator shall rule on such a
statement within ten (10) days after receipt of same, and shall inform the
non-resident of his decision within ten (10) days thereafter. 



9-16-14:  PENALTY:



   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle cited for an Automated Traffic

the time of the violation, the owner of the motor vehicle is subject to a
penalty according to the fine schedule located in Appendix B for each offense
of which such person shall be convicted.

VILLAGE OF ORLAND PARK
LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE



Ordinance 2084 as Amended
Updated: September, 2018
Ordinance 5336



ARTICLE 1:
GENERAL PROVISIONS



SECTION 1-101.   TITLE.



   This ordinance shall be known as and referred to as the Land
Development Code of the Village of Orland Park.



SECTION 1-102.   PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.



   It is the purpose of the Land Development Code for the Village of
Orland Park to establish standards and regulations for review and approval of
all proposed development of property in the Village, and to provide a
development review process that will be comprehensive, consistent, and
efficient in the implementation of the Comprehensive Plan and other goals,
policies and standards of the Village.



   In order to foster and preserve the public health, safety, comfort and
welfare, and to aid in the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development
of the Village, it is the intent of the Board of Trustees that the
development process in the Village be efficient, in terms of time and
expense, effective, in terms of addressing the natural resource and public
facility implications of proposed development, and equitable, in terms of
consistency with established regulations and procedures, respect for the
rights of property owners, and consideration of the interest of the citizens
of the Village.



   It is the specific intent of the Village to work cooperatively with all
interested branches of government, including, but not limited to, the
Illinois Department of Transportation, the Illinois Department of Water
Resources, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and any local health
departments to aid in the harmonious, orderly and progressive development of
the Village.  It is also the intent of the Village to work cooperatively
with its neighboring county and township governments so as to foster the
integrated, comprehensive and equitable development of the Village and its
environs.



   These regulations are adopted pursuant to the authority granted to the
Village by Ill. Const. Art. VII, ?6 (1970) and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24,
?11-13-1 et seq. (1989) in order to carry out the purposes stated therein. 
Section 5-112, Subdivision Review Procedures, is adopted pursuant to the
authority granted to the Village by Ill. Const. Art. VII, sec. 6 (1970) and
Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, par. 11-12-5 et seq. (1989).



SECTION 1-103.   JURISDICTION AND APPLICABILITY.



   A.   General.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the
regulations in this Ordinance shall govern the development and use of land
and structures, including all lots of record, subdivisions and resubdivisions
of land and planned developments within the corporate limits of the Village
and to the extent permitted by law, within the extraterritorial jurisdiction
of the Village.  Except as otherwise provided by these regulations, no
building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and no building,
structure, or land shall be developed unless in conformity with all the
provisions of these regulations for the zoning district in which it is
located and all other applicable regulations.



   B.   Transition Period.  Where a complete application for
development approval (including building permit, special use approval, site
plan approval, variance approval, final plan or record plat approval) is
pending on the effective date of this Ordinance, the provisions of the
regulations in effect when the application was filed shall govern the review
and approval of the application for development approval.  If such
application is approved within six (6) months of the date of adoption of this
Ordinance, then the applicant shall be entitled to complete the development,
provided that construction begins within six (6) months of the issuance of
such approval and is diligently pursued to completion.



   C.   Existing Unlawful Uses and Structures.   A structure or use
not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations is
hereby deemed lawful as of the effective date of this Ordinance, provided
that it conforms with all of the requirements of these regulations. 
However, if such structure or use does not conform with all of the
requirements of these regulations, then such structure or use remains
unlawful hereunder.



   D.   Existing Permitted Uses.  When a lot is used lawfully on the
effective date of this Ordinance and Article 6 of these regulations
classifies such use as a "permitted use" in the zoning district in which it
is located, such use is hereby deemed to be a lawful permitted use for the
purposes of these regulations.



   E.   Existing Special Uses.  When a lot is used lawfully on the
effective date of this Ordinance and Article 6 of these regulations
classifies such use as a "special use" in the zoning district in which it is
located, such use is hereby deemed to be a lawful special use for the
purposes of these regulations.  If the use was approved as a special use
prior to the effective date of these regulations, and if the approval of such
special use was subject to one or more conditions, those conditions shall
continue in full force and effect unless a new special use approval is
obtained in accordance with Section 5-105 of these regulations.



   F.   Addition to, Expansion of, or Change of Use in Existing Special
Uses.   Any addition to or expansion of a lawful special use, as defined in
Subsection (E), above, shall require new special use approval in accordance
with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 5-105 of these
regulations for new special uses.  Any change in a lawful special use to a
new use shall be permitted only if these regulations classify the new use as
a permitted use or a special use in the zoning district in which it is
located, and only in accordance with the approval procedures set forth in
these regulations for such use.



   G.   Previously Granted Variances.  All variations granted prior to
the effective date of this Ordinance, and any conditions attached thereto,
shall remain in full force and effect, and the recipient of the variance may
proceed to develop the property in accordance with the plans previously
approved.  However, if the recipient of the variance has failed to act on
the variance before the variance expires, the provisions of these regulations
shall govern.



   H.   Prior Zoning Districts.  Upon the adoption of these
regulations, land which is presently zoned within an existing zoning
classification shall be classified within one of the zoning classifications
set forth in Article 6 of these regulations, as follows:



   Prior Zoning District      New Zoning District

SECTION 1-104.   REVIEW FEES.



   All applications for development approval submitted to the Village
under these regulations shall be accompanied by the payment of a fee as
determined by the Board of Trustees from time to time to defray the costs
incurred by the Village in reviewing the application.  In addition to the
fees set by the Board, all applicants for development approval shall
reimburse the Village for reasonable costs incurred as a result of the
application's review by a legal, engineering, landscape or other special
consultant, provided that the applicant is notified of the need to retain
such special consultant and agrees to such retention.  Payment of these fees
shall be paid in full by the Petitioner prior to issuance of a Certificate of
Occupancy, unless otherwise noted.  Payment of these fees shall still be
required to be paid in full by the Petitioner if or when a project is
withdrawn, denied or terminated, and shall be paid immediately upon the
Village notification to the Petitioner that said fees are due.

departments, divisions, agencies, organizations, groups, firms and residents
of the Village.  All administrative departments of the Village government,
as well as all agencies, boards and commissions shall provide to the
Director, upon his/her request, such available records or information as may

Village to implement said Plan.  The Development Services Department shall
prepare a written report setting forth the findings of such re-examination,
and shall transmit a copy thereof to the Plan Commission, the Board of
Trustees and the Village Manager.  These findings shall include:

   B.   Definition and Contents.



      1.   General Definition.  The CIP shall be consistent with
and shall implement the Comprehensive Plan.  The CIP shall be a program of
municipal capital improvement projects, with their estimated costs, projected
over a period of at least five (5) years.  The CIP shall include major
projects  currently being undertaken, or to be undertaken, with Federal,
State, County and other public funds or under Federal, State or County
supervision.  Such projects may include any major nonrecurring expenditure
or any expenditure for physical facilities of government, such as costs for
acquisition of land or interests in land; construction of buildings or other
structures, including additions or major alterations; construction of streets
and utility lines; improvements; acquisition of fixed equipment; installation
of landscaping; and similar expenditures.



      2.   Specific Contents.



         a.   A classification of the recommended projects based
on their urgency and need for realization.



         b.   A recommendation of a time sequence to be followed
in implementing the recommended projects.



         c.   The estimated cost and revenues, if any, of each
project, including estimates of probable operating and maintenance costs.

Village Manager or the Plan Commission may find useful or appropriate.



   C.   Purpose and Effect.



      1.   General Purpose.  The CIP shall serve as a means for
systematically reviewing proposed projects to ensure coordination of
expenditures and development with the Comprehensive Plan.  The CIP shall
link the timing, location and financing of proposed projects, shall encourage
the development of projects in scheduled stages, and shall provide developers
with an advance picture of future needs and development activities to be
undertaken by the Village.  The first year of the CIP shall, upon adoption
by the Board of Trustees, constitute the Capital Budget of the Village.



      2.   Effect.  Upon adoption, the CIP shall serve as notice of
the Village's capital needs and intentions for the five (5) year period.  No
other capital improvement shall be authorized except by prior amendment to
the CIP.



   D.   Procedures for Adoption and Amendment.



      1.   Program Development.  The Village Manager shall prepare
a proposed CIP and amendments thereto.



      2.   Adoption and Amendment.  Adoption and amendments to the
CIP shall require a public hearing before the Village Board of Trustees. 
The Village Board shall set, advertise and conduct a public hearing on the
plan, any element of the plan or any amendment to the plan in accordance with
the procedures in Section 5-101 (E); provided however, that the Board of
Trustees may add a public improvement to such CIP at any time if there is a
demonstrable need for such improvement and the funding for such improvement
is immediately available.



SECTION 4-103.   OVERLAY PLANS.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of an overlay plan is to set forth
development policies for discrete areas with special needs to guide Village
decisionmakers with respect to appropriate land use, subdivision, capital
improvement, service delivery and other public sector programming within the
geographical boundaries of the area encompassed by such plan.  Such plans
will permit the assembly of information at a more discrete level than is
possible in the Comprehensive Plan and will thereby provide decisionmakers
with more detailed information.



   B.   Scope of Plan.   An overlay plan may include the following
components:



      1.   geographical area of the neighborhood to be included in
the plan;



      2.   data on population, neighborhood attitudes, environmental
issues, zoning, type of land use and the location, traffic patterns, quality
and capacity of public facilities in the area;



      3.   existing, emerging and anticipated trends, problems, and
resources in the area relating to land use development and other activities
in the neighborhood;



      4.   a statement of the policies and objectives of the
community with respect to land use, quality of life and environment;



      5.   proposed development, land use and other changes
neighborhood residents wish to see implemented; and



      6.   the relationship between the CIP, Comprehensive Plan, and
other Village policies and the particular neighborhood.



   C.   Effect.  When an overlay plan has been approved by the Plan
Commission and adopted by the Board of Trustees, it shall be known as "The
Overlay Plan for                            ," and shall be an
element of the Comprehensive Plan and shall have the same effect as the
Comprehensive Plan as set forth in Section 4-101.



   D.   Adoption and Amendment.   Overlay plans shall be adopted and
amended in the same manner as provided for the Comprehensive Plan in Section
4-101.

Department. This section informs the public, the petitioner, the government
agent, and the elected and appointed officials of the procedures of the
Village of Orland Park for development review. It also simultaneously guides
them through the decision-making process and acts as a map for development
review in the Village of Orland Park.

acceptance by the Board of Trustees.



         e.   Final Engineering Review Process. The Development
Services Department shall review the engineering plans associated with the
application for development after approval or approval with conditions has
been granted by the Board of Trustees for the purpose of determining final

necessary Village permits and the plan to proceed toward implementation. 



            1.   If final engineering comments result in
substantial alterations to the Village Board approved final plan, the
petitioner/applicant shall return to the Plan Commission and restart the
development review process, republishing in the event of a petition requiring

continuance of a public meeting or a public hearing at which the applicant's
application is being considered, or who requests an extension of any time
limit imposed onto the applicant by statute or these regulations, shall be
deemed to have agreed to an extension of that time limit.



      2.   Successive Applications.



         a.   One Year Rule. Whenever any application for
development approval for a special use permit, variance, text and map
amendment to the Zoning Map (rezoning), subdivision, or preliminary plan is

   A.   General Requirement.  A development compliance approval shall
be required prior to the issuance of any building permit for any single
family residential development of six (6) or more units and for any
non-residential development.  (Ord. 3199 - 11/16/98; Amd. Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



   B.   Purpose.  The purpose of issuing development compliance
approvals is to ensure that any proposed development or modification of
existing development within the Village complies with these regulations and
any special provisions affecting a specific zoning district or development
activity.  (Ord. 3199 - 11/16/98)



   C.   Authority.  The Development Services Department is authorized
to certify that the proposed development of a single family home or the
construction of a fence or similar accessory structure complies with the
provisions of these regulations.  The Development Services Department is
authorized to certify that all other proposed development complies with the
provisions of these regulations.  (Ord. 3199 - 11/16/98; Amd. Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08)



   D.   Application.  An application for a development compliance

   E.   Procedures.



      1.   An application for a development compliance approval
shall be submitted to the Development Services Department.  Upon receipt of
an application for a development of compliance approval, the Development
Services Department or its authorized representative shall examine the
application.  If for any reason an application is completed improperly or
insufficiently, the t application shall be rejected, accompanied by a
notification of deficiencies and the rejected application shall be returned
to the applicant.  (Ord. 3199 - 11/16/98;  Amd. Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



      2.   If the Development Services Department determines that
the proposed development does not comply, the application shall be returned,
accompanied by a written statement setting forth the provisions of these
regulations with which the proposed development does not comply. (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08)



   F.   Effect of Issuance.   A development compliance approval letter
from the Development Services Department constitutes a basis for issuance of
a building permit if no other development approval is required.  (Ord. 3199
- 11/16/98; Amd. Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



SECTION 5-103.   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.



   A.   General Requirement.  No building or structure shall be
occupied or used until a certificate of occupancy is issued by the
Development Services Department after a determination that the building has
been constructed in accordance with the provisions of any special use permit,
plat approval, or building permit.  A temporary certificate of occupancy may
be issued in accordance with the provisions of this section.  (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08)



   B.   When Certificate Required.  A certificate of occupancy shall

after compliance with all provisions of these regulations has been
determined:  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



      1.   Occupancy and use of a building hereafter erected,

   C.   Procedure.



      1.   Application.  An application for a certificate of
occupancy or a temporary certificate of occupancy shall be filed in a form
prescribed by the Development Services Department.  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



      2.   Action on application.   The Development Services
Department, or their authorized representatives, shall inspect the property
that is the subject of an application for a certificate of occupancy or a
temporary certificate of occupancy to determine whether the use of the
property and the structures comply in all respects with the provisions of
these regulations and the Village Code, including the provisions of any
special use permit and to determine whether all construction debris is
removed from the site.  The Development Services Department need not inspect
a single family dwelling prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.  If the use and structure do not comply with these regulations or
other provision of the Village Code or with any Standard Construction
Specifications approved by the Village, the Development Services Department
shall deny the application in writing, setting forth the provisions of these
regulations or the Village Code with which the structure or use does not
comply unless he determines that a temporary certificate is warranted. 
(Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



      3.   Temporary Certificate of Occupancy.   A temporary
certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Development Services Department
provided that: (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



         a.   the applicant for such a temporary certificate
demonstrates that the construction which remains to be completed relates
solely to the external conditions of the development, such as landscaping,
and is not directly related to the safety of the premises; and



         b.   the applicant demonstrates that such completion is
impractical at the time the  temporary certificate is sought due to weather
or other conditions acceptable to the Development Services Department; and/or
is not directly related to the safety of the premises; and  (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08)



         c.   the applicant secures the completion of the
construction with a letter of credit, in a form acceptable to the Village
Manager and Village Attorney, and in an amount sufficient to complete the
construction, as determined by the Development Services Department.  (Ord.
4411 - 9/2/08)



         d.   The applicant is restoring an historic building or
is the occupant of the building and is doing the construction him or herself.



SECTION 5-104.   DEVELOPMENT PERMITTED AS OF RIGHT.



   A.   Purpose.  Development permitted as of right is that
development which is permitted in a zoning district provided developed in
conformity with these regulations.  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



   B.   Application.  An applicant for approval of development
permitted as of right shall submit an application for a building permit, and
an approved site plan if required by Sections 5-101 or  5-106, to the
Development Services Department.  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



   C.   Action on the Application.   If the Development Services
Department determines that the proposed development is in compliance with all
the requirements of these regulations, and the proposed development has
complied with all necessary and applicable review procedures of Section 5-101
and all other applicable regulations of the Village then a building permit
shall be issued with or without conditions. For applications regarding any
accessory structures, the Development Services Department must review the
permit application before the appropriate permit is issued.  (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08)



SECTION 5-105.   SPECIAL USE PERMITS.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of special use permits is to enable the
Village to approve those uses which are generally compatible with other land
uses permitted in a zoning district, but which require individual review of
their location, design and configuration and which may require the imposition
of conditions in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a
particular location.  The special use for a planned development is designed
to encourage flexible application of zoning regulations in order to promote
creative or imaginative design. (Ord. 3281  8/16/99)



   B.   Authority.  The Plan Commission may in accordance with the
procedures and standards of this Section recommend approval of special use
permits to the Board of Trustees.  (Ord. 4411  9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 5167 
2/20/17)



   C.   Authorized Special Uses.  Only those uses which are authorized
in Article 6, or in the zoning districts currently in effect, or those
nonconforming uses which are damaged or destroyed and are permitted to be
re-established in Section 8-101, may be approved as special uses.  The
designation of a use in a zoning district does not constitute an
authorization or an assurance that such use will be approved; rather, each
proposed special use shall be evaluated by the Plan Commission and Board of
Trustees for compliance with the standards and conditions set forth in this
Section and for each zoning district.  Wherever a use existing on the
effective date of these regulations is terminated or demolished, subsequent
use of the property upon which the use was located shall be permitted only as
a special use.  Whenever the property underlying a special use changes
ownership and the Development Services Department is notified of such change,
the Department shall determine whether the potential impacts of such new
ownership or other changed condition merit renewed special use review and
approval.  If the Development Services Department determines that the
impacts of the use will be significantly altered by virtue of the new
ownership, the Department shall notify the new owner that he or she must
initiate an application for a special use permit.  Conversely, if the
Development Services Department determines that the impacts of the land use
will not be significantly altered and that such other changed conditions will
not occur, no additional special use approval shall be required.  However,
such a determination shall not eliminate the need for the new owner to obtain
any other types of approvals or permits that may be required by these
regulations due to the change of ownership.  (Ord. 4411  9/2/08; Amd.
Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   D.   Initiation.  An application for a special use permit may be
submitted by the owner, an agent authorized in writing to act on the owner's
behalf, or other person having a written contractual interest in the parcel
of land proposed for development under a special use permit.



   E.   Standards Applicable to All Special Uses.   When considering
an application for a special use permit, the decision making body shall
consider the extent to which:



      1.   The special use will be consistent with the purposes,
goals, objectives and standards of the Comprehensive Plan, any adopted
overlay plan and these regula-tions;



      2.   The special use will be consistent with the community
character of the immediate vicinity of the parcel proposed for development;

   G.   Special Uses.



      1.   Applications.  An application for a special use permit,
including applications for all planned developments, shall be submitted to
the Development Services Department in a form provided by the Development
Services Department.  Applicants for special use permits for development of
1,000 acres or more must also apply for rezoning to the Large Scale Planned
Development District.  Petitions or applications for special uses must move
through the public hearing process as outlined in Section 5-101 of these
regulations.  (Ord. 2514  1/17/94; Amd. Ord. 4411  9/2/08; Amd. Ord.
5167  2/20/17)



   H.   Effect of Issuance of a Special Use Permit.   Issuance of a
permit for a special use shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use
for which it is issued.  Such permit shall not automatically expire upon the
transfer of the property to a subsequent owner.  Procedures should be
followed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-105 (C). (Ord. 2462 -
10/18/93)



   I.   Development Under an Approved Special Use Permit.



      1.   Development of the use shall not be carried out until the
applicant has secured and maintained active approvals of all other permits
and approvals required by these regulations, the Building Code,  the
Village, or regional, state and federal agencies and until the approved
special use is recorded in accordance with Section 5-105.H.  (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16)



   J.   Inspection During Development Under a Special Use Permit.



      1.   Following issuance of a special use permit, the
Development Services Department shall review on a quarterly basis until the
completion of the development, all permits issued and construction
undertaken, shall compare actual development with approved plans and permits
for development and the approved development schedule, if any, and shall
report his or her findings in writing to the Village Manager and the Plan
Commission.  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



      2.   If at any time during the construction of the development
approved by the special use permit, the Development Services Department
determines that development is not proceeding in accordance with the special
use permit as approved, then the Department may issue a stop work order and
immediately notify the Village Manager.  Within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of the stop work order, if the violation is not corrected, the Board
of Trustees shall schedule a meeting to consider the violation, conduct a
full investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged
violation, and either revoke the approved special use permit or amend the
special use permit in accordance with the provisions of Subsection  L or M
below.  (Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08)



   K.   Approval of Minor Deviations.  If the Development Services
Department finds that minor deviations from the approved plans and schedule
are necessary or desirable, the Department may approve the deviations and
amend the special use permit per the administrative Appearance Review process
(see Section 5-106).  Minor deviations shall be limited to the following: 
(Ord. 4411 - 9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16)



      1.   Reduction of the total amount of open space by not more
than five percent (5%) or reduction of the setback area or open space
associated with any single structure by not more than five percent (5%),
provided that such reduction does not permit the required open space to be
less than that required by Section 6-302;



      2.   Alteration of the location, type or quality of required
landscaping elements of the special use permit as long as the alteration does
not change the overall effect of the landscaping; and



      3.   Minor alterations in building siting and parking. (Ord.
5126 - 9/19/16)



   L.   Other Amendments or Adjustments.   Any other adjustments or
changes not specified in subsection N above shall be considered amendments to
the special use permit and shall be granted only in accordance with
procedures for original approval of a special use permit, as set forth in
this Section.



   M.   Inspections After Development.



      1.   Inspections by the Development Services Department.  
Following completion of the development of a special use, the Development
Services Department shall review the development for compliance with the use
as approved.  If it is determined that the special use has been developed in
accordance with the approval, then a Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued
in accordance with Section 5-103.  If the Development Services Department
finds that the development, as completed, fails in any respect to comply with
the use as approved, the Department shall immediately notify the applicant of
such fact.  The Development Services Department shall not issue a
Certificate of Occupancy pursuant to Section 5-103 until the Plan Commission
has acted on the Department's notification of non-compliance.  (Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16)



   N.   Termination of Special Use Permits.   If construction of a
special use permit has not been completed in accordance with the provisions
of Subsection J above, or the Plan Commission has determined that
construction has not been completed in accordance with the provisions of the
approved permit, the Board of Trustees shall conduct a public hearing in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5-101.  Upon the conclusion of the
public hearing, the Board of Trustees may terminate or modify the special use
permit.  In making such a decision, the Board shall consider whether there
are substantial and legitimate reasons why construction of the special use
was either not timely or in compliance with the original approval and whether
the termination of such permit will advance the goals and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan and the standards applicable to the original approval.
Unless extended pursuant to Section 5-105.I, special use permits shall expire
three years after the date of approval by the Board of Trustees if the
applicant has not started the approved work. Special use permits shall also
expire if they are not utilized for three years unless an extension is
granted by the Board of Trustees.  (Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00; Amd. Ord. 4411 -
9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



SECTION 5-106. APPEARANCE REVIEW.



   A.   Purpose.



      The Appearance Review process aims to maintain and enhance the
appearance of existing development throughout the Village, inclusive of
building and site changes, without necessitating the need for formal public
meetings. The general purpose of the Appearance Review process is to:



      1.   Authorize the Development Services Department to conduct
and approve minor site and exterior building changes;



      2.   Confirm conformance with requirements outlined in this
Code, in particular, but not limited to, Section 6-308 Design Standards;



      3.   Maintain harmony with the community character of the area
within which the development is located;



      4.   Discover improvements above and beyond minimum Code
requirements that will result in enhancements to the private and public
realms; and



      5.   Function as a backup documentation, if and as needed, for
the purpose of determining the distribution of any Village incentives, as
offered at the Villages discretion, such as the Appearance Improvement
Grant (AIG). (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)

Commission are hereby authorized to grant and/or recommend to the Board of
Trustees such variances from the literal terms of these regulations where
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships that may result
from strict compliance with these regulations so that the spirit of these
regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.  The Hearing Officer(s) shall hear those
applications affecting one (1) single family residential dwelling and those
applications affecting multi-family dwellings of fewer than six (6) units. 
All other applications for a variance shall be heard by the Plan
Commission.  (Ord. 3281 - 8/16/99; Amd. Ord.4411 - 9/2/08)



   B.   Application.  An application for a variance authorized under
the provisions of this Section shall be submitted to the Development Services
Department and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of Sections
5-101.  (Ord.4411 - 9/2/08)

stage.  If a final plan is not required, then variances shall be granted
prior to the issuance of a building permit.  (Ord. 3070-10/20/97)



   D.   Standards Applicable to all Variances.   The findings of the
Hearing Officer(s) or Plan Commission and the Board shall be based on data
submitted pertaining to each standard in this section as it relates to the
development.  A variance shall be granted only if the applicant
demonstrates:  (Ord.4411 - 9/2/08)



      1.   That the property in question cannot yield a reasonable
return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations governing the district in which it is located;



      2.   That the plight of the owner is due to unique
circumstances;



      3.   That the variation, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the locality;



      4.   That because of the particular physical surroundings,
shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out;



      5.   That the conditions upon which the petition for a
variation is are based are unique to the property for which the variance is
sought and are not applicable, generally, to other property;



      6.   That the alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by
these regulations and has not resulted from any act of the applicant or any
other person presently having an interest in the property subsequent to the
effective date hereof, whether or not in violation of any portion thereof;



      7.   That the granting of the variation will not be
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or
improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located or
otherwise be  inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan, any adopted overlay
plan or these regulations;



      8.   That the proposed variation will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the
congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger
the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within
the neighborhood;



      9.   That the variance granted is the minimum adjustment
necessary for the reasonable use of the land; and



      10.   That aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that
the strict application of the provisions of this Section would deprive the
applicant of any reasonable use of his or her land.  Mere loss in value
shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of all beneficial use
of land.



   E.   Limitations on Variances Granted by the Hearing Officer(s) or
the Plan Commission.   Variances may only be granted by the Hearing
Officer(s) or the Plan Commission in the below instances. The Village Board
of Trustees may also grant these and other variances to these regulations.

      3.   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise
prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots
but in no event shall the respective area and width of the lot or lots be
less than ninety percent (90%) of the required area and width.  The
percentage set forth in this subparagraph is not to be reduced by any other
percentage for minimum lot width and area set forth in these regulations.



      4   To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading
facilities required by not more than one (1) parking space or loading space,

the effective date of these regulations, is by reason of the exercise of the
right of eminent domain by any authorized governmental body or by reason of a
conveyance under threat of an eminent domain proceeding reduced in size so
that the remainder of said lot of record or zoning lot or structure on said
lot does not conform with one (1) or more of the regulations of the district
in which said lot of record or zoning lot or structure is located.



   F.   Review.  See Section 5-101 for public hearing procedures.

(Ord. 4940 - 11/3/14)



   F.   Landmarks Preservation, Rehabilitation, Restoration and
Incentives.



      1.   Preservation. The landmark designation works toward
preservation. The designation supports the action or process of protecting,
maintaining, and/ or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity
of a historic or architecturally significant place or an individual component
to a place or object, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can
include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the
place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage
so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and
minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.



         a.   United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for Preservation. In the case of preservation, the Land Development Code of
the Village of Orland Park refers to the United States Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Preservation for the preservation of landmarks. The
Standards follow below and may be used as a reference:  (Ord. 4940 - 11/3/14)



            1.   A property will be used as it was
historically, or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of
distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships. Where a
treatment and use have not been identified, a property will be protected and,
if necessary, stabilized until additional work may be undertaken.



            2.   The historic character of a property will be
retained and preserved. The replacement of intact or repairable historic
materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that
characterize a property will be avoided.



            3.   Each property will be recognized as a
physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize,
consolidate, and conserve existing historic materials and features will be
physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and
properly documented for future research.



            4.   Changes to a property that have acquired
historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.



            5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes,
and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
property will be preserved.



            6.   The existing condition of historic features
will be evaluated to determine the appropriate level of intervention needed.
Where the severity of deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of
a distinctive feature, the new material will match the old in composition,
design, color, and texture.



            7.   Chemical or physical treatments, if
appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments
that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.



            8.   Archeological resources will be protected and
preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
will be undertaken.



      2.   Rehabilitation. The landmark designation also works
toward rehabilitation. The designation supports the action or process of
making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic or
architecturally significant place or of an individual component to a place or
object, through repair, alterations and/ or additions, while protecting its
heritage value.



         a.   United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for Rehabilitation. In the case of rehabilitation, the Land Development Code
of the Village of Orland Park refers to the United States Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation for the rehabilitation of landmarks.
The Standards follow below and may be used as a reference:



            1.   A property will be used as it was
historically or be given a new use that requires minimal change to its
distinctive materials, features, spaces, and spatial relationships.



            2.   The historic character of a property will be
retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of
features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will
be avoided.



            3.   Each property will be recognized as a
physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false
sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or
elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken.



            4.   Changes to a property that have acquired
historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved.



            5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes,
and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
property will be preserved.



            6.   Deteriorated historic features will be
repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in
design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.



            7.   Chemical or physical treatments, if
appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments
that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.



            8.   Archeological resources will be protected and
preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
will be undertaken.



            9.   New additions, exterior alterations, or
related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and
spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic
materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the
integrity of the property and its environment.



            10.   New additions and adjacent or related new
construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the
future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.



      3.   Restoration. The landmark designation emphasizes and
works towards restoration as well. The designation supports the action or
process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a
historic or architecturally significant place or of an individual component
to a place or object, as it appeared at a particular period in its history,
while protecting its heritage value.



         a.   United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards
for Restoration. In the case of restoration the Land Development Code of the
Village of Orland Park refers to the United States Secretary of the
Interior's Standards for Restoration for the restoration of landmarks. The
Standards follow below and may be used as a reference:



            1.   A property will be used as it was
historically or be given a new use which reflects the property's restoration
period.



            2.   Materials and features from the restoration
period will be retained and preserved. The removal of materials or alteration
of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize the period
will not be undertaken.



            3.   Each property will be recognized as a
physical record of its time, place, and use. Work needed to stabilize,
consolidate and conserve materials and features from the restoration period
will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable upon close
inspection, and properly documented for future research.



            4.   Materials, features, spaces, and finishes
that characterize other historical periods will be documented prior to their
alteration or removal.



            5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes,
and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize
the restoration period will be preserved.



            6.   Deteriorated features from the restoration
period will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature
will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials.



            7.   Replacement of missing features from the
restoration period will be substantiated by documentary and physical
evidence. A false sense of history will not be created by adding conjectural
features, features from other properties, or by combining features that never
existed together historically.



            8.   Chemical or physical treatments, if
appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments
that cause damage to historic materials will not be used.



            9.   Archeological resources affected by a project
will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.



            10.   Designs that were never executed
historically will not be constructed.



      4.   Landmark Incentives. Local landmarks are capable of
participating in local, county, state or federal tax incentive programs or
grants that assist in the preservation, rehabilitation or restoration of
historically or architecturally significant buildings. Qualification for
these incentives is based primarily on the criteria set out by each
individual program's lead agency. Local designation is often the first
requisite. Sites, structures, buildings etc. must be included on the Local
Register of Significant Places as officially recognized local landmarks in
order to participate.



   G.   Landmark De-designation Review Procedure.



      1.   Landmark De-designation. Landmarks shall be de-designated
by the Development Services Department based on the review of changes made to
them during a Certificate of Appropriateness review at the Plan Commission.
The Development Services Department shall write a report and recommendation
to the Plan Commission to de-designate a landmark. The same review sequence
outlined in Section 5-101.C for designating landmarks shall apply for
de-designating them.  (Ord. 4940 - 11/3/14)



      2.   Removal from the Register. De-designated landmarks shall
be removed from the Local Register of Significant Places and shall not be
eligible for local, county, state, or federal tax incentive programs or
grants.



   H.   Natural Resource Conservation, Natural Heritage Sites, and
Scenic Corridors.



      1.   Natural Resource Conservation. Section 5-110 of these
regulations shall not be used to landmark, and thereby regulate, or act as a
means to conserve, the natural resources of the Village of Orland Park. This
section does not authorize landmark status to be placed on any natural
resource in the Village of Orland Park. In so far as this section is
concerned, natural resources are conserved via the sustainable preservation,
restoration, rehabilitation and reuse of existing sites, buildings,
structures etc. that have landmark status. Section 6-213 of these
regulations, titled "Open Lands District" protects and preserves the
Village's natural areas.



      2.   Natural Heritage Sites. The Development Services
Department may recommend to the Village Board of Trustees a resolution for
the non-binding designation of "Orland Park Natural Heritage Site" on the
natural resources of the Village that are historically important to the
Village and/ or are ecologically significant to the area for the habitat of
wildlife or for the perpetuation of the prairie or savannah character once
prevalent in the region.



         a.   Non-binding Designation. The non-binding
designation is meant to act as a means of qualitative description for natural
resources. Natural resources as dynamic symbiotic systems cannot be preserved
like a landmark building or site regarding materials, resources and
regulatory oversight. The non-binding status preserves the Village's ability
to dynamically deal with natural resources and systems in conservation
efforts commonly employed by park services, forestry officials, and
ecologists, while still highlighting the important role the site has in the
history and identity of the Village of Orland Park.



      3.   Orland Park Natural Heritage Sites. The following sites
are duly listed as part of Section 5-110 of the Village of Orland Park Land
Development Code. They are considered Natural Heritage Sites of the Village
of Orland Park and shall each individually be known as an "Orland Park
Natural Heritage Site".



         a.   Natural Heritage Sites.



            1.   "Humphrey Woods", 14500 S Ravinia Avenue;



      4.   Scenic Corridors. Section 6-404 of these regulations
authorizes the establishment of scenic corridor easements which shall serve
to protect and maintain a rural/suburban atmosphere in certain sections of
the Village and its one and one-half (1 ½) mile jurisdiction. Such corridor
easements will also provide a refuge for natural resources and wildlife and a
natural buffer between more-developed areas. Such corridor easements shall be
known as "Scenic Corridors" per these regulations and may be marked
accordingly. In the context of landmark designation, scenic corridors shall
act to promote the preservation of historic, natural or scenic qualities
along public roads and streets. Regulation for scenic corridors shall be
established on a case by case basis with regard to the terms of the easement
per Section 6-404.



SECTION 5-111.   CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   CHAPTER DELETED (Ord. 4210, 12/18/06)



   The content of this chapter was incorporated into new chapters for the
Village Center District (6-212) and the Old Orland Historic District
(6-209).

re-subdivisions, planned developments and development of land within the
corporate limits of the Village and within one and one-half (1 1/2) miles
beyond the corporate limits of the Village;



         b.   in the event another municipality's
extraterritorial jurisdiction overlaps the extraterritorial jurisdiction of
the Village and there is a boundary agreement between the Village and that
municipality, these subdivision regulations shall be applicable to the
territory as described in the agreement;



         c.   in the event another municipality's
extraterritorial jurisdiction overlaps the extraterritorial jurisdiction of

shall be applicable to the territory from the corporate limits of the Village
to a median line equidistant from its boundary and the boundary of the other
corporate authority nearest the Village at any given point on the land;



         d.   Not-with-standing the provisions of Subsection c,
above, if a development or subdivision is primarily located within a
neighboring municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction, and where only  a
small percentage of the development or subdivision would be affected by the
exercise of the Village's jurisdiction, the applicant would not be required
to obtain development or subdivision approval by the Village.  However, if
the Village Manager determines that a substantial benefit to the Village
would be achieved by such review, such as the review of significant drainage,
streets or other development or subdivision-related issues, then the
applicant shall be required to comply with the provisions of these
regulations.  The applicant may appeal the determination of the Village
Manager to the Board of Trustees; and  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)

extraterritorial jurisdiction may be developed, used, or occupied unless a
final plan has been approved in accordance with the terms of these
regulations.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08) 



      3.   These development and subdivision procedures shall not be
applicable to:



         a.   the sale or exchange of parcels of land between
owners of adjoining and contiguous land which does not involve any new
streets or easements of access or create an unlawful condition on the

   C.   General Procedures.



      1.   Development Review.  For all development review
procedures associated with the approval process refer to Section 5-101 of
these regulations.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08) 



   D.   Record Plat of Subdivision Procedure.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of the record plat of subdivision
review is to determine whether the record plat, and required subsequent plats
as a result of the subdivision, are in substantial conformance with the
approved final plan. This procedure shall include but not be limited to plats
of vacation, dedication, easement, abrogation and consolidation.  (Ord. 4412
- 9/2/08) 



      2.   Initiation.  An application for record plat of
subdivision review may be submitted by the owner, an agent authorized in
writing to act on the owner's behalf, or other person having a written
contractual interest in the parcel of land proposed for subdivision.
Topographical and profile studies must be submitted prior to plat approval. 
Park land shall be deeded to the Village prior to plat approval.  All
conditions of Village Board plan approval must be addressed and security
provided for landscaping prior to plat approval. (Ord. 3070-10/20/9; Amd.
Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      3.   Review and Recommendation by the Development Services
Department.   After a final plan has been approved by the Board of Trustees,
the petitioner shall prepare and submit an application and a record plat of
subdivision on mylar or vellum to the Development Services Department.  Said
Department shall certify that the record plat conforms to the approved final
plan.  A recommendation will then be forwarded to the Board of Trustees. 
(Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02; Amd. Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      4.   Board Action. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the
Development Services Department staff on a record plat, the Board of Trustees
shall review the application and approve, continue with conditions, or
disapprove the record plat pursuant to Section 5-101.B.3.c. The Village
President, the Village Clerk, and the Village Comptroller shall sign the
approved record plat.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02; Amd. Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      5.   Recording of Plat.   All record plats shall be recorded
by the Village with the Recorder of Deeds or Registrar of Titles in the
County in which the land is located. 



   All record plats shall be recorded at a time specified by the
developer, within one (1) year of approval of the final plan by the
Village.  No record plat shall be recorded until the developer has withdrawn
the property from registration in Torrens pursuant to the procedures required
by law, has satisfactorily complied with the provisions of Subsection E,
below, regarding guarantees of improvements, has paid the fee of the Recorder
or Registrar of Titles, and has paid any other applicable fees.



         a.   Plats should include the required school district
statement within the owner's certificate;



         b.   Plats should include the authorization statement
from surveyor authorizing the representative of the Village of Orland Park to

   E.   Guarantees for Improvement Completion



      1.   General.  In order to assure that growth in the Village
will be orderly and to guarantee the completion of public or private
improvements required by these regulations after final approval, no final
engineering and no building permits shall be approved/issued, and no
installation or construction of such improvements shall commence until the
requirements of this Section have been met.  This Section shall also apply
to development within the Village's one and one-half (1 1/2) mile
extraterritorial jurisdiction unless the Village obtains written
documentation from the developer that he or she has provided the other
applicable governmental unit with a performance guarantee, insuring the
completion of such improvements.  The provision of any performance guarantee
does not in any way relieve the developer and/or owner from the obligation to
complete all private or public improvements related to the development. 
(Ord.2746 - 6/5/95; Amd. Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      2.   Performance Guarantee.  A performance guarantee
acceptable to the Village must be provided in accordance with the provisions
of this Section and shall constitute part of the final approval required by
the Board of Trustees.  The guarantee shall constitute an agreement signed
by the applicant and the Village Manager, and approved by the Village
Attorney, that guarantees the completion of all required improvements within
a specified time.  The agreement shall indicate the title and date of the
final engineering plans reviewed by the designee of the Development Services
Department, for the purpose of establishing the guarantee amount, and that
security as provided in this section, equal  to 125% of the total projected
costs of public improvements. This shall be submitted to the Village. (Ord.
3070 - 10/20/97; Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      3.   Security Methods.  One of the following security methods
shall be utilized to guarantee the comple-tion of public improvements:



         a.   Letter of Credit



            1.   Form:  The applicant may file an irrevocable
letter of credit issued by any local financial institution approved by the
Village Manager and the Village Attorney, in accordance with guidelines
established by the Board of Trustees.  The letter of credit shall be in the
same written form as the sample letter of credit that is provided by the
Finance Department.



            2.   Terms:  The letter of credit shall be in an
amount sufficient to pay for the cost of construction of the public
improvements, landscaping on private and public property for single family
and multi-family residential developments and all non-residential
developments, and all engineering costs if deemed necessary by the Village
Engineer.  The Village will collect an additional 7% of the total cost of
construction to recover for management and administrative time and expenses
incurred by the Village staff in processing and administering the public
improvements and landscaping. Any conditions that the applicant or issuing
financial institution seeks to attach to collection or use of the funds, must
be included in the terms of the letter of credit. The letter of credit shall
provide that the issuing financial institution shall pay to the Village, or
as the Village directs, such amounts as may be required to complete the
improvements according to the approved specifications.  The letter of credit
should provide that its amount will be reduced from time to time as payments
for improvements approved by the Village Engineer are made, but at no time
shall the available balance be less than fifteen percent (15%) of the total
estimated cost of the improvements yet to be accepted by the Village.  (Ord.
4125  4/17/06)



            3.   Time Limit:  The letter of credit shall be
irrevocable for at least twelve (12) months and shall have an expiration date
of not less than sixty (60) days after the date of completion specified for
the improvements. The letter of credit shall automatically be extended for
additional periods of one (1) year unless the Village notifies the applicant
at least thirty (30) days in advance of the expiration date that the Village
will not accept an extension of the letter of credit.  If any balance
remains at the expiration of any time limit placed on the letter of credit,
the applicant shall be notified that the current letter of credit must be
renewed or that said balance must either be deposited with the Village in a
cash escrow, or a new letter of credit must be provided.



(Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



         b.   Other Guarantee Security Method.  The Board of
Trustees may, at its discretion, approve any other security method. 



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      4.   Insufficient Fund Balance.  If, at any time before the
construction of all required improvements has been completed, the balance of
funds remaining undisbursed under any guarantee provided in accordance with
this section is not sufficient, in the judgment of the Village Engineer, to
cover the costs of construction of said improvements and all engineering
costs (including the engineering and inspection fees of the Village) or if by
reason of any order, decree or writ of any court, or for any other reason,
the said undisbursed balance of funds shall be withheld, diminished or
otherwise unavailable for the purposes provided herein, the applicant agrees
to cause the balance to be increased to such amount as shall be required by
the Village for such purposes, in the exercise of its judgment, or shall
provide such other guarantee of performance as may be required by the
Village.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      5.   Time Limit.  All performance guarantees shall provide
that if the required improvements are not installed within two (2) years of
approval of the final plan, or a period of time otherwise specified by the
Village, or in an applicable agreement between the Village and developer, the
Village may deem the applicant to be in default, and may proceed in
accordance with Section 6 below.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      6.   Default.  In the event the Village Engineer determines,
in the exercise of his judgment, that the applicant has failed to install
proposed improvements in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications, or has failed to comply with the terms of the guarantees
provided in this Section, the Board of Trustees may take any of the following
actions:



         a.   Disbursement of Letter of Credit.  The Board of
Trustees may advise the  applicant in writing of the failure to install
improvements, and give the applicant thirty (30) days to cure such failure. 
If the applicant fails to cure said failure, the Village may, at its option,
declare the applicant in default, and all monies on deposit pursuant to the 
letter of credit shall be disbursed by the letter of credit provider upon
authorization of the Village Engineer. 



         b.   Disbursement of Other Security Guarantees. The
Board of Trustees may advise the applicant in writing of the failure to
install improvements, and give the applicant thirty (30) days to cure such
failure. If the applicant fails to cure said failure, the Village may, at its
option, declare the applicant in default, and all monies on deposit pursuant
to the specified security guarantee shall be disbursed by the guarantee
provider upon authorization of the Village Engineer.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      7.   Guarantee Amount.  The amount of the performance
guarantee shall cover all construction costs.  The guarantee shall be in the
following minimum amounts unless the applicant can show that certain of the
costs have already been paid or construction has been satisfactorily
completed. 



      Construction Cost:



         a.   One hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the
estimated construction cost of all public improvements, including public
improvements on private property, as approved and designated by the Village
Engineer;



            1.   Note: The provisions of 8.a.3.a below plus
the provisions of 8.a.3.b below equal to the above mentioned provision in 7.a



         b.   Plus one-hundred percent (100%) of the estimated
cost of landscaping on private and public property. In single family detached
developments, private foundation landscaping and lawn seeding are not
included in the letter of credit.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08; Amd. Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



      8.   Reduction in Amount of Guarantee.



         a.   The applicant may from time to time as the public
improvements are constructed, request a reduction in the amount of guarantee
furnished. Said request shall be made by the applicant to the Public Works
Department by filing the below documents.  The Village Manager's Office
shall provide final approval of the request for a reduction in the amount
guarantee furnished.



            1.   A request for reduction indicating the
requested amount;



            2.   A new or substitute letter of credit, or
other approved security method for the reduced amount, if required (to be
filed within seven (7) days after the approval of the reduction); 



            3.   An estimate by the applicant's engineer
containing the following information:



               a.   The estimated cost of construction of
the public improvements then not completed (less sidewalks on buildable lots);



               b.   The cost of contingencies and
escalation of the cost of public improvements shall increase the above
estimated amount by twenty-five percent (25%); 



               c.   Fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of
construction of the improvements constructed and in place shall remain in the
letter of credit; and



               d.   Twenty-five percent (25%) of the
estimated cost of  sidewalks on buildable lots, not to be reduced until  at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the sidewalks are completed. 



            4.   Evidence acceptable to the Village Attorney
that the cost of the public improvements is either paid or otherwise
adequately provided for.



         b.   The Village Engineer shall submit the above
documents in writing to the Public Works Department, with the exception of
those documents provided in accordance with Subsection 5-112.E.3.a of this
Section.  The Public Works Department shall recommend to the Village
Manager's Office approval or disapproval of said request. No reduction in the
guarantee furnished shall be granted which would reduce said guarantee below
a sum which is referenced in 5-112.E.8.a.3. 



         c.   In the event the reduction in amount of guarantee
is approved by the Village Manager's Office for a letter of credit, such
approval shall not become effective unless a new or substitute letter of
credit is received by the Village within seven (7) days after such approval.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      9.   Inspection and Certification of Improvements.



         a.   General.  Unless otherwise specifically provided,
inspection of the construction of the improvements shall be by the Village
Engineer or Village Consultant, and shall be paid for by the applicant should
the Village require compensation for its efforts.  No improvements shall be
constructed, and therefore no improvements shall be inspected, prior to final
plan approval. 



         b.   Certification.  Upon completion of all required
construction, the applicant's engineer shall certify that the improvements
comply in all respects with the plans and specifications approved by the
Board of Trustees.  All work shall at all times be subject to inspection by
the Village Manager, the Village Engineer, other Village officials, and their
representatives.  Regardless of contracts, agreements, or inspections
performed, the final responsibility for the construction of all improvements
in accordance with the applicable standards rests with the applicant. 
Certification by the applicant's engineer shall not constitute a waiver by
the Village of the right to draw funds under the security provided herein on
account of defects in or failure of any improvement that is detected or which
occurs following such certification.



         c.   Notice of Defects.   The Village Engineer shall
provide timely notice to the  developer whenever inspection reveals that an
improvement does not  conform to the 1 standards and specifications required
by these regulations. The developer shall have thirty (30) days from the
issuance of such notice to cure or to substantially cure such defect.  The
Village may not declare a default during the thirty (30) day cure period on
account of any such defect  unless it is clear that the developer does not
intend to cure the defect. 



         d.   Exemptions.  Because neighboring jurisdictions and
other utility districts are responsible for inspecting construction sites
within their territorial limits, and because the Village desires to avoid
duplicating the inspection of these projects, the Village shall only inspect
development located within its corporate limits.  The Village shall be
entitled to rely on the written inspection reports submitted by the engineers
of such neighboring jurisdictions and utility districts.  The Village
Engineer shall be entitled to verify any inspection report received from a
neighboring jurisdiction or utility district, and shall be given access to
the construction site to conduct such independent analyses.



         e.   Engineering Plan Review and Inspection Fee.



            1.   Engineering Plan Review. The plans and
specifications for all public and private improvements that shall be made
under the provisions of these regulations shall be submitted to the Village
Development Services Department for inspection and review.  As compensation
for Village staff plan review, a fee, if determined by ordinance of the
Village Board of Trustees, shall be paid to the Village at the time the plans
and specifications are finally approved by the Village.  In addition,
compensation for plan review by an engineering consultant for the Village
shall be equal to the amount charged to the Village by the consultant and
shall be paid by the applicant to the Village prior to the issuance of
building permits.



               a.   Compensation for engineering plan
review by Village staff shall be set by ordinance of the Village Board, and
shall be paid by the applicant to the Village at the time of final
engineering approval and before a building permit is issued. The compensation
levels may be amended from time to time. For an updated schedule contact the
Development Services Department. (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)   



            2.   Engineering Inspections. All public and
private improvements located within the Village's corporate limits that are
guaranteed under the provisions of this Section shall be inspected during the
course of construction by the Village Engineer, the Village's Engineering
Consultant, or their designee.  As compensation for such inspection by
Village staff, a fee if determined by ordinance of the Village Board of
Trustees shall be paid to the Village at the time the final engineering plans
are approved by the Village Engineer. In addition, compensation for
engineering inspection by an engineering consultant for the Village shall be
equal to the amount charged to the Village by the consultant and shall be
paid by the applicant to the Village prior to the issuance of building
permits.



               a.   Compensation for engineering
inspections by Village staff shall be set by ordinance of the Village Board,
and shall be paid by the applicant to the Village. The compensation levels

            3.   Landscape Plan Review and Inspections. All
preliminary landscape plans submitted to the Village in conjunction with
single family and multifamily developments over two (2) units and with all
non-residential developments, or for any other required landscape plans as
detailed in Section 6-305 Landscape and Tree Preservation, shall be reviewed
by the Plan Commission, Committee and Board of Trustees before Village
approval. All final landscape plans shall incorporate conditions of approval
of the Board approved preliminary landscape plan, and shall be reviewed and
receive final approval from the Development Services Department upon
recommendation of approval by the Village landscape consultant, if applicable.



            Upon installation of required landscaping, the
developer or property owner shall contact the Development Services Department
to schedule a landscape inspection, which will initiate the landscape
inspection process. All landscaping shall be inspected for proper
installation and compliance with the approved landscape plan and any
associated documentation, including hydro-period analyses or M&M Plans. A
minimum of three (3) years of consecutive naturalized landscape area
inspection approvals shall be attained before Village approval and acceptance
of any stormwater management area. A minimum of one (1) year of site
landscape approvals shall be attained before a letter of credit reduction can
be requested. No letter of credit release shall be issued until a final
landscape inspection approval has been granted by the Development Services
Department. The fees charged to the Village by its landscaping consultant for
landscape plan review shall be paid by the petitioner to the Village at the
time of petition. Fees charged to the Village by its landscaping consultant
for inspections of installed landscaping shall be paid by the petitioner to
the Village by the applicant before final letter of credit release.  (Ord.

         c.   Conditions of Guarantee.   The guarantee required
by this Section shall include five percent (5%) of the final construction
costs of the improvements in order to guarantee the cost of replacement of
any defective materials used in the construction of the improvements.  Said
amount shall remain in force for the aforesaid two (2) year maintenance
period and shall be for use by the Village to effect such repairs deemed
necessary for public safety and which the applicant has neglected to repair
for a forty-eight (48) hour period after notification.



         d.   Disbursements of Account.   Disbursements from the

(where appropriate) for the closing: 



         a.   A bill of sale for the personal property to become
public property located within the subdivision;



         b.   An assignment to the Village of the applicant's
rights and interests and warranties with respect to said personal property in
the subdivision;



         c.   A quit claim deed for all mains, valve  boxes,
streets, etc. for the public improvements located in the subdivision;



         d.   UCC searches with respect to the public personal
property located in the subdivision;



         e.   Judgment searches for the applicant;



         f.   Federal tax lien searches with respect to the
development/ subdivision and the applicant;



         g.   A certificate from the applicant's engineer that
the improvements are constructed in accordance with the approved engineering
drawings or an explanation and certification as to any deviations;



         h.   A certificate from the  applicant's attorney that
the appropriate corporate action has been taken by the applicant to make the
conveyances through the bill of sale, quit claim deed or other documents; and



         i.   Disclosure of beneficial interest in any land
trusts.



   The Village's acceptance of dedication shall be expressly conditioned
on the presentation by the applicant of a policy of title insurance for the
benefit of the Village showing that the applicant owns the improvement in fee
simple and that there are no liens, encumbrances, or other restrictions on
the improvement unacceptable to the Village Attorney in his reasonable
judgment.  Acceptance of dedication of any improvement shall not constitute
a waiver by the Village of the right to draw funds under the security
provided herein on account of any defect in or failure of the improvement
that is dedicated or which occurs after the acceptance of the dedication.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      3.   Resolution.  Upon receipt of the Village Manager's
Office letter of acceptance and the approval of the Village Attorney of the
improvements through the turnover proceedings identified in Section
5-112.F.2, above, the Board of Trustees shall adopt a resolution stating that
the Village accepts the improvements. (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



   G..   Private Improvements.



      1.   Privately Owned Improvements. Applicants constructing
privately owned improvements, including landscaping, ponds, bike and walking
paths, and private streets, shall demonstrate that adequate provision has
been made for the maintenance of such improvements.  Developers may create
either a homeowners association or a reciprocal easement relationship as a
means of demonstrating such provision.



      2.   Homeowners Association Agreements. The declaration of
covenants establishing a homeowners' association shall provide for the
maintenance of all common areas located within the development.  The
declaration shall further provide that if the common areas are not properly
maintained, the Village shall have the right to perform or cause to be
performed such maintenance, at the cost of the association or the owners of
property within the development, as applicable.  If the homeowners'
association or owners, as applicable, should fail to pay such cost upon
demand, the Village shall have the same rights as the homeowners' association
to  assess and  to collect the costs of such maintenance and to enforce in
its name and the name of the association, as applicable, all liens for such
costs granted to the association.



      3.   Easements.  If no homeowner's association is created,
the applicant shall create a reciprocal easement relationship between and
among all the properties in the development which makes adequate provision
for the maintenance of all common areas in the development.  The easement
documents shall provide a mechanism for:



         a.   sharing the costs of such maintenance on an
equitable basis among the owners of all lots in the development;



         b.   creating a lien on any owner's lot and for personal
liability of such owner if such owner shall fail to pay such owner's share of
such maintenance costs; and



         c.   enforcing such liens.



      4.   Maintenance Failure. If the lot owners fail to perform
such maintenance as may be reasonably necessary, the Village shall have the
right to perform or cause to be performed such maintenance as the Village
deems necessary, and in such event, may avail itself of the mechanism to
collect the costs of such maintenance from the owners.



         a.   The approval of a homeowners' association
declaration or a reciprocal easement relationship by the homeowners shall not
constitute an acceptance by the Village of such provisions for the
maintenance of the private improvements.  All such documents are subject to
the prior approval of the Village Attorney, which approval shall be obtained
by the applicant before an application for final plat approval is submitted
to the Board of Trustees.



   H.   Development and Subdivision Exactions: Dedication of Land and
Fees In Lieu of Dedication.



      1.   Purpose. In order to serve the educational, recreational
and transportation needs of new residents, applicants are required to either
donate land or cash or make improvements to the Village's parks, schools,
library system and transportation facilities as a condition of development or
subdivision approval.  (Ord. 2539  3/21/94; Amd. Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      2.   Park Exactions.



         a.   General Requirements.  The amount of park
facilities for new residents is partly based on data and policy in the
Village's Comprehensive Plan, which recommends a ratio of ten (10) acres of
active parks per 1,000 residents.  Of the ten (10) acres, five (5) acres are
designated for neighborhood parks, and five (5) acres are designated for
community parks. The capital improvement cost of Village parks averaged
$90,000 per acre in 1996.  The fee schedule is $45,000 per acre in 1996,
$67,500 in 1997, and $90,000 in 1998. Because neighborhood parks are intended
to contain facilities for immediately surrounding residents, and because the
need for new neighborhood parks is generated by new residents, new housing
development is being required by these regulations to pay 100% of land and
capital costs.  It is presumed that other revenues will pay for maintenance
and services in the new neighborhood parks. Because community parks serve all
residents, new housing development is only being required by these
regulations to pay forty percent (40%) of land and capital costs.  It is
presumed that other revenues will pay for sixty percent (60%) of land and
capital costs and one hundred percent (100%) of maintenance and service costs
of community parks.  Park exaction fees apply to all new residential
developments of two or more units.  (Ord.2860 - 3/18/96; Amd. Ord. 4412 -
9/2/08)



         b.   Fair Share Donation Formula.



            1.   Land Ratio.  Applicants for approval for
residential developments shall donate land to the Village at a ratio of seven
(7) acres per 1,000 people anticipated to ultimately reside in that
development.



            2.   Cash Ratio.  Applicants for approval for
residential developments shall also donate cash to the Village equal to the
capital improvement cost of seven (7) acres of park land for every 1,000
people anticipated to ultimately reside in that development per Table
5-112(H)(9).  The capital improvement cost per acre of park land shall be
determined by the Village based on empirical study of existing Village parks
and updated periodically.



            3.   Projected Population.  The ultimate
population of a development shall be projected using Table 5-112(H)(9).  If
an applicant does not commit to a unit mix in the application for development
approval, the Village shall assume that all detached single family units will
be four bedroom, all attached single family units will be three bedroom, and
all apartment/condominium units will be two bedrooms.  The Board of Trustees
may amend these regulations and Table 5-112(H)(9) as new data becomes
available on family size in the Village.



            4.   Location.  Land donated for new parks shall
be located based generally on the Village's Comprehensive Plan and official
map and shall specifically consider the design of each development.  The
amount of land required shall not include wetlands, flood plain or detention
facilities.



         c.   Park Donation Substitutions.  If park land would
be more appropriately located off-site, the Board of Trustees may agree to
accept cash in lieu of land from an applicant for residential development. 
The amount of land required from an applicant for residential development may
be reduced depending on the amount of the improved land, up to two (2) acres
established in a private park by the applicant, provided that such land is
determined to be of equivalent value and available by right to all residents
of the development. The applicant shall present evidence that the private
facility shall be equally available to all residents of the development. 



(Ord. 4412 -9/2/08)



      3.   School Exactions.



         a.   Requirement and Population Ratio.   The ultimate
number of students to be generated by a development shall directly relate to
the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites.  The land
dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: (1)
estimated children to be served in each school classification over (2) the
maximum recommended number of students to be served in such school
classification as stated herein and then applying such ratio to (3) the
minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school
classification.  The product of this calculation shall be the number of
acres of land the applicant must provide in order for the Village to have
sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increase of children
in each such school classification.



(Ord. 4412 -9/2/08)



         b.   School Classification and Size of School Site.
School classifications and size of school sites within the Village and its
planning jurisdiction shall be determined in accordance with the following
criteria: (Ord. 2539 - 3/21/94)                     



 

School Classifications by Grades
 
Maximum Number of Students for each such School Classifications
 
Minimum Number of Acres of and for each School Site of Such Classifications


Elementary Schools- Grades K-5
 
600 Students
 
12 Acres


Junior High Schools Grades 6-8
 
700 Students
 
19.5 Acres


High School Grades 9-12
 
2,500 Students
(Ord. 4183 - 9/18/06)
 
66 Acres
(Ord. 2539 - 3/21/94)



 



         c.   Location.  The Village's Comprehensive Plan shall
be used as the criteria in locating school sites.  If the Comprehensive Plan
fails to provide the necessary designation for the location of particular
school sites, then such designation shall be provided by the Village in
cooperation with the affected school district.  Such information shall be
made available to a subdivider within thirty (30) days of the request for
such information.



         d.   School Access.  All land dedicated for school
sites shall have vehicular access to public streets from two (2) separate
points, as approved by the Board of Trustees.



      4.   Combining Lands.



         a.   Whenever possible, and whenever in the best
interests of the Village and the affected school district, land dedicated for
park and recreation sites shall be contiguous to land dedicated for a school
site.



         b.   Where the development is less than forty (40)
acres, park and recreation land or school sites which are to be dedicated
should, where possible, and in the best interests of the Village and affected
school districts, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in
order to produce usable park and recreation lands or school sites and thereby
minimize hardship on a particular applicant.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      5.   Criteria for Requiring a Contribution of Cash in Lieu of
Park and Recreation Land and School Sites.



         a.   General.  Where the development is small and the
resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the available land is
inappropriate for park and recreation land use or for a school site, or when
land for park and recreation use cannot be made contiguous to land dedication
for a school site, the Board of Trustees, upon recommendation of the affected
school district and using the standards provided in this Section as a guide,
shall determine whether the applicant shall be required to pay a cash
contribution in lieu of the required land dedication. 



         b.   School and Park Accounting Trusts and Use of Fees.



            1.   The cash contributions in lieu of land for
park and recreation use shall be held in trust by the Village for expenditure
by the Village or by such other appropriate agency, as determined by the
Board of Trustees and as set out by intergovernmen-tal agreement.  Such cash
contributions shall be used solely for the acquisition of land for parks and
recreation which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of
the residents of the subdivision or development, or for the improvement of
recreation facilities and other parks already existing within the Village
which will benefit the development or subdivision.



            2.   The cash contributions in lieu of school
sites and the cash paid relating to high schools shall be held in trust by
the affected school district.  Such cash contributions shall be used for the
acquisition of land for a school site, the improvement of existing or new
sites or the construction of new schools, or the addition or improvement of
existing buildings to serve the immediate or future needs of children from
that development or subdivision or for the improvement to any existing school
site which will benefit the development or subdivision.



         c.   Refunds. If any portion of a cash contribution in
lieu of park and recreation land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of
school site land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth above
within fifteen (15) years from the date of receipt, said portion shall be
refunded to the applicant or any successors of such applicant who made such
contribution if so requested.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      6.   Transportation Exactions.



         a.   General Requirements.  All applicants shall
install improvements to the Village's trans-portation system that the Village
requires to serve the proposed development or subdivision, and shall pay an
exaction in lieu, as a condition of the development or subdivision approval.



         b.   Credit.  All applicants shall be entitled to a
credit against the payment of this transportation exaction for any of the
following improvements:



            1.   Any improvements required by the Village to
off-site roads not contiguous to the development;



            2.   Any road improvements to Township maintained
roads that are contiguous to the development that will be dedicated to the
Village pursuant to an agreement between the Township and the Village within
three (3) years after final approval by the Board of Trustees of the
subdivision or re-subdivision plat or final development plan pursuant to the
terms of Subsection E hereof.



            3.   Applicants will not be entitled to a credit
for road improvements which provide for safe access to the development,
including but not limited to turn lanes, deceleration lanes and road
widenings.  (Ord.2860 - 3/18/96)



         c.   Fair Share Exaction.  All applicants shall pay the
following transportation exaction, except applicants that are redeveloping
properties of similar impact that have already contributed transportation
exactions:



 

Residential:
 
$1,500 per lot or per dwelling unit, whichever is greater


Nonresidential:
 
$1.15 per sq. ft. for retail


 
 
$0.90 per sq. ft. for office


 
 
$0.60 per sq. ft. for industrial



 



   These fees are based on the expected traffic that will be generated by
each type of development, based on the estimated cost per lane mile.  If the
density or intensity of the development at the time of building permit
issuance exceeds that which the applicant had represented that he or she
would build at the time of plat approval, the applicant shall pay an
additional fee, based on the fees set forth in this Section.  If there is
any question regarding the appropriate category for a nonresidential
development for the purposes of this subsection, the nonresidential
development shall be treated as if the development belonged in the most
similar category, as determined by the Development Services Department or its
designee.  An applicant  may appeal this determination to the Board of
Trustees.  The Village may elect to assume the obligation of an exaction fee
as an incentive to encourage industrial and office development, so long as
the Village follows the standards and procedures adopted by the Village for
determining when such abatement is appropriate. (Amd. Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



         d.   Transportation Accounting Trust and Use of Fees.  
The cash contributions shall be held in trust by the Village, and shall be
used for the purpose of acquisition, expansion and development of the
transportation facilities that are needed to serve the immediate or future
needs of residents from that development or for the improvement to any
transportation facility which will benefit the development.  The funds
collected shall be expended for facilities that include, but are not limited
to:



            1.   design and construction plan preparation;



            2.   right-of-way acquisition;



            3.   site acquisition;



            4.   construction or improvement of new or
existing through lanes;



            5.   construction or improvement of new or
existing turn lanes;



            6.   construction or improvement of new or
existing bridges;



            7.   construction or improvement of new or
existing drainage facilities in conjunction with  roadway construction;



            8.   purchase and installation of street lighting
and traffic signalization; and



            9.   construction or improvement of new or
existing curbs, sidewalks, medians and shoulders.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      7.   Library Fees.



         a.   General Requirements.  All applicants for
residential developments within the Village shall pay a library fee in the
amount of $125.00 per each residential unit to the Village.  The cash
contribution shall be held in trust by the Village for expenditure by the
Orland Park Library Board.



         b.   Timing of Payment.   The fee shall be a one time
charge payable in full prior to the issuance of a building permit.



         c.   Use of Funds.   The library fees collected shall
be used only for library improvements and services.  Library "improvements
and services" are defined to include expenses for library personnel and
library operation, the cost of library buildings, books, and other materials.



         d.   Exemptions.  Applicants of the following
residential development shall be exempted from payment of the library fee:



            1.   Alterations or expansion of an existing
dwelling unit where no additional units are created and the use is not
changed.



            2.   The construction of accessory buildings or
structures which are not dwelling units and which do not constitute an
increase in intensity or use; and



            3.   The replacement of a destroyed or partially
destroyed building or structure of the same size and use.  (Ord. 2539 
3/21/94)



      8.   Criteria for Requiring Dedication and Contribution.  
There will be situations in developments when a combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary.  These
occasions will arise when:



         a.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is
proposed as the location for park and recrea-tion lands, school site purposes
or transportation facilities.  That portion of the land within the
development falling within any of these locations shall be dedicated as a
site and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any
additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; or



         b.   A major part of the local park and recreation land
or school site or transportation facility site has already been acquired and
only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the
site.  The small portion shall be dedicated and a cash contribution shall be
required in lieu of any additional land that would have been required to be
dedicated.



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      9.   Fair Market Value.  The cash contributions in lieu of
land shall be based on the "fair market value" of improved land in the
area.  Improved land for purposes of this Section is specified in Section 10
below.



         a.   The "fair market value" of such improved land is
$134,689 per acre as of January 1, 2009 for all properties within the Village
and its one and one half (1 ½) mile jurisdiction.  Refer to the Village of
Orland Park fee structure summary in the Development Services Department. 



(Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



         b.   The "fair market value" of such improved land is
$75,000 per acre until January 1, 1997, for all properties within the Village
and its one and one half (1 1/2) mile jurisdiction.  After January 1, 1997,
the "fair market value" shall be increased by a factor of five (5) percent
per annum, on January 1 of each year beginning with 1998.  Refer to the
Village of Orland Park fee structure summary in the Development Services
Department. 



         c.   The applicable figure shall be used in making any
calculation herein unless the applicant or an affected school district files
a written objection thereto with the Board of Trustees.  In the event of any
such objection, the applicant or affected school district shall submit an
appraisal by an appraiser mutually acceptable to the applicant and the Board
of Trustees.  The appraisal shall show the "fair market value" per acre of
such improved site as described in Subsection 10 (a) below in the area of the
development.  A final determination of said "fair market value" per acre of
such improved site shall be made by the Board of Trustees based upon such
information submitted by the appraiser and from other sources which may be
obtained by the Board of Trustees or the affected school district or the
applicant.  When evidence is presented to support a written objection, it
shall be specific to the applicable area:



            1.   Unincorporated areas of Orland and Palos
Townships. 



            2.   Unincorporated areas of Homer and Frankfort
Townships.



            3.   Village of Orland Park.



(Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00; Amd. Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      10.   Density Formula.



         a.   A document entitled, "Table of Estimated Ultimate
Population Per Dwelling Unit," prepared by the Illinois School Consulting
Service located in Naperville, Illinois, is attached hereto as Table
5-112(H)(9).  Such Table is generally indicative of current and short range
projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in
calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or cash
contributions in lieu thereof.  It is recognized that population density,
age distribution and local conditions change over a period of time. 
Therefore, the Table shall be updated every two (2) years, if felt necessary
in the opinion of the Board of Trustees to reflect the latest Table published
by the Illinois Consulting Service or a comparable organization.  If the
Board of Trustees fails to renew and update said Table, such failure shall
not be deemed to invalidate this Section or any parts hereof.



         b.   An applicant may file a written objection to Table
5-112(H)(9) with the Board of Trustees and shall submit his or her own
demographic study that shows the estimated additional population to be
generated from the development.  The Board of Trustees shall make a
determination of the density formula to be used in calculating the dedication
or contribution required herein after review of such demographic information.



         c.   An applicant of detached single family dwellings
with commonly maintained lots may present to the Board of Trustees written
evidence to support a request that the dwellings be treated as single family
attached dwellings for school impact fee purposes.  Such evidence shall
include, but need not be limited to, an anticipated resident profile,
discussion of marketing efforts to attract that profile, a description of the
common amenities to be provided and a discussion of why the proposed
development is expected to generate fewer school age children than a similar
single family development with privately maintained lots.  The Board of
Trustees shall make a determination after considering the evidence submitted
by the applicant.

   NOTE: There are only three (3) significant categories provided in this
chart. Because of the similarity of yields of all types of attached
single-family, only one category is provided. The same is true with
apartments; thus one category. Because of the relatively short history of
some newer types of detached and attached single-family units, individual
evaluations may be necessary. 



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      11.   Improved Sites.  All sites to be dedicated or conveyed
shall be improved by the applicant at his or her cost.  The improvement of
sites shall be guaranteed by giving security in conformance with the
requirements of Subsection E.



         a.   An "improved site" for purposes of this Section
shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:



            1.   Contour and grading and storm water
management;



            2.   All utilities to service the site consisting
of electric, water, sewer, streets, curbs and gutters and all required
drainage;



            3.   Sites for parks and recreation lands shall
include improvements for paved parking facilities sufficient to service such
sites;



            4.   Sites for park and recreation lands shall
comply with all landscape regulations es-tablished pursuant to the Village's
Zoning Ordinance; and



            5.   Other improvements that may be appropriate to
the site.



         b.   Responsibility. The improvement plans, installation
and security required by these regulations shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.



         c.   Plan Approval. Plans for the improvement of
dedicated sites shall be approved by the Board of Trustees as part of the
development's  final development approval.



         d.   Phasing. The improvement of all dedicated sites
shall be completed by the applicant before twenty percent (20%) of the
occupancy permits for dwelling units have been issued, or by another date as
determined by the Board of Trustees but in no event later than three (3)
years of final approval.



      12.   Reservation of Additional Land.   Where the
Comprehensive Plan or the designation by the Village calls for a larger
amount of land in a particular subdivision or planned development for school
sites, park and recreation use, transportation facilities, or as additional
public land than the applicant is required to dedicate, the land needed
beyond the applicant's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent
acquisition by the Village or the school district in accordance with the
requirements of the Illinois Municipal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, ?11-12-8.



      13.   Topography and Grading.   The slope, topography and
geology of the dedicated site and its surroundings must be suitable for its
intended purposes.  An applicant shall allow the Village or school district
to have access to proposed sites for the purpose of conducting soil boring
tests.



      14.   Timing of Conveyance   An applicant shall convey to the
Village, the affected school district, or such other governmental body,
corporation or other qualified owner as determined by the Village, the land
required under this Section at the time of final approval by the Board of
Trustees of the subdivision or resubdivision plat or final development plan,
by the delivery of the following documents:



(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



         a.   A good and sufficient Trustee's or Warranty Deed
conveying fee simple title free and clear of all liens and encumbrances
(except liens or encumbrances dischargeable by cash accompanying said deed)
except for current real estate taxes;



         b.   Preliminary commitment for title insurance issued
by a title insurance company acceptable to the Board of Trustees covering a
date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of conveyance in the
amount of the fair market value of the land to be conveyed as established
herein, subject only to the matters hereof, and to such other matters
acceptable to the Board of Trustees;



         c.   An affidavit of title to the real estate;



         d.   Completed Illinois Department of Revenue and Cook
County Real Estate Declarations;



         e.   A deposit of money equal to 115% of the most
ascertainable taxes for the year, pro-rated to the date the deed is delivered.



         f.   A plat of survey containing thereon the legal
description of the property to be conveyed and any other matters which may be
required by the Development Services Department or the school district. 
(Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      15.   Timing of Payment. Cash contributions required under
this Section shall be paid as follows:



         a.   All fees required pursuant to this Section,
including fees arising from the development of land located in the Village's
one and one-half (1-1/2) mile planning jurisdiction that may be the subject
of an intergovernmental agreement, shall be due and owing prior to final plat
approval by the Board of Trustees, or as provided by the terms of a developer
agreement entered into between the Village and an applicant.  However, if
the applicant's lands are the subject matter of an annexation agreement,
payment shall be made at the times and in the manner provided in said
annexation agreement.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



         b.   It shall be the duty of the Village Comptroller to
establish regulations and procedures for the collection and administration of
the cash contributions required under this Section.



      16.   Credit for Land or Contribution of Cash in Lieu of Land
Given Under Annexation Agreements.   If an applicant has given land and a
contribution of money or a contribution of cash in lieu of land as part of an
annexation agreement and thereafter the applicant or his or her successors
submits a plan of subdivision or resubdivision or final development plan
which will increase the density of population in those areas covered by the
annexation agreement, then the applicant shall be required to make an
additional contribution of park and recreation land or land for school sites
or land for transportation facilities or of cash in lieu thereof as outlined
above.  The additional land or cash in lieu of land to be contributed shall
be the difference between that land or cash in lieu of land required as
determined from the plat of subdivision or resubdivision or final development
plan and that land or cash in lieu of land previously contributed under the
annexation agreement.



      17.   Developer Agreements.  The Village may enter into a
developer agreement with any applicant which sets forth the time and manner
of compliance with the terms of this Section and implementation of any other
provisions of these regulations.  If any developer agreement has previously
been entered into between the Village and an applicant, and that agreement
remains in full force and effect, the provisions of that agreement shall
control and this Section shall have no force and effect, provided that the
applicant complies with the terms of such agreement.  However, if such
applicant is not complying with the terms of that agreement or the agreement
does not set forth a specific dollar amount that the applicant is required to
pay to the Village, then the provisions of this Section shall apply and the
Village shall utilize the fees set forth herein to determine the appropriate
exaction amount, less credits, if any.  Further, if the development
contemplated by an applicant has either increased in density or has otherwise
increased the traffic on the Village's transportation system previously
estimated following annexation, then the developer agreement previously
entered into between the applicant and the Village shall be amended and the
applicant shall pay an additional pro-rata fee, based on the fees set forth
in this Section, less credits, if any.  (Ord. 4412 - 9/2/08)



      18.   Audit Reports.  The Village shall have the right to
request and receive from the affected school districts, or such other
appropriate agencies, annual audit reports and any other information the
Village may need from time to time to insure compliance with this Section.



      19.   Indemnification.  The affected school districts, or
such other appropriate agencies, shall be required, as a condition of
receiving the donations hereunder, to indemnify and hold harmless the Village
from any loss, claims and causes of actions of every kind incurred by the
Village as a result, either directly or indirectly, of the passage of this
Section, or the administration or enforcement thereof, including any so
incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought or threatened by an applicant.. 
If the Village is sued by any applicant as a result, directly or indirectly,
of the passage of this Section, the school district or other appropriate
agencies affected may, at its option, undertake the defense thereof but all
costs and expenses of such defense, including attorneys' fees, shall then be
borne by the affected school district or appropriate agencies.  (Ord. 4412 -
9/2/08)

SECTION 6-101.   ZONING DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.



(Entire Section Amended by Ord. 4374 - 6/2/08)



   A.   Purpose. In order to carry out the goals and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan of the Village and the purposes of these regulations, the
following districts are hereby created:



      1.   E-1   Estate Residential District



      2.   R-1   Residential District

      14.   OL   Open Lands District (Ord. 4217 - 2/5/07)



      15.   RMC   Regional Mixed-Use Campus (Ord. 5168 

   B.   Boundaries. The boundaries of these districts are described on
the Zoning District Map, attached hereto and incorporated herein.



SECTION 6-102.   ZONING DISTRICT MAP.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of the Zoning District Map is to set
forth the boundaries of the zoning districts established in Section 6-101 as
they may be applied from time to time to all land within the corporate limits
of the Village.



   B.   Interpretation of Boundaries.   Where uncertainty exists with
respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Zoning
District Map amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5-108 of these regulations, the following rules shall be used to
interpret the maps:



      1.   In cases where a boundary line is located within a street
or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, or
navigable or non-navigable waterway, it shall be considered to be in the
center of the right-of-way, easement or waterway.  If the actual location of
such right-of-way, easement, or waterway varies slightly from the location as
shown on the map, then the actual location shall control.



      2.   In cases where the map shows a boundary line as being
located a specific distance from a street line or other physical feature,
this distance shall control.



      3.   Where the map shows a district boundary to approximately
coincide with a property line or Village limit line, the property line or
Village limit line shall be considered to be the district boundary, unless
otherwise indicated.



      4.   In cases where a district boundary does not coincide or
approximately coincide with any street, alley, railroad, waterway, or
property line, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary
shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.



   C.   Maintenance of Map.   The originals of the Zoning District Map
shall be signed by the Village Clerk and the President of the Board of
Trustees and retained in the offices of the Village Clerk.  Copies of the
Zoning District Map shall be maintained by the Village and kept up-to-date by
posting thereon all changes and subsequent amendments.  (Ord. 4374 - 6/30/08)



   D.   Update.  The Zoning District Map shall be updated twice a year
and shall be published in accordance with Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, sec.
11-13-19 (1989).



SECTION 6-103.   ZONING OF NEWLY ANNEXED LAND AND REZONING.



   A.   Annexation.  All fully developed land which shall be annexed
to the Village shall be classified into the zoning district that is most
compatible, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, with the Village's
Comprehensive Plan.  All undeveloped or partially developed land which shall
be annexed to the Village shall be automatically classified and zoned in the
E-1 Estate Residence District until otherwise classified in accordance with
the Village's Comprehensive Plan.



   B.   Petition For Annexation.  The owner of any land proposed for
annexation to the Village shall file with the Development Services Department
a petition for annexation.  The Development Services Department shall review
such application and shall recommend to the Board of Trustees whether such
annexation should be approved.  If such petition involves a zoning
classification other than E-1, the petition shall be referred to the Plan
Commission which shall recommend to the Board of Trustees the appropriate
zoning district in accordance with the procedures of Section 5-108.  If such
petition involves an annexation agreement, the provisions of Ill. Rev. Stat.
Ch. 24, ?7-1-2, as amended, shall be followed.  (Ord. 4374 - 6/2/08)



   C.   Proposal for Rezoning. If a petition or application is made
requesting a map amendment to a property other than E-1, the petition goes to
Plan Commission as a public hearing and shall include a site plan in its
submission to the Development Services Department.  (Ord. 4374 - 6/2/08)

SECTION 6-104.   BULK REGULATIONS.



   A.   General.



      1.   All development, except as provided by special use, must
conform to the minimum bulk regulations as set out in this Section.



      2.   No building, structure or land located in the Village
shall be used or occupied, and no building or structure shall be erected,
moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered unless in accordance with
the minimum lot area, lot width, setback and open space requirements set
forth on Table 6-104(A) or as otherwise required by these regulations.



      3.   No setbacks existing on the effective date of these
regulations shall subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced below if
already less than the minimum setback requirements set out in Table 6-104(A)
for equivalent new construction.



      4.   No lot shall hereafter be divided into two (2) or more
lots unless all lots resulting from such division conform with all applicable
minimum lot size requirements of the zoning district in which such lots are
located or as otherwise provided in these regulations.



      5.   (Reserved.)



      6.   Any lot which was of record at the time of the adoption
of these regulations, and which does not meet the requirements for minimum
lot width and area set forth on Table 6-104(A), may be utilized for a use
permitted under the zoning district in which the lot is located, provided
that the applicable setbacks and other provisions of these regulations are
met. (Amd. Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



(Table 6-104(A), including amendments by Ord. 2514  1/17/94, Ord. 4015 -
5/2/05, Ord. 4926  9/15/14, Ord. 5126  9/19/16, and Ord. 5168 
2/20/17, was deleted by Ord. 5312  7/16/18.)



   B.   Lot Coverage.



      1.   Location of Required Open Space.



         a.   Open spaces shall be maintained on all lots outside
of the required building setback (the building envelope), unless otherwise
enabled by these regulations as accessory uses and structures.  Required
building setbacks shall be measured inward from the property lines of the
subject site.



         b.   No required setbacks, other open space, or minimum
lot area allocated to a building shall be used to satisfy the setbacks or
other open space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building.



      2.   Uses and Structures Prohibited in Required Setbacks.



         a.   No principal building or structure shall be located
within any setback required by these regulations.



         b.   Except as otherwise provided in Section 6-306 of
these regulations, no off-street parking area, maneuvering area for parking
spaces, or loading area shall be located within any required front setback or
within any required side setback which abuts a street.  This restriction
shall not apply to driveways of single family detached dwellings providing
access from the street to the parking area.



         c.   No outdoor storage of goods and materials or refuse
containers shall be located within any required front setback, or within any
required side setback which abuts a street, except for the temporary
placement of refuse containers for curbside pick-up in residential districts.



      3.   Maintenance of Setbacks and Other Open Spaces.   The
maintenance of setbacks and other open spaces and minimum lot areas set forth
on Table 6-104(A) shall be a continuing obligation of the owner(s) of the
property.



      4.   Required Building Setbacks v. Actual Building Setbacks. 
The regulations of this section and the subsequent zoning districts establish
the required building setbacks for the lots of each zoning district,
effectively establishing a building envelope in which to erect principal
structures, additions and accessory uses and structures.  The setbacks of
each zoning district shall be interpreted to read as the required setbacks. 
In  the case when a principal building is set back further than the required
setback, the actual setback, being more restrictive, shall not govern nor
override the ability of a property owner to construct within the zone's
established building envelope, which meets the required building setbacks. 
The exception to this is fences and similar accessory structures, which have
regulations regarding presence in front yard spaces. (Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



   C.   Number of Buildings Per Lot.  No more than one (1) principal
building devoted to a single use shall be located on a lot, except as
approved as a special use for planned development in accordance with these
regulations.  (Ord. 3130 - 5/18/98)



   D.   Height Limitations.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Subsection and listed below, height limitations for all structures are listed
in each district, in Sections 6-201 through 6-213.



      1.   The height limitation established for each district shall
not apply to public utility poles and lines, skylights, fire towers, spires,
cooling towers, parapet walls, co-located wireless communication facilities,
and roof structures for elevators, stairways, tanks, heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning equipment, or similar equipment for the operation and
maintenance of a building.



      2.   Unless located in or adjacent to a residential district,
the height limitation shall not apply to radio or television towers,
steeples, chimneys, and water tanks. Freestanding wireless communication
facilities must meet the height requirements of Section 6-311.



      3.   Structures exempted from the maximum height provisions by
Subsections (1) and (2) above may not exceed a height of ten (10) feet above
the average roof line of the building to which they are affixed or adjacent
unless permitted by a special use permit. Wireless communication facilities
shall follow the height regulations of Section 6-311. (Amd. Ord. 4926 -
9/15/14)



   E.   Clear Sight Triangles at Street Intersections.



      1.   The restrictions set out in this Subsection shall apply
to the following triangles of land abutting street intersections:



         a.   Arterial streets:  The triangle bounded on two (2)
sides by the curb (or pavement edge where there is no curb), measured in each
direction along the curb or pavement edge for 50 feet from their point of
intersection or pavement edge, and on the third side by the diagonal line
connecting the ends of the 50-foot sides; and



         b.   Collector streets:  The triangle bounded on two
(2) sides by the inter-secting street lines, measured 35 feet in each
direction from their point of intersection, and on the third side by the
diagonal line connecting the ends of the 35-foot sides.



      2.   Within the triangles identified in Subsection (1) 
above, and except as provided in Subsection (3) below, no structure, sign,
plant, shrub, tree, berm, fence, wall, or other object of any kind shall be
installed, constructed, set out or maintained so as to obstruct
cross-visibility at a level between 30 and 72 inches above the height of the
curb.



      3.   The restrictions of this Subsection shall not apply to:



         a.   Existing natural grades which, by reason of natural
topography, rise 30 or more inches above the level of the center of the
adjacent intersection;



         b.   Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed in such a
manner that no limbs or foliage extend into the area between 30 and 72 inches
above the level of the center of the adjacent intersection; and



         c.   Fire hydrants, public utility poles, street
markers, and traffic control devices.



   F.   Obstruction of Public Right-of Way.   Except as otherwise

parking lot, newspaper vending machine or mailbox shall be permitted which
obstructs or otherwise interferes with public use of a street right-of-way or
other public easement.

including duplexes and townhomes, and condominium and cooperative buildings.
For residential developments with square corner lots, the "front" setback
shall be considered to be the yard where the main door is located; the other
yard shall therefore be considered to be the "side" setback.



            1.   Front.



               i.   Major or Minor Arterial: Forty-five

STREET NAME
 
MINIMUM BUILDING SETBACK FROM STREET
 
PURPOSE OF THE SETBACK AREA




All streets, except as below
 
25 feet
 
For streets carrying moderate to high regional and local traffic, a setback
area of 25 feet will be required. This will allow commercial buildings to
maintain high visibility from the streets, and also provide a significant
landscaped area along the street.


Exceptions:


LaGrange Road
 
35 feet
 
LaGrange Road is proposed to be widened to a six lane arterial with a
landscaped median. A larger setback area is being proposed for this street to
distinguish it from other arterials. The wider setback will allow substantial
landscaping that will add a sense of scale, safety and enclosure to this high
speed corridor, and help create a unique look for the street.


147th Street
 
15 feet
 
For pedestrian oriented streets that also carry moderate local traffic, a
setback area of 15 feet is required. This will encourage building entrances
to connect directly to the sidewalk, while allowing landscaping with low
plantings along the street.


Ravinia Avenue


West Avenue


144th Place


149th Street


157th Street
 
0 to 15 feet
 
These special pedestrian oriented streets shall be defined by buildings with
active street fronts, multiple entrances and well articulated street facades,
and by parkway trees along the sidewalk. Buildings shall be allowed to be
placed at the lot line or set back up to 15 feet to strengthen the pedestrian
character of the street.


142nd Street


Ravinia extension (north of 143rd Street and south of 159th Street)

(Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



      2.   Building Setbacks from rear and side lot lines that do
not abut a street



         All buildings must maintain a minimum of 30 feet of setback
area from the rear lot line and a minimum of 15 feet of setback area from the
side lot lines that do not abut a street.



      3.   Permitted Uses in Building Setback Areas along Streets



         Setback areas will be primarily used for landscaping and
other pedestrian oriented uses including:

         f.   Benches and complementary site furniture.



         The setback area can be expanded to accommodate the above
pedestrian oriented uses if needed. Architectural features that help to
create a stronger pedestrian scale can extend into the setback area up to 10
feet, including:



         g.   Canopies, marquees and other projections that
create shaded and protected entrances;



         h.   Extended roofs and eaves;



         i.   Awnings and canopies over windows;



         j.   Projecting blade signs that comply with the
Village's sign ordinance;

12/20/10)



         d.   Any order windows and menu boxes must be designed
to integrate into the architecture of the building and appear 'hidden' from
vehicular and pedestrian view.  All efforts should be made to keep the order
windows and menu boxes out of the setback between the building and the
street. 



            1.   Menu boxes must include masonry architectural
details, matching the materials and design of the building.



            2.   Menu boxes must be screened with landscaping
and/or masonry walls so they are not visible from the street.



            3.   Order windows must be designed with trim and
detail so they appear similar in appearance to other windows on the building.



         e.   The drop off area or drive aisle must be screened
with a combination of masonry walls and/or decorative landscaping in order to
provide a solid buffer at a minimum height of 36".



         f.   The drop off area or drive aisle shall not obstruct
any direct connections between the sidewalk along the street and the
entrances to the building and shall include crosswalks connection pedestrian
routes.

will be allowed up to 50% when Best Management Practices (BMP) such as porous
pavements and green roofs are used. Up to 40% of the BMPs will be considered
pervious, provided that the design standards outlined in the code for BMPs
are met.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02; Amd. Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



   G.   Height.



      No single-family residential structure may exceed 2-1/2 stores or

SECTION 6-207.   BIZ GENERAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.



   A.   Purpose.  The BIZ General Business district is established to
provide a location for higher-volume and higher intensity commercial uses
than the RSB district, including establishments involving heavy equipment,
and the processing and distribution of goods, which provide employment and
revenues for the Village.  Due to the higher volume of these uses, and the
automobile and truck traffic they typically generate, it is intended that the
BIZ District be located only along major and minor collectors and arterials
in order to ensure that the traffic generated by such uses does not adversely
impact nearby residential neighborhoods.  Recognizing the impacts such uses
may have on adjacent residential areas and the overall character of the
Village, the development standards for the BIZ District are designed to
buffer the BIZ District from nearby residential properties and to maintain
the general appearance of major thoroughfares through the Village.



   B.   Permitted Uses.  The following uses may be established as
permitted uses in the BIZ District in buildings up to 50,000 square feet
unless otherwise limited below, in accordance with the procedures established
in Sections 5-101 through 5-104:



      1.   Accessory uses, as provided in Section 6-302;



      2.   Building material sales;  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02)

provided that:



         a.   No bus stop shelter is located within thirty-five
(35) feet of a street intersection or within a clear sight triangle
identified in Section 6-301(E); and



         b.   The design of the bus shelter is compatible with
development of nearby properties.



(Ord. 4374  6/2/08)



      4.   Clinics and medical or dental offices; Medical offices
may require an entrance canopy.

TABLE 6-207.F.1 (A)



 

STREET NAME
 
MINIMUM BUILDING SETBACK FROM STREET
 
PURPOSE OF THE SETBACK AREA




All streets, except as below
 
25 feet
 
For streets carrying moderate to high regional and local traffic, a setback
area of 25 feet will be required. This will allow commercial buildings to
maintain high visibility from the streets, and also provide a significant
landscaped area along the street.


Exceptions:


LaGrange Road
 
25 feet
 
LaGrange Road is proposed to be widened to a six lane arterial with a
landscaped median. This setback area will distinguish it from other arterials
as the main commercial area of the Village. The setback will allow
landscaping that will add a sense of scale, safety and enclosure to the
corridor, and help create a unique look for the street. (Amd. Ord. 4996 
6/15/15)


147th Street
 
15 feet
 
For pedestrian oriented streets that also carry moderate local traffic, a
setback area of 15 feet is required. This will encourage building entrances
to connect directly to the sidewalk, while allowing landscaping with low
plantings along the street.


Ravinia Avenue


West Avenue


144th Place


149th Street


151st Street, between Ravinia Avenue and West Avenue (Ord. 3990  2/21/05)


157th Street
 
0 to 15 feet
 
These special pedestrian oriented streets shall be defined by buildings with
active street fronts, multiple entrances and well articulated street facades,
and by parkway trees along the sidewalk. Buildings shall be allowed to be
placed at the lot line or set back up to 15 feet to strengthen the pedestrian
character of the street.


142nd Street


Ravinia extension (north of 143rd Street and south of 159th Street)


161st Street


160th Street


95th Avenue




 



      2.   Building Setbacks from rear and side lot lines that do
not abut a street



      All buildings must maintain a minimum of 30 feet of setback area
from the rear lot line and a minimum of 15 feet of setback area from the side
lot lines that do not abut a street.



      3.   Permitted Uses in Building Setback Areas along Streets



         Setback areas will be primarily used for landscaping and
other pedestrian oriented uses including:



         a.   Widened sidewalks and entranceways;



         b.   Plazas, outdoor gardens, patios and outdoor seating
areas;



         c.   Water features, including bioswales or other
stormwater management elements;



         d.   Public art or outdoor architectural features like
clock towers, pergolas etc.;



         e.   Pergolas and/or arbor structures;



         f.   Benches and complementary site furniture.



         The setback area can be expanded to accommodate the above
pedestrian oriented uses if needed. Architectural features that help to
create a stronger pedestrian scale can extend into the setback area up to 10
feet, including:



         g.   Canopies, marquees and other projections that
create shaded and protected entrances;



         h.   Extended roofs and eaves;



         i.   Awnings and canopies over windows;



         j.   Projecting blade signs that comply with the
Villages sign ordinance;



         k.   Tensile Canopies that project over outdoor
congregation areas.



         (Amd. Ord. 5061  1/18/16; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      4.   Uses Not Permitted In Building Setbacks Along Streets



         Parking lots or structures (exception cited below),
drive-through facilities, loading facilities or trash enclosures are not
allowed within the setback area between the building facade and the street.



         Drive through facilities in the setback area shall be
allowed via Special Use modification only, when there are no reasonable
alternatives. In order to qualify for a Special Use Modification, the drive
through facility must meet all of the following conditions:



         a.   The drive through should be designed as a single
lane with a maximum width of 14' and a minimum turning radius of 20' from the
centerline of the drive aisle.



         b.   Drive through lanes must be a minimum of 10' from
all property lines.



         c.   The drop off area or drive aisle must be
constructed with decorative pavement or pervious pavers.  (Ord. 4610 
12/20/10)



         d.   Any order windows and menu boxes must be designed
to integrate into the architecture of the building and appear hidden' from
vehicular and pedestrian view.  All efforts should be made to keep the order
windows and menu boxes out of the setback between the building and the
street. 



            1.   Menu boxes must include masonry architectural
details, matching the materials and design of the building.



            2.   Menu boxes must be screened with landscaping
and/or masonry walls so they are not visible from the street.



            3.   Order windows must be designed with trim and
detail so they appear similar in appearance to other windows on the building.



         e.   The drop off area or drive aisle must be screened
with a combination of masonry walls and/or decorative landscaping in order to
provide a solid buffer at a minimum height of 36".



         f.   The drop off area or drive aisle shall not obstruct
any direct connections between the sidewalk along the street and the
entrances to the building and shall include crosswalks connection pedestrian
routes.



(Ord. 4535  1/18/10; Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



      5.   Parking Lot Setbacks



         A minimum landscaped setback must be provided between the
parking lot and the primary street right-of-way that accommodates the
required landscape bufferyard area per Section 6-305.



(Ord. 4015  5/2/05; Amd. Ord. 4792  2/4/13)



   G.   Lot Coverage. No more than seventy-five (75) percent of the
area of the parcel proposed for development shall be covered with building,
pavement and storm water storage, leaving at least twenty-five percent (25%)
of total parcel area in green space. (See Section 2-102 Definitions "Green
Space"). Impervious coverage will be allowed up to 80% when Best Management
Practices (BMP) such as porous pavements and green roofs are used. Up to 40%
of the BMPs will be considered pervious, provided that the design standards
outlined in the code for BMPs are met.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02; Amd. Ord. 4374
 6/2/08; Amd. Ord. 4574  7/6/10)



   H.   Height.  No structure may exceed four (4) stories or fifty
(50) feet, whichever is higher, nor cast a shadow on adjacent residential

SECTION 6-209: Old Orland Historic District



(Entire Section Amended by Ord. 4131, 4/17/06)



Vision



The Old Orland Historic District is Orland Park's oldest neighborhood and the
historic heart of the Village. It has a picturesque turn-of-the-century
collection of small shops, historic churches and attractive houses. The
Village Center, McGinnis Slough, Humphrey Woods and the train station are
within close walking distance. To ensure that Old Orland retains its unique
character and special sense of place, the Village offers the following vision
for the area:



   New development will respect the established character of this historic
neighborhood - narrow tree lined streets, small walkable blocks, buildings on
small lots, and gardens and outdoor spaces for people to enjoy. Contributing
buildings will be preserved for future generations. Historic churches,
museums and other civic buildings will continue to be places where the
community comes to gather, learn and celebrate. The area will attract small
businesses and unique local stores, and also be a great place to live. Trails
will connect the area to woods and forest nearby.

List of Contributing Structures with Photos



1.   Orland Park School, 9960 W. 143rd Street. The center two-story brick
portion of the school was built in 1922 and the gymnasium to the west was
added in 1940. The distinctive stone walls of the gymnasium are made of
Joliet limestone. This is the most substantial of buildings in the Old Orland
area.



2.   Former Christ Lutheran Church, 9999 W. 143rd Street. Erected in 1898,
this simple wood frame building is typical of many Gothic Revival rural
churches of the period. It has not been altered significantly. The small
building south of the church was built in 1922 as a school house.



3.   Former Residence, 9953 W. 143rd Street. This small, simple frame
building was built around 1890. The original materials and building elements
have been unaltered. This is a fine example of a National style building with
Folk Victorian detailing in the district.



4.   Former Residence, 9925 W. 143rd Street. This two-story Italianate
structure from the 1880's has some nice decorative elements. Except for later
residing, this building appears to have had no significant alterations.



5.   Orland Park Library, 9917 W. 143rd Street. This commercial building
with Tudor styling was built in 1937 and once served as Orland Park's first
public library.



6.   Orland Park Hotel, 14306-10 Union Avenue. This frame commercial
building was originally the Orland Park Hotel. The ornate Italianate trim
dates to the early 1880's. Although the building has been resided and the
fenestration of the first floor has been rebuilt, it is still the most ornate
early structure in Orland Park.



7.   Loebe Bros. General Store, 14314 Union Avenue. This was the first
general store in Orland Park. The building appears to be a series of
buildings that were added onto each other. Most of them appear to date from
the early 1880's to mid 1890's. The front is particularly well preserved.



8.   Loebe House, 9952 W. 144th Street. This large residence from about
1895 is an excellent example of the Queen Anne style. The house shows typical
features of Queen Anne houses in the use of bay windows, patterned shingles
along the sides and gables, and a tower to break the flat wall surfaces.



9.   Twin Towers Sanctuary, 9967 144th Street. Designed by Chicago
architect William Arthur Bennet and constructed in 1898, the twin octagonal
towers make this the most imposing and visible landmark in Old Orland. This
building was substantially renovated by the Old Orland Heritage Foundation.
In 1987, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places.



10.   Orland State Bank, 14316 Beacon Avenue. Built in 1910, this well
preserved brick building is a good example of Italianate commercial buildings
once common in the Midwest.



11.   Commercial Emporium, 14320-24 Beacon Avenue. Built approximately in
1885, this is an unusual combination of Commercial, Italianate and National
building style.



12.   Former Residence, 14330 Beacon Avenue. This well preserved frame
building was likely constructed in the late 1880's or early 1890's. The
wealth of Queen Anne decorations have survived since the house was built.



13.   Former Residence, 14315 Beacon Avenue. This two story Folk Victorian
building dates back to the 1880's and is typical of many residences
constructed during this period in Old Orland.



14.   Residence, 14339 Beacon Avenue. This single story residence in the
National style was built in 1890. Many of the original building features have
been restored.



15.   Residence, 14420 Second Avenue. Constructed in 1880, this house is
believed to be the first residence built in Orland Park. The front bay
windows and the roof that joins them were later additions at the turn of the
20th Century. The porch and garage building along Second Avenue were
additions at the turn of the 21st Century.



16.   John Humphrey House, 9830 W. 144th Place. This stately two story
Italianate frame residence was built in 1881 by the late Sir John Humphrey, a
prominent early resident of the Orland area and Orland Park's first Mayor.
The interior has been restored with authentic furnishings and is maintained
by the Orland Historical Society. This building was added to the National
Register of Historic Places in 2005.



More detailed information about these buildings is available from the Village
of Orland Park.

Historic Architectural Styles in the District



The Old Orland Historic District has a collection of modest homes in a
variety of styles, including National, Folk Victorian, Commercial and
Commercial Italianate, Craftsman, Queen Anne, Gothic and Tudor Revival. The
early buildings of the historic district were made of wood frame with wood
siding and trim. Some later commercial buildings are of brick. The various
architectural styles of buildings in the Historic District are described with
examples below. While some buildings have elements of many other
architectural styles, they were classified under the predominant style.



National (1835-1895)



National is the term given to indigenous forms of building construction. Some
refer to National buildings as Vernacular style. Although buildings continued
to be constructed according to the earlier traditional folk forms, the
increased availability of lumber (mill-sawn lumber was available after 1850)
led to some new shape innovations. Folk form, or vernacular buildings are
typically of frame construction and covered with wood siding. Some may have
details taken from high styles such as Greek Revival or Colonial Revival;
others may have later high style modifications. Some of the many variants of
the vernacular identified in the survey area are:



Four-over-Four: A side gable, two story, center entry house, two rooms deep
and two rooms wide.







Example: 9830 W. 144th Place (top left)



Gable-Front: During the Greek Revival movement in the period between 1830 and
1850, the front-gabled shape was commonly used to echo the pedimented façade
of typical Greek temples. This form was particularly common in New England
and its popularity expanded along the with the expansion of the railroad
network and remained a dominant folk form until well into the 20th century.
Part of its staying power reflected the fact that gable-front houses were
well suited for narrow urban lots, which were found in many rapidly
developing cities.







Examples: 14438 Second Avenue (left), 9953 W. 143rd Street, 14329 Beacon
Avenue, 14420 First Avenue and 9856 W. 144th Place



Gabled L: This house form also descended from styled Greek Revival houses and
the gable-front form. This variant shows an additional side-gabled wing added
at right angles to the gable-front plan to give a compound,
gable-front-and-wing shape with uniform roof height. A shed-roofed porch was
typically placed within the L made by the two wings. This form is also
commonly known as Gable-Front-and-Wing.







Example: 9833 W. 144th Place



Hipped: Massed-plan folk house of nearly square plan are commonly built with
hipped or pyramidal roofs. It may be one or two stories high. Hipped folk
houses differ principally in roof pitch and in the size and placement of
porches. Many one story houses have full or partial integral porches included
under the principal roof.







Examples: 9999 W. 143rd Street at West Avenue and 9853 W. 144th Place (right)



Side Gable: This house form, with a side gable and massed-plan (more than one
room deep) was very popular after lightweight lumber became widely available
by the railroads. Simpler methods of light roof framing led to these
massed-plan houses which had larger and more flexible interior plans,
therefore, eventually replacing the traditional one room deep Hall-and-Parlor
and I-House forms.







Example: 14420 Second Avenue (right)



Upright-and-Wing: This house form is similar to the Gabled L. It is usually a
one and a half to two story front gable house with a one-to-one and a half
story wing at right angles of lesser height. A porch was often placed in the
area formed by the gable front and wing. Some Upright-and-Wing houses may
have started out as a Front Gable to which a wing was added.







Examples: 9855 W. 144th Street and 9976 w. 144th Street (the latter is shown
at right)



Craftsman (1905-1930)



Craftsman was the dominant style for smaller houses built across the country
during the period between 1905 through the mid-1920's. By the end of the
1920's, the style was fading from popularity and few were built after 1930.
Common characteristics include low-pitched, gabled or hipped roof with wide,
unenclosed eave overhang; exposed roof rafters; decorative beams or knee
braces under gables; porches, full or partial width, with roof supported by
tapered square columns, often of brick or stone material; dormers often with
exposed rafter ends and knee braces; usually shed or gable roof; windows
designed with a horizontal emphasis.







Examples: 14407 Beacon Avenue (shown at right) and 9955 W. 144th Street



Commercial Vernacular or Commercial/ Storefront (1880-1900)



Early vernacular commercial buildings are referred to as Commercial
Vernacular. These buildings are identified by their form, not their
architectural style, although they may have some decorative features taken
from architectural styles, often Italianate or Classical. These buildings are
typically found in main street areas. Common characteristics include street
facades abutting one another and sited at the lot line; false fronts visible
at the roof line of the typically gable roof; buildings in relative scale
with adjacent commercial vernacular buildings; typical three part facades:
storefront, upper stories, and cornice or parapet; most often of wood with
transoms above storefronts, and decorative cornices.







Examples: 14300 Beacon Avenue, 14320 Beacon Avenue, 14306 Union Avenue
(right) and 14314 Union Avenue



20th Century Commercial (1900- )



Later Commercial Vernacular buildings are referred to as 20th Century
Commercial Style. These buildings are identified by their form and materials,
not their architectural style, although they may have some decorative
features taken from architectural styles. Common characteristics include
facades of brick or stone with contrasting masonry ornament; street facades
abutting one another and sited at the lot line; buildings in relative scale
with adjacent commercial vernacular buildings.







Examples: 14316 Beacon Avenue (right) and 9875 W. 143rd Street



Folk Victorian (1870-1910)



This style is defined by the presence of Victorian decorative detailing on
simple folk house forms, and generally much less elaborated than the
Victorian styles that they attempt to mimic. The details are usually of
either Italianate or Queen Anne inspiration. The primary areas for the
application of this detailing are the porch and cornice line. Common
characteristics include porches with spindle-work detailing or flat, jig-saw
cut trim; turned balusters used both in porch railings and in friezes
suspended from the porch ceiling; roof-wall junction may be either boxed or
open; simple window surrounds with simple pediment above.







Examples: 14315 Beacon Avenue, 14330 Beacon Avenue (bottom right), 14339
Beacon Avenue and 9852 W. 144th Place



Georgian Revival (1880-1955)



The Georgian Revival style is more commonly grouped under the Colonial
Revival style, which includes Georgian, Adam and Dutch. Colonial Revival
refers to the entire rebirth of interest in the early English and Dutch
houses of the Atlantic seaboard. The Georgian and Adam styles form the
backbone of the Revival, with secondary influences from post medieval English
or Dutch Colonial prototypes. The principal areas of elaboration are
entrances, cornices and windows. Common characteristics include an
accentuated front door, normally with a decorative pediment supported by
pilasters, or extended forward and supported by slender columns to form the
entry porch; doors, commonly with overhead fanlights or sidelights; a façade
normally showing symmetrically balanced windows and center door; windows with
double-hung sashes, usually with multi-pane glazing in one or both sashes,
and frequently in adjacent pairs.







Example: 9960 W. 143rd Street (left)



Gothic Revival (1840-1880)



The Gothic Revival style, based on English precedents, was promoted as an
ideal picturesque rural style, suitable for residential use. The style was
loosing popularity for residential designs by the late 1860's, but resurgence
during the 1870's occurred when the style was applied to public and religious
buildings. Common characteristics include a steeply pitched roof, usually
with steep cross gables; roofs often topped with pinnacles; gables, commonly
with decorated vergeboards; wall surfaces extend into a gable without a
break; windows commonly extended into a gable, frequently having pointed-arch
shape (Gothic arch); doors often with pointed-arch and/or heavy hood ornament.







Example: 9999 W. 143rd Street (left)



Italianate (1840-1885)



A popular 19th century style, the Italianate was derived from the
architecture of Italian villas and originated in England at the start of the
Picturesque Movement. This style with its wide overhanging bracketed eaves
was typically found on two and three story buildings. Often this style
included a cupola. Common characteristics include vertical proportions; wide
eaves and intricate cornices; large brackets, sometimes paired; tall, curved
or arched topped windows and doors with hooded molds; porches, both small
entry and full width, of single story height; paired and single doors,
commonly with large-pane glazing in the door itself.







Examples: 9925 W. 143rd Street (left) and 14306 Union Avenue.



Prairie (1900-1925)



An American style of architecture that originated with the Prairie School,
popular in the Midwest from about 1900 to 1930. Characteristics include
broad, low-pitched roof, and hipped eaves usually with a very wide overhang;
light colored stucco exterior walls, brick or concrete block; contrasting
wood trim between stories; Sullivanesque  ornamentation such as friezes
and/or door surrounds; ribbon windows below roof overhang, emphasizing the
horizontal plane.







Example: 9960 W. 143rd Street (top right)



Queen Anne (1880-1910)



The very popular style of the 1880's and 1890's has asymmetrical shapes
characterized by projecting bays and prominent, compound roof shapes. A one
story porch along the front sometimes wraps around the side. These buildings
were clad in a variety of materials and with multiple textures including
patterned shingles. Common characteristics include an abundance of
decoration; varied and rich contrasting materials, shapes and textures;
expansive, encircling porches; turrets or conical towers; pressed metal bays;
irregular roofline with many dormers and chimneys; some may have
half-timbering with windows grouped three or more.







 







Examples: 9952 W. 144th Street (sketch at right) and 9967 W. 144th Street
(middle right)



Tudor Revival (1890-1940)



A popular romantic revival style from the first half of the 20th century,
Tudor Revival was a romantic inspiration based on English medieval buildings.
The style is recognized by the use of a steeply pitched side gable or hipped
roof, with one or more front facing, asymmetrically placed gables. Common
characteristics include walls of masonry, brick, stucco and half-timbering
most commonly used in a mixture; mullions, transoms, and trim of stone are
typical, as are rounded Tudor arch door openings; tall, narrow windows,
double-hung or casement, often with leaded glass; multiple and overlapping
dormers; multi-colored slate on the roof; massive chimneys, often stone or
stucco with stone ornament.

A.   Purpose.



   The purpose of the Old Orland Historic District (OOH) is to retain the
commercial and residential character of the original core of Orland Park. It
is also the purpose of this district to encourage the restoration and
preservation of historically and architecturally significant structures that
are an important part of the Village's heritage. To maintain the historic,
semi-residential character of the district, commercial development is limited
to certain streets: 143rd Street, Beacon Avenue between 143rd Street and
144th Place, Union Avenue between 143rd Street and Brook Avenue, and in the
existing commercial portion of West Avenue between 143rd Street and 143rd
Place. Uses within this area are therefore restricted to small retail
businesses, offices and residential dwellings, all of which must be
compatible in scale and ambiance with the district (see Map 1). The
Certificate of Appropriateness review process was designed to ensure all
development in the district meets these objectives.



B.   Uses.



   The following uses may be established in the OOH District in accordance
with the procedures and standards set forth in Section 5-101 through 5-104
for permitted uses and Section 5-105 for special uses in the Land Development
Code. Although certain uses are listed as "permitted uses" within the
district, a Certificate of Appropriateness must still be obtained, as
described later in this section, and any other required development approval
from the Village prior to construction, alteration or demolition. "Special
Uses" must obtain a special use permit as well as any other required
development approvals from the Village.



   The following applies to redevelopment in the Old Orland Historic
District:



   In the non-commercial areas, existing residential buildings cannot be
converted to mixed use buildings, or be used for office or commercial uses;



   In the commercial areas, mixed use and single use commercial/ office
buildings can replace existing residential buildings via a tear-down when a
parcel is redeveloped, but require a special use permit.



   In the commercial areas, mixed use and single use commercial/ office
uses are permitted in existing residential buildings as a permitted use.

C.   Bulk Requirements.



   The following requirements apply to all properties in the OOH District.



   1.   Lot Area and Width.



   The minimum lot area for each residential dwelling unit shall be 2,500
square feet. The minimum front lot width shall be twenty-five (25) feet,
adding ten (10) feet for a corner lot, to a maximum of 50 feet for new
construction. The minimum lot area for each nonresidential or mixed use
development shall be 5,000 square feet. The minimum front lot width shall be
fifty (50) feet, adding ten (10) feet for a corner lot, to a maximum of 125
feet for new construction.



   2.   Height.



   The maximum building height in the Historic District is 37 feet to the
top of the structure.



   3.   Lot Coverage.



   For all residential developments, no more than 80% of the area of the
lot may be impervious. The remaining 20% must be maintained as green space.
For all non-residential or mixed use developments, at least 10% of the site
shall be maintained as green space.



   4.   Building Setbacks.



   The following setback standards shall apply in the OOH District. For
square corner lots, the "front" setback shall be considered to be the yard
where the main door is located; the other yard shall therefore be considered
to be the "side" setback.



      a.   Residential:



         1.   Front:   Eight (8) foot minimum and fifteen (15)
foot maximum.  The minimum may be reduced to the average of the front
setback of the two adjacent lots if one or both of  the setbacks of adjacent
lots are smaller.



         2.   Side:   Five (5) foot minimum and fifteen (15)
foot maximum.



         3.   Corner Side:   Ten (10) foot minimum and no
maximum.



         4.   Rear:   Thirty (30) foot minimum and no maximum.



      b.   Non-Residential and Mixed Use:



         1.   Front:   No minimum and five (5) foot maximum.



         2.   Side:   No minimum and five (5) foot maximum.



         3.   Corner Side:   Ten (10) foot minimum and no
maximum.



         4.   Rear:   Twenty (20) foot minimum and no maximum.



D.   Other Regulations.



   1.   Permitted Uses in the Right-of-Way and Setback Areas.



      Pedestrian oriented uses are allowed within the public
right-of-way and in setback areas, including sidewalks, canopies, marquees,
benches, projecting signs and landscaped gardens. No parking shall be
permitted in the front setback for any use located in the OOH District.



   2.   Parking Lot Setbacks.



      For existing lots, if there is insufficient area to provide a
landscape buffer between the parking lot and sidewalk, a three (3) foot high
decorative fence or a two (2) foot high masonry seating wall should be
provided to separate the sidewalk from the parking area.



   3.   Parking Requirements.



      All parking regulations apply as outlined in Section 6-306 of the
Land Development Code. If there is insufficient area for Historic District
businesses in new or existing buildings to provide required parking on-site,
parking opportunities demonstrated to exist either on-street or via shared
parking nearby may be applied to meet the requirement. (Ord. 4738, 6/18/12)



   4.   Loading.



      All loading regulations apply as outlined in Section 6-306 of the
Land Development Code. For businesses in the Historic District that do not
have sufficient land area on site to provide a designated loading space,
loading may occur from a side street, from an alleyway or in a parking lot
drive aisle, provided loading activities do not disrupt traffic flow for
other uses.



   5.   Landscaping.



      Buffer landscaping between like uses and between commercial uses
and the street is not required in the Old Orland Historic District. All other
landscaping regulations apply as outlined in Section 6-305 of the Land
Development Code. If there is insufficient area to provide required
landscaping on-site, petitioners are encouraged to provide landscape
improvements in areas visible from the street, including movable benches,
decorative planter boxes, hanging baskets et cetera. It is the responsibility
of the property owner to maintain these improvements.



   6.   Tree Preservation.



      Tree preservation requirements outlined in Section 6-305
Landscape and Tree Preservation of the Land Development Code for preserving
and/or removing trees 4-inches in caliper and above apply to the OOH
District. All healthy mature trees that contribute to the character of the
Historic District should be maintained. (Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16)



   7.   Fences.



      For front yards and yards abutting a street, fences shall not
exceed a height of 4-feet, must be 50% open, and be of picket construction.
All other fences shall not exceed a height of 5-feet. Chain link fences are
not permitted. Fences on property with contributing structures shall be of
wood construction. Fencing on property with non-contributing structures or
new construction can be vinyl. (Ord. 4738, 6/18/12)



   8.   Garages.



      New construction should continue the tradition of locating the
garage at the rear of the lot, behind the principal building. Garages should
be compatible in design, materials and roof form of the principal building.
The maximum height permitted for a garage is sixteen (16) feet to the top of
the structure. Additional height may be permitted for a specific roof form
that reflects the principal building. Attached garages are allowed only on
corner lots and only when mitigating for natural features such as topography
or heritage trees.  No living space is allowed above an attached garage. 
Attached garages must be built to a similar scale as detached garages,
located at the rear of the principal building and maintain ornamental
overhead doors when facing the right-of-way.  Garages may have a maximum of
two overhead doors or, when located on corner lots, three overhead doors and
they must be ornamental doors when facing the right-of-way.  (Amd. Ord.
4839, 9/16/13)



E.   Signage.



   Signs in the OOH District shall be compatible with the architecture,
scale and design of the building of which it is a part. Signs should not
obscure or overwhelm architectural details. Building directories are
encouraged for multi-tenanted buildings.



   1.   Flat Wall Signs.



   Only one (1) sign shall be permitted per lot frontage on a public
right-of-way. The maximum sign area shall be 7.5% of the area of the first
two (2) stories of building elevation on which it is placed, or for a
multi-tenant retail commercial building, each tenant may have a sign area not
to exceed 7.5% of the area of its leased exterior storefront. Wall signs may
not cover any part of a window or extend above the roof line.



   2.   Canopies or Awnings.



   Canopies or awnings are considered to be wall signs and must be opaque
and made of fabric. Lettering should be confined to the area of the awning
perpendicular to the sidewalk. Avoid lettering on slants and curves.
Lettering must not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total canopy or awning
area, subject to the other wall sign limitations, and be limited to placement
above windows and doors.



   3.   Projecting Signs.



   Projecting signs cannot extend more than 3-feet into the public
right-of-way. The bottom of the sign must be at least 7-feet from the ground.
The maximum size of such sign shall be ten (10) square feet. Such signs shall
not be internally illuminated.



   4.   Window Signs.



   Window signs may cover no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the window
area and lettering shall be painted. Sign area shall be calculated by drawing
a box around each word.



   5.   Freestanding Signs.



   Permanent freestanding signs shall only be permitted on lots forty (40)
or more feet in width. The maximum sign face area shall be twenty (20) square
feet with a maximum height of five (5) feet. Message boards are not permitted.







Wall and Window Signs







Signage Examples:



1. Window Signs



2. Wall Signs



3. Canopy Signs



4. Projection Signs







Freestanding Sign



F.   Architectural Design Standards.



   1.   Applicability.



   There are sixteen (16) buildings designated as "Contributing
Structures" in Old Orland, two of which are listed on the National Register
of Historic Places. These buildings are identified in Map 1 of this section.
(While not in the District, Building 1 is considered a contributing structure
and should be protected). Remaining buildings in the OOH District are
classified as "Non-Contributing" or "New Construction".



      a.   Buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.
Buildings listed on the  National Register of Historic Places must comply
with the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and design standards  outlined in this section to maintain
and improve the accuracy and integrity of the interior and exterior of the
building. These are eligible for matching funds from the Façade Improvement
Program.



      b.   All Contributing Structures and Additions to Contributing
Structures. All  Contributing structures and additions to Contributing
Structures must comply with the Design Standards outlined in this section in
order to maintain and improve the accuracy and integrity of the exterior of
the building only. These are  eligible for matching funds from the Façade
Improvement Program.



      c.   All Non-Contributing Structures, Additions to
Non-Contributing Structures  and New Construction. All Non-Contributing
Structures, additions to Non- Contributing Structures and New Construction
are strongly encouraged to follow the Design Standards outlined in this
section. If the Design Standards are met, these structures may be eligible
for Low Interest Loans and matching funds from the Façade Improvement
Program.



   2.   General Design Standards.



      The following are based both on the United States Secretary of
the Interior's Standardsfor Rehabilitation and on local preservation
objectives for the OOH District. These standards will be used to evaluate
applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.



      a.   Compatible Use with Minimal Alterations. Every reasonable
effort shall be made to use a property for its originally intended purpose or
to provide a compatible use for a property which requires minimal alteration
of the building, structure, or site and its environment.



      b.   Relationship to Streets and Open Spaces. The unique
character of streets and open spaces in the Historic District shall be
retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alterations of
features and spaces that characterize a property and contribute to the
character of the Historic District should be avoided.



      c.   Distinctive Architectural Features. The distinguishing
original qualities or character of the District including buildings,
structures or sites and their environment shall not be destroyed. Avoid the
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features. Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be preserved.



      d.   Historic Appropriateness. All buildings, structures and
sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Avoid alterations
that have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance.



      e.   Past Alterations. Changes that have taken place in the
course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building,
structure or site and its  environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized
and respected.



      f.   Deteriorated Architectural Features. These shall be
repaired rather than replaced. If the severity of deterioration requires
replacement, new material should match the historic material being replaced
in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence than on conjectural designs or availability or architectural
elements on other buildings or structures.



      g.   Chemical of Physical Treatment. Chemical or physical
treatment, such as  sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. Surface cleaning or structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible.



      h.   Archaeological Resources. Every reasonable effort shall
be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by or
adjacent to any project.



      i.   Contemporary Design. Contemporary design for alterations
and additions to existing buildings and construction of new buildings within
the District shall not be discouraged when such alterations and new
construction do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural
material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color,
material, and character of the property and the District.



      j.   Structural Integrity. Wherever possible, new additions or
alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such
additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired.



      k.   Replacement of Existing Features. Architectural elements
shall be repaired with original materials rather than replaced. Replacement
should be considered only when features have severely deteriorated. New
material should match the existing material. If the material being replaced
is not original to the structure, original materials shall be used to improve
the overall integrity of the structure.



      l.   Additions and New Construction. Appropriate locations of
an addition are at the rear or sides of the building. These should be
connected to the property in a way that does not alter, obscure, damage, or
destroy any significant features, and has a minimal impact on the exterior
walls. Additions should complement the original building in size, scale,
massing and design. These should not be taller or wider than the original
building. Design features including the roof shape, materials, color,
location of windows and doors, cornice heights et cetera should be consistent
with the original building.



   New construction should be compatible with the architectural styles of
the District. Replication of a specific architectural style can create a
false historic appearance and should be avoided. Contemporary designs are
acceptable when compatible in size, scale, color, material , and character of
the District.



   Building additions and new construction are encouraged to be compatible
with the proportions predominant in the District: rectangular, vertically
oriented massing with gable ends facing the street.



   3.   Specific Design Standards.



      a.   Windows.



         1.   Replacement Windows. Use wood windows, specifically
on the front facades. Metal windows can be used for secondary facades if they
are painted to match wood windows. Retain the location and size of original
window openings. Retain or simplify divisions of glass, and retain transoms.



         2.   New Windows. Simple double-hung wood windows with
vertical proportions are appropriate for the District. Wood is preferred; if
metal is used, it should be painted to match any existing windows



         3.   Storm Windows and/or Screens. Painted wood is
preferred. Painted metal may be used for additions. The division in the storm
window should align with the divisions of the window.



         4.   Shutters. Avoid using shutters unless they were
original to the building. If shutters are used, they should be half the width
of the window opening and be hinged rather than screwed to the siding.



         5.   Sashes. Wood sashes are preferred. Clad wood and
painted metal may be used for additions. Sash can have either single light or
multiple divided lights. Storm windows and screens of wood or painted metal
with divisions in alignment of the divisions of the window.



         6.   Not Permitted.



            i.   Dividing each sash into more than six lights;



            ii.   Synthetic trim to cover existing trim and
synthetic siding which conceals the original wood window frame;



            iii.   Glass block windows;



            iv.   Horizontally proportioned windows;



            v.   Snap-in-muntins and applied muntins;



            vi.   High-gloss metal finishes;



            vii.   Unique contemporary shapes or casements;



            viii.   Mirrored, reflective or tinted glass.



Predominant Style



Wood, double hung sash windows, with both single and multiple divided lights
are common in the historic buildings. The most common light configuration is
a simple one-over-one.



Some buildings have ornamental Queen Anne windows with large lower sash and
leaded or stained glass fixed sash above. Queen Anne windows have been
identified in Folk Victorian, Queen Anne and National style houses.







 



      b.   Exterior Doors.



         1.   Replacement Doors. Use wood doors, specifically on
the front facades. Metal doors can be used for secondary facades if they are
painted to match wood doors.



         2.   New Doors. Doors should be wood with the
appropriate paneling to the architectural style with transoms or lights in
the door as appropriate.



         3.   Storm Doors or Screen Doors. Should be wood with
full size screen or glass, or paneled lower half with screen or rectangular
glass light above. Any metal should be painted.



         4.   Not Permitted.



            i.   Metal doors with embossed paneling;



            ii.   Doors with large oval glass light;



            iii.   Six panel Colonial style doors and
contemporary flush doors;



            iv.   High-gloss metal storm doors and storm doors
with a flush  lower panel;



            v.   Sidelights are generally not typical on
residential buildings.



Predominant Style



Typically the historic houses in the District had wood doors of four or five
panels.



Large glass lights in doors are not typical in the District.



There are examples of wood paneled doors with vertically oriented, divided
lights in the upper panels of the door.



Sidelights on residential buildings are not typical for the District but are
seen on a few commercial buildings.



Transoms above front doors are seen throughout the District, although many
have been obscured with plywood or siding.







 



      c.   Porches and Door Overhangs.



      Wood porches and door overhangs are very common in the District.
These add greatly to the pedestrian scale and character of the street
facades, and are strongly encouraged for all new construction.



         1.   Existing Porches and Overhangs. Existing porches
and overhangs should be maintained. If replacement is necessary, wood
components and wood siding closely matching the original style should be used.



         2.   New Porches and Door Overhangs. New porches and
over hangs are encouraged for all additions and new buildings. Wood
components and wood siding are appropriate and should be painted. Porches on
additions or new construction are encouraged to be open and of a compatible
scale and material. If new porches are enclosed, these should be screened or
have double-hung windows. Front door overhangs with wall braces are
appropriate.



         3.   Not Permitted.



            i.   Enclosing an existing porch detracts from the
character of the main facades. Original porches have to remain open and
should not be enclosed;



            ii.   Removing or concealing distinctive porch
features when installing screens or windows;



            iii.   Re-cladding porches with synthetic siding;



            iv.   Eliminating significant detailing on porches;



            v.   Two story porches or overhangs, mansard roof



            Elements, and overhangs without vertical supports.



Predominant Style



Porches and door overhangs are typical of many of the existing buildings in
the District.



Existing porches are of wood, with stone or brick piers or foundations.



Detailing for the porches vary with architectural style.



Front door overhangs are also seen in the District, which are typically
supported by wall braces.







 



      d.   Exterior Stairs.



         As the uses of buildings have changed, several buildings
have been modified to add exterior stairs to the upper floor. Exterior stairs
are inconsistent with the character of the District and are generally
discouraged in the District.



         For existing buildings or additions, if exterior stairs to
the upper floor have to be provided, these should be:



         1.   Located to the rear of the building where possible.



         2.   Painted to match the color of the building and
screened from view.



         3.   For new construction, exterior stairs are not
allowed.



Predominant Style



Exterior stairs are not part of the typical historic vocabulary of the
District, and are more common with later additions or modifications.



      e.   Roofs, Skylights, Gutters and Chimneys.



         Replacement roofing, gutters and chimneys should match the
historic in the existing building in material and configuration, or should be
compatible.



         1.   Roofs, Skylights, Gutters and Chimneys. New or
replacement roofs of wood or asphalt shingles are appropriate. Wood shingles
should be machine cut. Asphalt shingles should be simple, flat and smooth,
and in an appropriate color. Painted metal roofs in terne coated steel is
allowed.



         Skylights are not permitted on Contributing Structures as
they are historically inappropriate. Skylights are acceptable on
non-contributing structures provided that these have the appropriate scale;
however, skylights with convex or bubble shapes, or other unusual
contemporary shapes should be avoided.



         Gutters were typically half round in profile. Gutters
should be of a compatible profile; compatible material includes painted metal.



         For new or replacement chimneys, brick chimneys with a
simple profile should be used. Brick and original profiles should be matched
if possible for replacements.



         2.   Not Permitted.



            i.   For new and replacement roofs, the following
should be avoided: hand split wood shakes, asphalt shingles with rough, thick
texture made to replicate shakes, clay or synthetic tile, slate, synthetic
slate and asphalt shingles in the color of new wood.



            ii.   Existing brick chimneys should not be clad
in siding or stucco.



Predominant Style



Original roofs were covered in wood shingles or painted tin sheathing.



Today, many of these roofs have been replaced with asphalt shingles.



Gutters were typically half round in profile on the original buildings.



Most buildings in the District have simple brick chimneys.



      f.   Siding, Brick and Trim.



         Narrow wood clapboard siding with painted wood trim is
appropriate for the District. Brick is not typical and can be found in some
commercial buildings. Original siding should be uncovered where possible and
restored.



         For replacements or additions, materials for siding, brick
and trim should match and be compatible in character, color and texture with
the original.



         1.   Siding. Narrow wood clapboard siding with 4-inch
exposure or wide wood clapboard siding with 8-inch exposure is appropriate
for the District. Light paint colors should be used for the siding that will
not conceal the shadow lines of the narrow clapboards and the decorative
trim. (Amd. Ord. 4839  9/16/13)



         2.   Brick. There are some examples of contributing
commercial  buildings with brick facades. These brick buildings often have
sills, lintels and upper level ornament of brick or limestone. Brick should
be used in limited amounts for replacement or additions to masonry buildings.
Where used, this should match the original in size, texture, color and
variation.



         3.   Trim. Painted wood trim is preferred, with simple
flat trim for doors and windows.



         4.   Not Permitted.



            i.   Synthetic sidings on Contributing Structures
as they are not historically appropriate. For non-contributing structures,
synthetic siding such as aluminum or vinyl are discouraged;



            ii.   Re-pointing with mortar matched to the brick
rather than to the original mortar;



            iii.   Applying mortar beyond the joints onto the
face of the brick or stone itself;



            iv.   Stucco facades;



            v.   Concealing decorative trim with synthetic
siding and trim;



            vi.   Removing original decorative trim elements
or replacing them with profiles of another style;



            vii.   Detailing with trim inappropriate to the
historic style of the building;



            viii.   Sandblasting or abrasive treatments;



            ix.   Stone facing materials and concrete blocks.



Predominant Style



The wood frame buildings were typically sided with horizontal wood clapboard.



Many of these buildings are now sided with composition board, asbestos board,
rough sawn plywood siding, or synthetic (aluminum or vinyl) siding.



Wood trim is generally found on the cornices, porches, door and window frames.



Except for early 20th Century commercial buildings, brick facades are not
typical of most of the older buildings in the District.



      g.   Storefronts.



      Storefronts are a significant architectural feature of historic
commercial buildings and their preservation is an important strategy for
retaining and preserving the character of commercial buildings in the
District.



      General design guidelines for windows, doors, roofs, chimneys,
gutters, porches, materials et cetera as outlined in previous sections will
apply to storefront designs in the District. The following specific
guidelines for storefronts will also apply.



         1.   All Storefronts. All storefronts should be
compatible in design, size, scale, color, material and character of the
historic elements of each building. Changes should reflect the building's
architecture based on evidence of the original. Important elements of
storefronts include: display windows and transoms, entrance and awning.



         2.   For a Commercial Building with an Existing
Storefront. For a storefront that is original or typical of the time period,
it should be retained and restored if needed. For a storefront that is
non-original or non-typical of the time period, rehabilitation is
recommended. If no historic evidence exists, storefront features shall be
compatible with other original storefronts in the District.



         3.   For New Commercial Buildings with Storefronts.
Incorporate a design compatible with the size and scale of the existing
storefronts.



         4.   For Conversions from Residential to Commercial. The
original windows should be retained without modifying openings. All work on
these buildings should refer to the design  guidelines in this section.



         5.   Storefront Windows and Entrances. Entrances should
be located based on historic precedent and recessed from the storefront.
Storefront windows should be of clear and transparent glass. If a lower
ceiling is desired in the interior, the  dropped ceiling should maintain at
least a 24-inch setback from the façade of the storefront to maintain the
visual integrity of the display windows and transoms.



         6.   Not Permitted.



            i.   Removal of original storefronts;



            ii.   Introduction of contemporary storefronts
with large expanses of glass, glass block, or high-gloss metal frames.



            iii.   Imitations of earlier historical styles
with mansard roofs, wood shakes, inoperable shutters, coach lanterns or
Colonial type multiple lights.



            iv.   Construction that includes interior dropped
ceilings that block the storefront windows or door.







 



Predominant Style



The Old Orland Historic District has three commercial building types:
Commercial Vernacular or Storefront, 20th Century Commercial, and residential
buildings converted to commercial uses.



The Storefront type is characterized by a false front façade, which is a
front wall that extends above the roof and/or beyond the sides of the
building to create a more imposing façade. The typically gabled roof can be
seen behind the cornice of the false front. In the District, these buildings
are of wood. The facades are sited at the lot line and are composed of a
storefront at ground level, and an upper story that is topped with a cornice
or parapet. These buildings often have decorative features in the Italianate
style.







 







 



20th Century Commercial buildings are also defined by their form but are
typically masonry with storefront at  ground level and an upper story that
is topped with a cornice. These buildings may also have decorative features
of other architectural styles. In the District, these buildings are of brick
with stone decorative details and have a flat roof typically hidden behind a
low parapet wall.



Commercial buildings converted from an original residential use should
respect the design, character and scale of the original buildings.

   G.   Review Process for Certificate of Appropriateness.



   The Certificate of Appropriateness review process is designed to
protect historic properties from insensitive or non-conforming alterations
and to ensure new buildings are compatible in design with older buildings in
the Old Orland Historic District.  The process for Certificates or
Appropriateness is outlined in Section 5-101 of the Land Development Code
(5-101.C and 5-101.D) and shall follow the requirements outlined in Section
5-110 of the Land Development Code pertaining to Landmarks.  (Ord. 5312 
7/16/18)



   The tables below outline the Certificate of Appropriateness review and
approval process for the three categories of buildings in the OOH District
and landmarks and are followed by descriptions of the terms used. Once the
required review and approval is obtained, building permits must be procured
from the Village before the proposed work begins.

SECTION 6-210.   COR MIXED USE DISTRICT.



   A.   Purpose.  The COR Mixed Use District is established to
encourage and promote a mix of commercial, office and residential uses and to
create a Village core.  It is the purpose of this district to permit the
clustering of relatively dense development in an effort to create an
integrated setting and reduce automobile dependency. The district therefore
provides for flexibility in the design of pedestrian-oriented development and
in the location of employment and retail centers in proximity to higher
density housing. The district is also designed to provide for the development
of a variety of retail and commercial services that may change over time in
response to market conditions. The location and design of such development is
intended to provide efficiently located and diverse shopping and service
opportunities.



   B.   Permitted Uses. The following uses may be established as
permitted uses in the COR Mixed Use District in buildings up to 50,000 square
feet unless otherwise limited below in accordance with the procedures set

STREET NAME
 
MINIMUM BUILDING SETBACK FROM STREET
 
PURPOSE OF THE SETBACK AREA




All streets, except as below
 
25 feet
 
For streets carrying moderate to high regional and local traffic, a setback
area of 25 feet will be required. This will allow commercial buildings to
maintain high visibility from the streets, and also provide a significant
landscaped area along the street.


Exceptions:
 
 
 
 


LaGrange Road
 
25 feet
 
LaGrange Road is proposed to be widened to a six lane arterial with a
landscaped median. This setback area will distinguish it from other arterials
as the main commercial area of the Village. The setback will allow
landscaping that will add a sense of scale, safety and enclosure to the
corridor, and help create a unique look for the street. (Amd. Ord. 4996 
6/15/15)


147th Street
 
15 feet
 
For pedestrian oriented streets that also carry moderate local traffic, a
setback area of 15 feet is required. This will encourage building entrances
to connect directly to the sidewalk, while allowing landscaping with low
plantings along the street.


Ravinia Avenue


West Avenue


144th Place


149th Street


157th Street
 
0 to 15 feet
 
These special pedestrian oriented streets shall be defined by buildings with
active street fronts, multiple entrances and well articulated street facades,
and by parkway trees along the sidewalk. Buildings shall be allowed to be
placed at the lot line or set back up to 15 feet to strengthen the pedestrian
character of the street.


142nd Street


Ravinia extension (north of 143rd Street and south of 159th Street)


161st Street


160th Street


95th Avenue




 



      2.   Building Setbacks from rear and side lot lines that do
not abut a street. All buildings must maintain a minimum of 30 feet of
setback area from the rear lot line and a minimum of 15 feet of setback area
from the side lot lines that do not abut a street.



      3.   Permitted Uses in Building Setback Areas along Streets.
Setback areas will be primarily used for landscaping and other pedestrian
oriented uses including:



         a.   Widened sidewalks and entranceways;



         b.   Plazas, outdoor gardens, patios and outdoor seating
areas;



         c.   Water features, including bioswales or other
stormwater management elements;



         d.   Public art or outdoor architectural features like
clock towers, pergolas etc.;



         e.   Pergolas and/or arbor structures;



         f.   Benches and complementary site furniture.



         The setback area can be expanded to accommodate the above
pedestrian oriented uses if needed. Architectural features that help to
create a stronger pedestrian scale can extend into the setback area up to 10
feet, including:



         g.   Canopies, marquees and other projections that
create shaded and protected entrances;



         h.   Extended roofs and eaves;



         i.   Awnings and canopies over windows;



         j.   Projecting blade signs that comply with the
Village's sign ordinance;



         k.   Tensile Canopies that project over outdoor
congregation areas.



(Amd. Ord. 5061  1/18/16; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      4.   Uses not Permitted in Building Setbacks along Streets.



         Parking lots or structures (exception cited below),
drive-through facilities, loading facilities or trash enclosures are not
allowed within the setback area between the building facade and the street.



         Drive through facilities in the setback area shall be
allowed via Special Use modification only, when there are no reasonable
alternatives. In order to qualify for a Special Use Modification, the drive
through facility must meet all of the following conditions:

constructed with decorative pavement or pervious pavers.  (Ord. 4610 
12/20/10)



         d.   Any order windows and menu boxes must be designed
to integrate into the architecture of the building and appear hidden' from
vehicular and pedestrian view.  All efforts should be made to keep the order
windows and menu boxes out of the setback between the building and the
street. 



            1.   Menu boxes must include masonry architectural
details, matching the materials and design of the building.



            2.   Menu boxes must be screened with landscaping
and/or masonry walls so they are not visible from the street.



            3.   Order windows must be designed with trim and
detail so they appear similar in appearance to other windows on the building.



         e.   The drop off area or drive aisle must be screened
with a combination of masonry walls and/or decorative landscaping in order to
provide a solid buffer at a minimum height of 36".



         f.   The drop off area or drive aisle shall not obstruct
any direct connections between the sidewalk along the street and the
entrances to the building and shall include crosswalks connection pedestrian
routes.



(Ord. 4535  1/18/10; Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)

area of the parcel may be covered with building, pavement and storm water
storage, leaving at least twenty-five percent (25%) of total parcel area in
green space. (See Section 2-102 Definitions "Green Space"). Impervious
coverage will be allowed up to 80% when Best Management Practices (BMP) such
as porous pavements and green roofs are used. Up to 40% of the BMPs will be
considered pervious, provided that the design standards outlined in the code
for BMPs are met.  (Ord. 4574  7/6/10)



   H.   Height. No structure may exceed six (6) stories or seventy-five
(75) feet, whichever is lower, and must be located 50 feet from adjacent

to integrate into the architecture of the building and appear hidden' from
vehicular and pedestrian view. All efforts should be made to keep the order
windows and menu boxes out of the setback between the building and the street.



            (1)   Menu boxes must include masonry
architectural details, matching the materials and design of the building.



            (2)   Menu boxes must be screened with landscaping
and/or masonry walls so they are not visible from the street.



            (3)   Order windows must be designed with trim and
detail so they appear similar in appearance to other windows on the building.



         e.   The drop off area or drive aisle must be screened
with a combination of masonry walls and/or decorative landscaping in order to
provide a solid buffer at a minimum height of 36".



         f.   The drop off area or drive aisle shall not obstruct
any direct connections between the sidewalk along the street and the
entrances to the building and shall include crosswalks connection pedestrian
routes.



(Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



      4.   Parking Lot Setbacks. A minimum of a 10-foot landscaped
setback must be provided between the parking lot and the primary street
right-of-way.



(Ord. 4769  12/3/12)



   G.   Lot Coverage. No more than seventy-five (75) percent of the
area of the parcel may be covered with building, pavement and storm water
storage, leaving at least twenty-five percent (25%) of total parcel area in
green space. (See Section 2-102 Definitions "Green Space").



      Impervious coverage will be allowed up to 80% when Best
Management Practices (BMP) such as porous pavements and green roofs are used.
Up to 40% of the BMPs will be considered pervious, provided that the design
standards outlined in the code for BMPs are met.  (Ord. 4374  6/2/08;
Amd. Ord. 4574 7/6/10)



   H.   Height. No building or structure may exceed six (6) stories or
seventy-five (75) feet, whichever is lower, except as provided as follows: 
Where a building is located within two hundred (200) feet of a residential
zoning district, the height of the building shall not exceed  1 ½  times
the average height of all buildings within the residential zoning district
which are located within two hundred (200) feet of the building. Where a
building is located more than six hundred (600) feet from a residential
zoning district, the height of a building or structure may be increased up to
twelve (12) stories through approval of a special use, upon consideration of
the impact on adjacent residential lots due to factors that include sunlight,
shade and privacy.



SECTION 6-212: VILLAGE CENTER DISTRICT (VCD)



(Entire Section Amended by Ord. 4137, 5/15/06)



   A.    Purpose and Vision.



   The mayor and the Village Board envision the Village Center District to
be the Downtown and Civic Core of Orland Park. From the Main Street Triangle
area around the 142nd Street train station to the Village Center Complex
along Ravinia Avenue, this unique district offers great potential to create
mixed use walkable neighborhoods in the heart of the Village. To ensure that
the district will create a unique pedestrian scale and civic character, the
Village offers the following vision for the area:



   The VCD District will offer a diverse mix of uses along intimate
pedestrian scaled streets and buildings within compact, walkable blocks.
Small-scale commercial uses will serve the district, and more residents will
be attracted to live within walking distance of the 142nd Street train
station. A fine grid of streets will connect the Village Center, the Downtown
area around the train station, the Orland Crossing area, the Public Library,
McGinnis Slough, Humphrey Woods, and the Old Orland Historic District. New
development on infill or vacant sites will strengthen the intimate character
of the area, and civic buildings and open spaces will continue to be key
focal points in the district.



      



 







 



Civic uses like the Metra Station, Library and Village Hall are the focal
points of the Village Center District.



   Map 1: Village Center District (VCD) Map Boundary







 



   B.    Development Principles.



   Land Development Codes for the Village Center District are based on the
following principles:



    Establish the Village Center District as the Downtown for the
Village by enhancing the prominence and setting of civic structures and
public open spaces;



    Continue the tradition established by the Village Center Complex by
encouraging buildings with strong architectural identities;



    Promote mixed-use buildings with ground floor retail and office or
residential uses above;



    Create attractive street facades with street level uses scaled and
oriented toward pedestrians;



    Create smaller walkable blocks that allow safe and attractive
pedestrian connections through the district;



    Create open space amenities as focal points of developments;



    Encourage continuous building frontage along the streets to reduce
the visual impacts of parking lots;



    Place parking lots at the rear of buildings away from pedestrian
oriented streets;



    Encourage alternative parking options, including on-street parking,
shared parking, parking below buildings, underground parking and parking
structures;



    Encourage buildings to provide dual entrances, allowing patrons to
enter both from the sidewalk along the street and the parking area at the
rear or side of buildings;



    Promote sustainable and environmentally responsible design;







   A wide variety of uses in a small scale setting is one of the major
assets of the Village Center District.



   C.   Uses.



      1.   Introduction.

(Amd. Ord. 5061  1/18/16; Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16; Amd. Ord. 5167 
2/20/17)



   D.   Bulk Requirements.



      1.   Lot Coverage.



   No more than seventy-five (75) percent of the area of the parcel may be
covered with building, pavement and storm water storage, leaving at least
twenty-five (25) percent of total parcel area in green space. (See Section
2-102 Definitions "Green Space"). Impervious coverage will be allowed up to
80% when Best Management Practices (BMP) such as porous pavements and green
roofs are used. Up to 40% of the BMPs will be considered pervious, provided
that the design standards outlined in the code for BMPs are met. (Ord. 4574,
7/6/10)



      2.   Lot Area and Lot Width.



   For detached dwelling units, minimum lot area shall be 2,500 square
feet, with a minimum lot width of 25 feet and a maximum lot width of 50 feet.
For commercial uses, the minimum lot area shall be 10,000 square feet, with a
minimum lot width of 80 feet.



      3.   Height.



      No building may exceed 3 stories, up to a maximum height of 40
feet, with the following exceptions:



         a.   Building footprints within 600 feet of the 142nd
Street train station may be up to 6 stories to a maximum height of 70 feet.



         b.   At intersections of public streets, or private
streets that are designed to public street standards with sidewalks and
parkways, corner buildings may be up to 4 stories tall to a maximum height of
55 feet.



         c.   Buildings cannot be more than two stories taller
than adjacent existing single family homes.



      4.   Land Use Intensity.



      Allowable square footage for all developments, including single
use commercial and single use residential, as well as mixed-use projects,
shall be measured by the Floor Area Ratio (FAR). All developments with
residential uses will be regulated on the basis of FAR compliance rather than
the number of residential units. The maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) will be
3.0 for developments within 1,000 feet of a mass transit facility and 1.0 for
developments outside of 1,000 feet of a mass transit facility. FAR will be
calculated by dividing the overall gross floor area by the gross site area.
Gross floor area includes all building residential square footage. Accessory
parking or transit facility parking is not included in the Gross Floor Area
for FAR calculations.



      5.   Parking.



      Large surface parking lots are not appropriate to the scale and
character of this district. To promote smaller lots, shared parking,
on-street parking and the shared use of public parking facilities, and
mixed-use developments will be allowed to reduce the on-site parking
requirements outlined in Section 6-306.B by up to 25%.



      6.   Setbacks.



         a.   Purpose of the setback requirements:



            1.   To create attractive and pedestrian oriented
streets with buildings and landscaping along the sidewalks; and



            2.   To minimize the visual impacts of surface
parking lots and drive-through facilities along streets by locating these to
the rear (preferred) or sides of buildings. If parking lots are located in
the side-yard, an enhanced landscaping buffer with pedestrian accommodation
and amenities must be provided. (Ord. 4210, 12/18/06)



         b.   Types of setbacks required:



            1.   Building setbacks from streets;



            2.   Building setbacks from lot lines not abutting
a street;



            3.   Parking lot setbacks from all lot lines;



         c.   Building setbacks from street right-of-ways:



   Setbacks between the street right-of-way and the building facade facing
the street shall follow the minimum requirements set in Table 6-212.D.6.c
below. The setback width is related to the width and character of the street.



 

Table 6-212.D.6.c: Building Setbacks from Street Right-of-Ways


STREET NAME
 
BUILDING SETBACK FROM STREET
 
PURPOSE OF THE SETBACK AREA


All streets carrying moderate to high auto traffic:
La Grange Road
143rd Street
John Humphrey Drive Ravinia Avenue (south of 143rd Street)
151st Street
Southwest Highway
 
15 feet minimum, provided that a 5 foot sidewalk and an 8 foot parkway is
maintained in the right-of-way;

For La Grange Road, 25 feet minimum from the future right-of-way south of
143rd Street;
 
For streets carrying moderate to high regional and local traffic, a setback
area of 15 feet will be required. This will allow commercial buildings to
maintain high visibility from the street, and also provide a significant
landscaped area along the street.


All other pedestrian oriented streets, including:
142nd Street
144th Place
147th Street
149th Place
Ravinia Avenue extension (north of 143rd Street)
West Avenue and
Any new internal street in the district
 
5-15 feet, provided that a 5 foot sidewalk and an 8 foot parkway is
maintained in the right-of-way; 0 (zero) lot line buildings will be allowed
without a parkway when the sidewalk is at least 10 feet wide, with room for
trees in grates;
 
These pedestrian oriented streets shall be defined by buildings with active
street fronts, multiple entrances and well articulated street facades, and by
parkway trees along the sidewalk. Buildings shall be allowed to be placed at
the lot line or set back up to 15 feet to strengthen the pedestrian character
of the street.



 



         d.   Building setbacks from rear and side lot lines that
do not abut a street:



         All buildings must maintain a minimum of 30 feet of setback
area from the rear lot line and a minimum of 15 feet of setback area from the
side lot lines that do not abut a street.



         e.   Parking lot setbacks:



         A minimum landscaped setback must be provided between the
parking lot and the primary street right-of-way that accommodates the
required landscape bufferyard area per Section 6-305. (Ord. 4792  2/4/13)



   E.   Design Standards.



      1.   Permitted Uses in Building Setback Areas along Streets.



      Setback areas will be primarily used for landscaping and other
pedestrian oriented uses including:



         a.   Widened sidewalks and entrance-ways;



         b.   Plazas, outdoor gardens, patios and outdoor seating
areas;



         c.   Water features, including bioswales or other
stormwater management elements;



         d.   Public art or outdoor architectural features like
clock towers, pergolas etc.



         e.   Pergolas and/or arbor structures;



         f.   Benches and complementary site furniture.



         The setback area can be expanded to accommodate the above
pedestrian oriented uses if needed. Architectural features that help to
create a stronger pedestrian scale can extend into the minimum required
setback area no closer than 5 feet from the right-of-way, including: (Ord.
4880  2/3/14)



         g.   Canopies, marquees and other projections that
create shaded and protected entrances;



         h.   Extended roofs and eaves, and awnings and canopies
over windows;



         i.   Projecting blade signs that comply with the
Village's sign ordinance;



         j.   Tensile Canopies that project over outdoor
congregation areas.



(Amd. Ord. 5061  1/18/16; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      2.   Uses Not Permitted in Building Setback Areas along
Streets.



      Parking lots or structures, drive-through facilities, loading
facilities or trash enclosures are not allowed within the setback area
between the building facade and the street. Drive-through facilities located
in the side-yard must provide an enhanced landscaping buffer with pedestrian
accommodation and amenities.



         Drop-off areas or drive-aisles are prohibited in the
setback between the building facade and the street. Drop-off areas or drive
aisles in the setback area are strongly



         discouraged and shall be allowed within the setback area
with a Variance only when there are no reasonable alternatives. The following
conditions shall be met if these uses are proposed in the setback area:



         a.   That these do not obstruct any direct connections
between the sidewalk along the street and the entrances to the building; and



         b.   That these are designed with special paving to
appear to be extensions of the sidewalk and instead of curbs, the drive-aisle
is differentiated with bollards, pavers etc. (Ord. 4210  12/18/06)



         c.   The drive through should be designed as a single
lane with a maximum with of 14' and a minimum turning radius of 20' from the
centerline of the drive aisle.



         d.   Drive through lanes must be a minimum of 10' from
all property lines.



         e.   The drop-off area or drive aisle must be
constructed with decorative pavement or pervious pavers.



         f.   Any order windows and menu boxes must be designed
to integrate into the architecture of the building and appear hidden' from
vehicular and pedestrian view.  All efforts should be made to keep the order
windows and menu boxes out of the setback between the building and the
street. 



            1.   Menu boxes must include masonry architectural
details, matching the materials and design of the building.



            2.   Menu boxes must be screened with landscaping
and/or masonry walls so they are not visible from the street.



            3.   Order windows must be designed with trim and
detail so they appear similar in appearance to other windows on the building.



         g.   The drop-off area or drive aisle must be screened
with a combination of masonry walls and/or decorative landscaping in order to
provide a solid buffer at a minimum height of 36".

SECTION 6-214.  REGIONAL MIXED-USE CAMPUS.



(Entire Section Ord. 5168  2/20/17)



   A.   Intent.



      These regulations for the Regional Mixed-Use Campus (RMC) are
intended to guide the development of a high-intensity, interrelated live /
work / learn / play district along Interstate 80 that emphasizes the
pedestrian experience and public gathering spaces, promotes the clustering of
various knowledge-based industries, respects the natural environment, and
establishes a physical form that engages visitors, employees and residents.



   B.   Applicability.



      The RMC District includes properties within the area loosely
bordered by LaGrange Road on the east, Interstate 80 to the south, 107th
Avenue to the west, and certain parcels on the north side of Orland Parkway.







   C.   Guiding Principles.



      1.   Places for People.



         For places to be well-used and well-loved, they must be
safe, comfortable, varied, and attractive for people.



      2.   Promote a Positive Image.



         Walkable mixed-use developments are attractive and
distinctive places that create a positive image for businesses, investors,
and residents. Developments within the RMC District shall strengthen this
positive image by shaping the public and private realm based upon the
overarching themes of innovation, accessibility, continuity, cooperation,
pedestrian amenities, and sustainability.



      3.   Cultivate the Public Realm.



         Plaza areas, entrances to buildings, and other gathering
places shall mark the origin and destination points of walking and bicycling
trips, and collectively define the shape and extent of a multi-modal
circulation system. Consistent landscaping, streetscape treatments, and
signage shall provide visual continuity throughout the District.



      4.   Lead with Sustainability.



         Compact mixed-use developments concentrate development
where the road, transit, and utility infrastructure can support it. Because
of its planned concentrated character, the RMC District shall be much more
energy efficient than the same amount of development built in a typical one-
and two-story, car-oriented style. Thus sustainability shall start at the
scale of the District - leveraging existing natural assets - and trickle down
and inform green tactics among the individual buildings. A system to award
the inclusion of such techniques should be considered.



      5.   Target Diverse Users of Varying Scales.



         Encourage and enable mixed-use, cluster development to
create active nodes of residential, office, retail, entertainment, advanced
manufacturing and other compatible uses. The aim is to foster a variety of
activity throughout the day and strengthen economic and knowledge spillover
among users of various scales and interests - ranging from established
corporations to start-ups. 



      6.   Promote Quality Urban Design & Architecture.



         Successful communities apply urban design principles to
orchestrate numerous physical and non-physical elements to create dynamic,
attractive places. This District shall use urban design methodologies to
enhance the inter-relationships between blocks, streets, open space, and
landscaping, and weave together different building forms and uses. Buildings
shall display a coherent and memorable aesthetic with coordinated design
details that create a consistent, attractive and welcoming built environment.



      7.   Incentivize Code Conformance.



         The Village shall reward those who strive to meet its
standards and regulations. Therefore, the length of review time and number of
meetings required to obtain project approval shall be based upon the degree
of conformance to this Code, with precise conformance resulting in a
relatively quick review process.



   D.   Development Objectives.



      1.   Interconnected Site Planning.



         Buildings shall be (1) located at the street edge and
clustered together with (2) shared parking facilities and (3) common amenity
space, including (4) regional stormwater detention facilities.



      2.   Life Between Buildings.



         The defining quality and character of the District shall be
the campus feel created through a network of (5) public plazas and open space
areas. The spaces between buildings shall flow together and provide visual
and physical connections for pedestrians.



      3.   Pedestrian Experience.



         Sidewalks and pathways are required to (6) connect the
street frontage to all front building entrances, parking areas, plazas, and
any other destination that generates pedestrian traffic.



      4.   Mix of Development Intensity.



         The vast majority of the District shall have no height
limit, thereby encouraging more intense development (7) appropriate next to
an interstate. Development of (8) low- and (9) medium-intensity structures
will be encouraged to co-locate and share common areas.



      5.   Target Knowledge-Based Industries.



         A broad spectrum of users are encouraged to congregate
within the District - office, retail, multi-family, entertainment, and
recreation - with a special emphasis on knowledge-intens ive sectors, such as
Class A office, research labs, advanced manufacturing (3D printing), and
business incubator facilities.











   E.   Process Overview.



      The following provides a concise overview of the general review
process.  The intent of this code is to reward those who strive to meet its
standards and regulations.  Therefore, the length of review time and number
of meetings required to obtain project approval shall be based upon the
degree of conformance to this Code, as determined by the Director of
Development Services.



      1.   Precise Conformance (Board Only).



         Site plan matches the development and redevelopment goals
of the Code, including use, site plan, massing, and architectural details. 
Proposal requires no variances and needs no special approvals. 



      2.   Moderate Conformance (Committee & Board Only).



         Site plan matches the spirit and intent of the Code, but
there are some qualitative differences that do not require a variance and
needs no special approvals.



      3.   Non-Conformance & Special Approvals (Full Process).



         Site plan does not meet the spirit or intent of the Code,
and/or requires a special approval, such as a Special Use Permit, map
amendment, and/or a variance.

SECTION 6-302.   ACCESSORY STRUCTURES AND USES.



   A.   General Requirements.  No land or structure shall be used,
developed, or occupied unless all accessory uses and structures conform to
all applicable requirements of these regulations. The remaining subsections
of this Section establish additional requirements and restrictions for
particular accessory uses and structures.  Any accessory use or structure
shall be required to obtain the same type of approval under Article 5 of
these regulations as the principal use would have to obtain.  Any accessory
use or structure may be approved in conjunction with approval of the
principal use.  No accessory use or structure shall be approved,
established, or constructed before the principal use is approved in
accordance with these regulations.



   B.   Accessory Dwellings.  An accessory dwelling shall be permitted
in any residential district in accordance with the requirements that
follow.  Except as provided for in Subsection 7, below, all accessory
dwellings shall be located within the primary dwelling.



      1.   The principal use of the lot shall be a detached dwelling.



      2.   No more than one (1) accessory dwelling shall be located
on a lot.



      3.   The accessory dwelling shall be owned by the same person
as the principal dwelling.



      4.   The accessory dwelling shall not be served by a driveway
that is separate from the driveway that serves the principal dwelling.



      5.   The accessory dwelling shall have a floor area no greater
than fifty (50) percent of the floor area of the principal dwelling.



      6.   If the entrance to the accessory dwelling is separate
from the entrance to the principal dwelling, then that entrance shall not
face any street on which the lot fronts.  (Ord. 2462 - 10/18/93)



      7.   If the dwelling will be in a separate accessory
structure, then that structure shall also serve as a garage for residents of

   H.   Storm Water Best Management Practices. (Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



      1.   Best Management Practices. The following list of best
management practices serves to encourage residents and businesses to employ
clean technologies for local water quality improvements and storm water
management. For more information on best management practices, contact the
Development Services Department and reference the most up to date Village of
Orland Park Storm Water Management Technical Guidance Manual (TGM).



      a.   Bio-Swale. A bio-swale is a shallow drainage conveyance
trench or shoulder with a gentle slope designed to slowly transport and treat
run-off. A swale looks similar to a ditch, but is slightly wider and may use
berms and/or check dams to promote settling and infiltration.



      b.   Flow-Through Planter. A flow-through planter is a
structure or container placed above or below ground and filled with gravel,
soil and vegetation. Run-off is temporarily stored above the soil and slowly
filters down. Water that is not absorbed by the soils or plants is collected
in a perforated pipe at the bottom of the planter and routed to a drain
system or network of planters. These are effective for compact sites, next to
building foundations or other locations where infiltration may be problematic
or soils are poor-draining. Flow-through planters are permitted for all
commercial sites.



      c.   Green Roof/ Eco-Roof. A green roof uses living plant
material as part of the roofing system. Green roofs generally include a
waterproof membrane, root barrier, thermal insulation, drainage system,
filter layer, growing medium and living plant material. The plants, roots,
and soil filters detain and absorb rainwater, slowing, cleansing and cooling
the run-off. Roof gardens can be either extensive (soil depths three to four
inches) or intensive (soil depths six inches or greater). Green roofs are
permitted in all zoning districts.



      d.   Infiltration Planters. An infiltration planter is a
structure or container with an open bottom that is filled with a layer of
soil and vegetation. Run-off is diverted into the planter and temporarily
stored above the soil before infiltrating down into existing soils. This can
be employed in space-limited sites where run-off is received by a piped inlet
or sheet-flow, such as parking lot islands, plazas and walkways. If the soil
does not drain well or infiltration is not desired, a perforated pipe
under-drain can connect to storm sewers or defined, stabilized discharge
point.



         Infiltration Trench. An infiltration trench is a shallow
trench filled with stone, sand or rock to create a small reservoir for
run-off until it infiltrates into the soil or is released slowly into a storm
drain system, usually over a period of several days. Underground infiltration
trenches are effective for compact sites with limited space. Trenches should
be covered with stone, grass and small plants or shrubs to better incorporate
into the urban landscape. Shallow, wide trenches (as opposed to narrow, deep
trenches) are best for removing pollutants.



         e.   Native Landscaping. See Section 6-305, Landscape
and Tree Preservation.  (Amd. Ord. 5061 - 1/18/16)



      f.   Permeable Pavers. A series of interlocking concrete
pavers that contain drainage voids for passing runoff to the sub-surface,
where the water is further conveyed through base materials into the ground or
storm drain system. Permeable pavers can be used in parking lots, private
roads, and private sidewalks where no chemicals or other hazardous materials
are used. In areas where soils do not drain freely, permeable pavement can be
used in combination with sub-surface storm drain systems.



      g.   Porous Pavement. Porous pavement is a mixed and placed
hard surface that allows water to infiltrate across the entire area. The
pavement is made without fine sand or small aggregate to create void spaces
that allow rain and snow melt to pass through to a bed of open-graded
aggregate beneath the pervious pavement. Storm water is then stored until it
infiltrates into the underlying soils. Permeable paving should not be used in
areas with the potential for high pollutant loads or high traffic/ high speed
because its load-bearing capacity is typically less than conventional
pavement.



      h.   Rain Barrels. Rain barrels are designed to collect storm
water from residential single family home and condominium rooftops and stored
for later irrigation and non-potable uses in buildings. Rain barrels that
contain up to 55 gallons are permitted in all zoning districts.



         1.   Setbacks. Rain barrels may project up to three (3')
feet beyond the established building side and rear yard setbacks.



      i.   Rain Garden (Bio-Retention). A rain garden is a shallow
depression that captures storm water run-off from roofs, driveways, streets
and parking lots allowing it to infiltrate into the soil. 



         These gardens typically utilize a modified soil mixture to
ensure that the gardens soak up the water within a two-day period. Many are
designed to have overflow outlet during heavy rainfall events. Rain gardens
may be planted with shrubs, perennials or native wildflowers and grasses to
increase infiltration and attract biodiversity. Rain gardens typically absorb
30% more storm water than conventional lawns. Rain gardens are permitted in
all zoning districts.



      j.   Storm Water Cisterns. Storm water cisterns are designed
to collect storm water runoff from non-residential and mixed-use rooftops and
stored for later irrigation and non-potable uses in buildings. Above ground
storm water cisterns that contain up to 10,000 gallons are permitted in the
LSPD, BIZ, COR, VC, ORI, MFG and R-4 zoning districts.



         1.   Height. Storm water cisterns may not extend beyond
the roofline of the building's height or 40 feet, whichever is lesser.



         2.   Setbacks. Storm water cisterns may project up to
ten (10') feet beyond the established building side and rear yard setbacks. A
cistern may not locate between the building and the right-of-way.



         3.   Appearance. Stor m water cistern colors must match
existing building colors and the system must be integrated as an
architectural feature.



      k.   Underground Storm Water Cistern/ Dry Well. An underground
storm water cistern/ dry well is a process where storm water run-off is
funneled into an underground rock-filled trench or vault, temporarily
detained and infiltrated back into the surrounding soils. Dry wells can
reduce the volume of storm water run-off generated by the roofs of
structures, a significant source of run-off volume that enters storm drain
systems (they can also potentially recharge local aquifers by diverting storm
water into the soils). Dry wells should be placed near areas that accumulate
standing water or receive rooftop run-off from gutter downspouts. They can be
manufactured, made by filling a trench with stone and gravel, or utilize a
perforated pipe made of concrete or plastic, and surrounded by gravel.

SECTION 6-303.   HOME BUSINESSES.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02)



   Home businesses are being regulated so as to ensure that nearby
residents retain enjoyment of their properties and retain their property
values.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02)



   A home business may be permitted, accessory to any dwelling unit,
provided that the following requirements are met: (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02)



   A.   The use may not be located in a detached accessory structure,
and may not require internal or external alteration of the dwelling, or
involve construction features or use of equipment not customarily used for
domestic or household purposes.



   B.   The home business must be incidental and secondary to the use
of the dwelling for dwelling purposes.  (Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02)



   C.   The use must be conducted entirely within the dwelling by
members of the family residing on the premises, and shall employ no more than
one (1) person who is not a resident of the dwelling unit.



   D.   The use shall not utilize mechanical, electrical, or other
equipment which produces noise, electrical or magnetic interference,
vibration, heat, glare, or other nuisances outside the dwelling unit.



   E.   The primary access to the use shall be from the primary
entrance to the dwelling unit.



   F.   The use shall occupy no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the total floor area of the dwelling unit, including the basement or cellar.



   G.   Operation of the use shall not be visible from any existing
dwelling on an adjacent lot and shall not change the essential residential
character of the principal use. 



   H.   No more than fifteen (15) vehicle trips by either customers,
delivery persons or employees may be made throughout a day to and from the

approve preliminary landscape plans whose makeup may not meet the specified
quantities stated herein, if such plans are clearly superior to what could be
achieved by using those minimum standards and are consistent with the
purposes of this Section, as determined by the Development Services
Department. (Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



      2.   Additional Landscaping.  The Board of Trustees may

      3.   Changes to Approved Landscape Plan.  Minor changes to an
approved landscape plan shall require approval by the Development Services
Department by way of an administrative appearance review. Minor changes are
acceptable where such revisions do not diminish the overall intent of the
approved landscape plan. Substantial changes to an approved landscape plan
shall require the re-initiation of the preliminary/final landscape plan
process outlined in Section 6-305.E.4. (Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



   D.   Landscape Zones.

areas adjacent to public streets shall follow the existing pattern of rear
yard screening, as determined by the Development Services Department.



               iv.   The location of plant materials and
fences shall be determined by the Development Services Department.



      4.   Landscape Bufferyards.



         a.   General.  Landscape bufferyards shall act as
physical and visual edges between the side and rear yards of adjacent
parcels. Depending on the type of required bufferyard, their intent is to
either unify or separate adjoining land uses. When the intent of a bufferyard
is for the unification of adjacent parcels, pedestrian and vehicular
cross-access between adjacent parcels is strongly encouraged, and may be
required by the Village.



            1.   Single-family residential developments
adjacent to single-family residential developments are exempt from bufferyard
requirements. Mixed-use developments which include single-family residential
units are not exempt from bufferyard requirements.



            2.   Bufferyards may remain in the ownership of
the owner of the lot, or they may be subjected to deed restrictions and
subsequently conveyed to a homeowners' association, provided that any such
conveyance adequately guarantees the protection and maintenance of the
bufferyards for the purposes of this Section.



         b.   Requirements.



            1.   A required bufferyard is determined by
cross-referencing the "proposed land use" with the appropriate "adjacent land
use" as detailed in Table 6-305.D.4.b (A)  Bufferyard Land Use Types.
There are only two (2) land use types: Residential and Non-Residential, as
described below. Specific bufferyard requirements are detailed in Table
6-305.D.4.b (B)  Bufferyard Types.If an adjacent parcel is vacant or
undeveloped, the appropriate bufferyard shall be based on the parcels land
use category as detailed in the Villages Comprehensive Plan. If more than
one bufferyard option is available, a petitioner may decide which type of
bufferyard to install.

            2.   Type 1 Landscape Bufferyard  (10). A
Type 1 Landscape Bufferyard is intended to act as a physical and visual seam
between adjacent parcels by unifying similar land uses using landscaping.
Movement between seams is facilitated and encouraged with cross streets,
pedestrian sidewalks, crosswalks and other amenities that give a positive
sense of ambiance and create a desire to move from one side to the other.
Minimum width for a Type 1 Landscape Bufferyard is ten (10) feet. Site
amenities and pedestrian and vehicular cross-access between adjacent parcels
is strongly encouraged, and may be required, where appropriate.



               a.   Site amenities can occupy any portion 
of the area within a Type 1 Landscape Bufferyard, subject to Development
Services Department approval. Examples of site amenities include, but are not
limited to:

Development Services Department.



            3.   Type 2 Landscape Bufferyard  (15). A
Type 2 Landscape Bufferyard is intended to act as a physical and visual
filter between adjacent parcels by separating dissimilar land uses using
landscaping. Minimum width for a Type 2 Landscape Bufferyard is fifteen (15)
feet. Vehicular cross-access between adjacent parcels is encouraged where
appropriate. Site amenities are not encouraged within Type 2 Landscape
Bufferyard.



            4.   Type 3 Landscape Bufferyard  (10 +
Fence). A Type 3 Landscape Bufferyard is intended to act as a physical and
visual filter between adjacent parcels by separating dissimilar land uses
utilizing both an opaque, minimum six (6) foot tall fence and required
landscaping. Minimum width for a Type 3 Landscape Bufferyard is ten (10)
feet. Site amenities are not encouraged in Type 3 Landscape Bufferyard.
Fences shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section 6-310 Fences.



         c.   Details.



            1.   If the area of a required bufferyard is
increased or decreased through a modification to the required width, the
required area coverage and planting requirements still apply based on the
original minimum required width. If the area of the bufferyard will not
accommodate the required number of plants, the same number of plants that
cannot be accommodated shall be relocated to other areas within the site.



            2.   Landscape bufferyards shall be located within
setbacks, except where landscape corridor requirements, easements, covenants,
natural or engineered drainage, natural features, approved property entrances
or exits, or required sight triangles require the bufferyard to be set back
from the property line.



            3.   Landscape bufferyards shall not contain any
development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to
meet the standards of this Section, unless approved by the Development
Services Department. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities
shall occur within the corridor unless approved by the Plan Commission at the
time of site plan approval.



            4.   A landscape bufferyard may be used for
passive recreation or for utility or drainage easements, if the utility
requirements and the bufferyard requirements are compatible, as determined by
Development Services Department. If approved by the Development Services
Department, stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) may also be located
within the bufferyard. For details see Section 6-302.H Storm Water Best
Management Practices.



            5.   Existing fences on adjacent properties may be
counted as a credit if such fences are in good condition, are constructed of
an opaque material, have a height of at least six (6) feet tall and meet all
other fence requirements as detailed in Section 6-310 Fences.



         d.   Bufferyard Fences, Walls, Berms and Hedges. 
Fences, walls, berms and/or hedges may be required to supplement required
Landscape Bufferyard requirements if the Development Services Department

landscape plan and the recommendation of the Development Services Department
and shall then approve or deny the preliminary landscape plan.



         e.   The Village Board of Trustees may also impose
conditions on the issuance of the preliminary landscape plan approval. These
conditions shall pertain to the external appearance of the development, and
may include additional landscaping, buffering, fencing or other exterior
treatment. These conditions shall be reflected on the approved final
landscape plan.



         f.   Upon approval of a preliminary landscape plan by
the Village Board, a final landscape plan shall be submitted to the
Development Services Department for review and final approval. The final
landscape plan shall reference and be in accord with a project's approved
final engineering plans, site plan and Village Board conditions, if
applicable.



         g.   The Development Services Department shall review,
or have reviewed, all final landscape plans. The Development Services
Department shall approve or deny all final landscape plans. (Amd. Ord. 5221
 9/18/17)



      5.   Criteria for Approval of Landscape Plans.



         a.   Design Guidelines.  The following design
guidelines shall be used to evaluate proposed landscaping plans:



            1.   Landscape improvements shall serve to
integrate the project to the site and surrounding context, with particular
sensitivity to the natural topography, watercourses, and existing vegetation.
Preservation of the existing landscape material and land forms should be
taken into account, particularly where mature trees are a part of the site.
Depending on the context, landscaping should either offer a visual and
physical connection or separation between land uses;



            2.   Landscaping shall be designed to have a
natural aesthetic while having proportion, balance, unity, variety of
species, and variety of color throughout the seasons, and shall be comprised
of associations of plants which have similar climate, water, soil, sun
exposure and maintenance needs;



            3.   The best professional practices of the
American Society of Landscape Architects, American Nursery & Landscape
Association, and Illinois Green Industry Association shall be followed. In
addition, guidelines proposed and referenced through the Sustainable Sites
Initiative shall be utilized;



            4.   Landscaping shall provide drifts and massing
of plants with varying texture, color and forms to offset the mass of a
building and to provide a visual relief to the straight lines of building
architecture, parking lots and other man-made features;



            5.   Landscaping shall reduce the intrusion of
headlights and other glare and shall provide a safety barrier between
vehicles and pedestrians. Landscape plantings shall be designed to
accommodate snow removal by providing appropriate setbacks and storage space;



            6.   Landscaping should screen the view of
utilities or mechanical equipment. Existing site features within a required
landscape zone which do not function to meet the standards of the required
landscape zone shall be screened from the view of other properties or
removed, as determined during review of a site plan or landscape plan;



            7.   If landscaping is used to screen service
yards, utility meters and hardware, overhead doors, mechanical equipment,
dumpster enclosures, and/or other potentially unattractive places from public
view, landscape materials shall be planted in a natural type configuration,
be equally effective in all seasons, and comply with Section 6-308.J
Screening;



            8.   Landscaping should shade seating, walking,
and outdoor activity areas, shield buildings from winter wind and summer sun
so as to conserve energy, and should not interfere with clear access to the
sun where solar energy collection is anticipated;



            9.   Landscaping should provide a natural habitat
for birds and other animal life, and should preserve existing natural
vegetation and other natural features (unless prohibited by building use and
other agency restrictions);



            10.   Landscapes should be designed to encourage
the minimum use of water, inorganic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides
in the development and long term maintenance of landscapes;



            11.   Irrigation systems may be required for
certain landscaped areas, as determined by a landscape architect. The need
for sprinkler irrigation systems shall be determined by the type of plant
material and the condition/growing medium that they are installed in. All
irrigation systems shall be designed to minimize the use of water;



            12.   All earth berm locations shall be reviewed
by the Village Engineer to determine how the berms shall relate to drainage
and public utilities. Berms shall not exceed a maximum slope of 3:1;



            13.   An appropriate sight triangle shall be
maintained at all intersections and entryways to negate the impact of visual
obstructions and shall comply with Section 6- 104.E Clear Sight Triangles at
Street Intersections; and



            14.   Nothing shall be planted or installed within
an underground or overhead utility easement or any other easement without the
consent of the Village and/or the appropriate utility.



      6.   Landscape Material Requirements.



         a.   Plant Sizes. Minimum sizes for plant materials for
all projects at time of installation shall be as follows:



            1.   Evergreen or deciduous shrubs: minimum
eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) inches in height, varieties normally
measured by spread shall be a minimum of twenty- four (24) inches in spread;



            2.   Deciduous shade trees: minimum two and
one-half (2.5) inches caliper, balled and burlapped (B&B), measured six (6)
inches above the ground, all shade trees shall have a central leader. Smaller
caliper trees (e.g. 1.5") are permitted in naturalized landscape areas, or as
determined by the Development Services Department;  (Amd. Ord. 5312 
7/16/18)



            3.   Ornamental trees: clump form shall be a
minimum six (6) feet in height or have a minimum trunk size of two inches (2)
caliper;



            4.   Evergreen trees: minimum six (6) feet in
height and (B&B) when installed; and



            5.   Ornamental grasses, perennials and climbing
vines shall be specified as a minimum container size of one (1) gallon unless
otherwise approved by the Development Services Department.

(Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



         b.   Plant Diversity.  Diversity among required plant
material is required for both visual interest and to reduce the chance of
losing a large population of plants due to disease.



            1.   Table 6-305.E.6.b (A)  Plant Diversity
Requirements details the necessary maximum and minimum percentage of plant
species diversity based on the total quantity of plant species per plant
type. Plant types include, but are not limited to, shade trees, evergreen
trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, perennials and ornamental grasses. Minor
deviations from plant diversity requirements may be permitted, as determined
by the Development Services Department.  (Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



               i.   For example, if a development requires
fifty (50) shade trees (i.e. plant type), no more than forty (40) percent
[i.e. twenty (20) trees] nor less than ten (10) percent [i.e. five (5) trees]
can be of any one (1) species, and there must be a minimum of five (5)
different tree species within the fifty (50) trees selected.



            2.   Native landscaping materials shall compromise
thirty percent (30%) of the total plant count for all projects, except for
trees and shrubs in naturalized landscapes, which should be one hundred
percent (100%) native plant material specific to the proposed areas soil,
hydrology, and ecosystem.



            3.   The overall number of trees and shrubs
required for a site shall be comprised of not less than thirty percent (30%)
evergreen, and seventy percent (70%) deciduous, plus or minus five percent
(5%).

^   Unless otherwise noted.




 



         c.   All other specifications shall conform to the
American Nursery & Landscape Association, and American Standard for
Nursery Stock (ANSIZ60.12014), as amended, published by the American
Association of Nurserymen at the time of installation, and the recommended
practices of the International Society of Arboriculture. (Amd. Ord. 5221 
9/18/17)



         d.   The Development Services Department shall be
notified in writing if a plant substitution is needed due to the lack of
availability during construction. The plant substitution shall have the same
essential characteristics of the board approved plan species. See Section
6-305.C.3 Changes to Approved Landscape Plan.



         e.   Existing trees and vegetation within a required
landscape zone which are deemed healthy based on a tree survey completed by a
certified arborist may be counted toward the total plant material
requirements. If existing trees and shrubs do not fully meet the standards
for the type of landscape zone required, additional vegetation shall be
planted.



         f.   Areas within landscape bufferyard or corridors not
planted with trees or shrubs must be maintained as live landscaping. The
clustering of trees and shrubs is encouraged in these areas. Only small
trees, small shrubs and flowers may be planted in raised containers.



         g.   The minimum depth of topsoil applied to new
residential subdivisions, commercial areas and parks shall be (6) inches. All
plant material shall be planted with a minimum of six (6) inches of organic
soil.



         h.   Organic mulch shall be installed under trees,
shrubs, and throughout planting beds to a recommended depth of three (3)
inches, in accordance with the recommended practices of the International
Society of Arboriculture. Mulch should be pulled away at least four (4)
inches away from the bases of trees and shrubs. Mulch should not be piled up
against the trunk of a tree (i.e. volcano mulching) and should extend
to the drip line of the trees branches. Colorized mulch is not permitted.
(Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



         i.   All sod shall be clean and reasonably free of
weeds, pests or diseases. Grass seed shall be in conformance with U.S.
Department of Agriculture rules and regulations and applicable Illinois state
seed laws. All dormant seeding will require the use of an erosion control
blanket (North American Green S150 or equal).



         j.   All plant material shall be installed free of
disease and in a manner than ensures the availability of sufficient soil and
water to sustain healthy growth, and shall be planted in a manner which is
not intrusive to utilities or pavement.



      7.   Time for Installation of Required Plantings.



         a.   All landscaping, including mulching and seeding
shall be completed in accordance with the approved landscape plan and site
plan prior to issuance of an occupancy permit and prior to release of any
letter of credit for the site. This shall apply to all types of developments.



         b.   The Village may issue a temporary occupancy permit
until June 1 of the following year if landscaping is delayed due to unusual
conditions, such as drought, ice, oversaturated soil (deep mud), or
inappropriate planting season for the planned species, unavailability of
plant species, or other circumstances beyond the petitioner's control. If the
developer has not posted a letter of credit that includes landscaping costs
for the property, the petitioner must provide the Village with a letter of
credit to ensure the installation of the remaining landscape material.



         c.   All parkway trees are required to be planted by
June 1 of the year following issuance of the occupancy permit for any single
family home.  Single-family detached dwellings shall complete all
landscaping, including grass, within one year of the date of issuance of a
temporary occupancy permit for that dwelling.



         d.   All bufferyard and common area landscaping for
residential developments shall be completed in accordance with the approved
site plan at the time that eighty percent (80%) of the development is
completed or within the next planting season following occupancy, whichever
comes first. If the development is built in phases, then the landscaping
shall be completed as eighty percent (80%) of each phase is completed or
within the next planting season following occupancy, whichever comes first.



         e.   The developer or property owner shall contact the
Development Services Department for a final landscape inspection upon
completion of landscape installation. The Development Services Department
shall notify the developer or property owner of any deficiencies.



   F.   Maintenance and Preservation.



      1.   General Maintenance Standards.



         a.   The plantings in any landscaped area must be
properly maintained in order for the landscaped area to fulfill the purposes
for which it was established. 



         b.   The obligation for continuous maintenance is
binding on the petitioner who received landscape plan approval, to any
subsequent property owner(s) or any other parties having a controlling
interest in the property. (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



         c.   Continuous maintenance includes, but is not limited
to, the removal of weeds; mowing; trimming; edging; cultivation; reseeding;
plant replacement; appropriate fertilization; spraying; control of pests,
insects and rodents by nontoxic methods whenever possible;
watering/irrigation and other operations necessary to assure normal plant
growth. The maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscaping materials
and barriers, including refuse disposal areas, walls, fences and other
amenities upon their acceptance is also included.



         d.   Continuous maintenance also includes all
requirements set forth in the Village of Orland Park Code of Ordinances,
Title 5, Chapter 7 Property Maintenance Code.



         e.   The replacement of any dead or dying plant
materials or plant materials supporting less than fifty percent (50%) healthy
leaf growth shall be replaced annually in compliance with the approved
landscape plan.



         f.   Areas of a parcel not covered by structures or
pavement shall be planted with live landscaping.



         g.   In the event that any vegetation or physical
element functioning to meet the standards of this Section is severely damaged
due to an unusual weather occurrence or natural catastrophe, the owner shall
have one (1) year or one (1) growing season, whichever is sooner, to replace
or replant.



         h.   Property owners are responsible to repair or
replace any and all areas damaged by seasonal snow removal to a condition
compliant with the approved landscape plan on file with the Village within
(1) year or one (1) growing season of the damage, whichever is sooner.



         i.   All landscape materials shall be protected from
damage by vehicles or pedestrians that could reduce the viability of the
plant materials. This includes maintaining landscape materials in a natural
manner that precludes shaping or over-pruning of plant materials.



         j.   A parkway shall be maintained by the adjacent
property owner unless an agreement for maintenance has been reached with the
Village. See Village of Orland Park Code of Ordinances Tree Management
Program, Title 3, Chapter 6 for additional parkway tree maintenance
requirements.



         k.   At the time a developer turns over a subdivision to
a homeowners association, the developer shall be responsible for replacing
all dead plant material which was planted within the prior two (2) years. If
a homeowner association has been responsible for maintenance during that
period for over one year, the developer shall not be responsible for
replacing poorly maintained plants. Examples of poor maintenance include over
pruning, excessive weeds, improper trimming, diseases from lack of attention,
cracking, leaning, or other problems associated with damage from snow plowing
and mowing.



      2.   Naturalized Landscaping Area Monitoring and Management
Standards. Naturalized landscaping areas need management on a regular basis
after installation. Naturalized landscaping areas are most often planted as
the landscape perimeter for a stormwater detention area, although not limited
to just these areas. Site specific conditions influence the type and
frequency of management needed. See Section 6-305.E.3.e for Letter of Credit
requirements for naturalized landscape areas.



         a.   Landscape Plan. A landscape plan shall be submitted
for all projects where naturalized landscaping is included. See Section
6-305.E Landscape Plan for landscape plan requirements.



         b.   Monitoring and Management Plan. A near and
long-term Monitoring and Management Plan (M&M Plan) is an integral component
to ensuring proper long-term management of naturalized landscapes. When
required, a Monitoring and Management Plan shall be submitted with a
corresponding landscape plan for Village review and approval and shall
coincide with the Maintenance Plan approved with a WMO Permit.



            1.   The Village document, commonly referred to as
Monitoring and Management Plan for Naturalized Vegetation Areas and
Detention Basins, as amended, shall be used as a template for the
completion of a Monitoring and Management Plan. Minor edits to this template
may be made by the petitioner; however, the final text of the Monitoring and
Management Plan shall be approved by the Development Services Department. The
following are minimum components of a Monitoring and Management Plan:



               i.   The names, addresses, contacts, and
telephone numbers of the owner(s).



               ii.   The names, addresses, contacts, and
telephone numbers of the party or parties legally responsible for operations
and maintenance.



               iii.   If long-term management will be
provided by a public agency, the Monitoring and Management Plan is to include
written documentation by the public agency that they will accept such
responsibility, including associated capital expenses.



               iv.   If long-term management will be
provided by a property owner, business or an association, the Monitoring and
Management Plan is to include a copy of the terms to demonstrate that the
agreement is recorded for all lots.



               v.   A description and/or plan drawing
indicating the location of permanent access (public and private), overland
flow paths, control structures, etc.



               vi.   A list and schedule indicating how and
when inspections and maintenance are to be performed, including both routine
and infrequent maintenance tasks.



               vii.   A list of general tasks or activities
that are prohibited within the basin (e.g., dumping of yard waste or debris;
replacement of approved vegetation with nonapproved materials;
construction or placement of structures; pesticide application, fertilizer
application, mowing other than for meeting specific management goals; etc.).



               viii.   Documentation of the estimated
routine and nonroutine expenses and dedicated source(s) of funding for
continued inspection, operation, and maintenance.



               ix.   A Homeowners Association (HOA) /
Business Owners Association (BOA) shall include language in the governing
documents authorizing for collection of fees for the naturalized landscape
maintenance and outlining the process by which corrective actions will be
taken and enforced.



               x.   Written acknowledgment that any
amendment to the covenants and restrictions that alters the site beyond the
original condition must have prior Village approval.



         c.   Single-Family Residential Naturalized Landscaping.
Single-family residential properties that include naturalized landscaping
areas that exceed twelve inches (12") in height are exempt from the letter of
credit requirements detailed in 6-305.E.3.e Letter of Credit, although a
Landscape Plan and an abridged Monitoring and Management Plan (M&M Plan) are
still required. The following conditions apply to naturalized landscaping on
single-family residential properties:



            1.   A property owner shall apply to the
Development Services Department and receive a written approval of the
landscape plan prior to the installation of the naturalized landscaping.



               i.   The application shall include a plat of
survey and a site plan of the single-family lot drawn to scale on a sheet not
less than eight and one-half inches by eleven inches (8½" × 11"), which
contains: the location of property lines; location of structures, fences,
existing drainage patterns, and paved areas; location of each natural
landscaping area; a list by scientific and common name of species intended to
be planted and maintained within each area; and the setback distance of each
naturalized landscape area that will be located near any property line. Any
proposed soil amendments and levels of shade and sunlight should also be
included on the plan.



            2.   An M&M Plan for the near- and long-term
maintenance of the naturalized landscape area shall be submitted for review
and approval.



               i.   The Village document, commonly referred
to as Monitoring and Management Plan for Naturalized Vegetation Areas on
Single Family Residential Properties, as amended, shall be used as a
template for the completion of a single-family residential naturalized
landscapeMonitoring and Management Plan. Minor edits to this template may be
made by the petitioner; however, the final text of the M&M Plan shall be
approved by the Development Services Department.



            3.   It shall be permitted to grow native plants
that exceed twelve inches (12") in height within a natural landscaping area,
including ferns, grasses, sedges, rushes, forbs, shrubs and trees, in lieu of
turf grass lawn in designed and managed natural landscape areas.



            4.   Natural landscaping shall be permitted in
rear or side yards only, and setback at a minimum of three (3) feet of any
property line. No setback shall be required where the natural landscaping is
separated from adjacent lots by fencing or continuous shrub of three (3) feet
or more in height, or where the natural landscape area abuts permitted
naturalized landscaping on an adjacent lot.



            5.   Naturalized landscaping may occupy a maximum
of thirty percent (30%) of the total existing open space within the side or
rear yards of a single-family residential property.



            6.   It is not the intent of this section to allow
vegetated areas to be unmanaged, overgrown, a health hazard or a breeding
ground for fauna known to create a safety or health hazard. Plant species
that are defined as noxious and/or invasive by the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, Midwest Invasive Plant Network, or Illinois Invasive
Species Council do not come within the protection of this section.



            7.   If the naturalized landscape installation
would affect natural drainage or involve earthwork or affect capacity of
neighboring retention or detention facilities, then a land development review
application shall be submitted as per the provisions of Title 5 of the
Villages Land Development Code.



            8.   Upon installation of a naturalized landscape
area, the site shall be inspected by a Village inspector or designee to
verify compliance with the approved landscape plan and proper maintenance of
the natural landscape area. After a successful inspection, the property owner
will be provided with a letter from the Village certifying that the
naturalized landscape has been inspected and meets the criteria of this
Section. Subsequent inspections shall be performed annually by the Village or
designee, or as determined by the Development Services Department.



            9.   Permission for single-family residential
natural landscaping may be revoked with cause, such as failure of the owners
to manage the areas or to respond to notices of creation of a nuisance or
violation of the weed control ordinance.



      3.   Tree Preservation Standards.



         a.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to
establish high preservation standards for all public and private properties
within the Village, protect the Villages natural qualities and heritage,
continue its reputation as an extension of the Forest Preserves, benefit the
public at large as an asset to the neighborhoods, and become a source of
identity and pride to the community. In addition to these high standards,
this preservation ordinance specifically strives to accomplish the following:



            1.   Prevent soil erosion and sedimentation;



            2.   Reduce storm water runoff, replenish
aquifers, and eliminate the costs associated with correcting the above;



            3.   Assist in the absorption of excess carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere;



            4.   Create a sound buffer to noise pollution;



            5.   Provide protection against natural elements
such as the sun, wind and rain;



            6.   Provide habitat for birds, which in turn,
assists in the control of insects;



            7.   Protect and increase property values; and



            8.   Conserve and enhance the Village's
environment, especially its natural setting, and to protect the habitat of
its existing wildlife.



         b.   Responsibility for Compliance.  The following
actions require tree removal permits. No Village official, unless the tree is
a safety hazard, shall issue a permit provided herein in violation of the
requirements of this Section.



            1.   The removal of any heritage tree, defined as
any healthy tree that is twenty-four (24) inches in diameter, or greater,
measured four (4) feet from the ground, from any lot, developed or
undeveloped;



            2.   The removal of any tree from a parkway;



            3.   The removal of any tree, in good or poor
condition, from a conservation or tree preservation easement. Easements are
legal recorded agreements tied to property most often shown on a plat of
survey and/or plat of subdivision;



            4.   The removal of any tree from utility owned
property or non- residential utility easement;



            5.   The removal of any tree from any property,
commercial, institutional, office, industrial or multifamily residential,
with an approved landscape plan. (Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



         c.   Fines.



            1.   Failure to obtain a tree removal permit prior
to removing trees will result in a fine of $200.00 per inch of tree caliper
that shall be levied against that entity primarily responsible for said tree
removal. Each subsequent act of unauthorized tree removal by the same entity
shall result in a fifty percent (50%) increase over the previous fine levy.
This is in addition to the required tree mitigation. Trees removed without a
tree removal permit must also be replaced per the replacement standards set
forth in Section 6-305.F.3.f Tree Replacement Standards.



            2.   Permits for the removal, relocation or
replacement of trees covered herein shall be obtained by submitting an
application, on a form prescribed by the Development Services Department,
pursuant to the standards set forth in this Section.



         d.   Tree Pruning.



            1.   Tree pruning, done in order to remove dead
branches or to 'limb up' the tree is permitted without a permit. If limbed
up, a tree should be pruned gradually so that an unbranched trunk of a tree
is never more than one-third (1/3) the total height of the tree.



            2.   Tree topping, or the removal of the tree
central leader, is not permitted on any parkway tree, heritage tree, or
conservation easement tree.



            3.   No more than twenty-five percent (25%) of a
single trees canopy shall be removed in any one (1) year.



            4.   All trees must be installed and trimmed to
ensure that branches shall not obstruct the view of any street intersection
and so that there shall be a clear space of eight (8) feet above the surface
of the street or sidewalk.



         e.   Tree Protection.



            1.   During the development of a property, or the
relocation/removal of permitted trees, the owner of the property shall be
responsible for the erection of any and all barriers or protective guards
necessary to protect any existing or installed vegetation from damage both
during and after construction.



            2.   Trees to be preserved during the development
of the property shall be protected during construction by a fence around the
drip line of each tree to prevent compaction of soil and other damage to the
tree by equipment or materials. No excess topsoil, construction materials,
debris, or chemicals are allowed within the protected drip line of each tree.
In addition, no parking of vehicles, on-site offices, or machinery is allowed
inside the protected dripline. All refueling, maintenance, lunch, break and
burning areas are to be located away from all protected trees.



            3.   Wherever a change of ground grading is
planned, the trees to be preserved shall be protected by a retaining wall,
placed at the drip-line so as to preserve the existing grade for the roots.



            4.   Wherever a change of grading is planned, the
topsoil shall be preserved for the new landscaping to be installed.



            5.   When trenching alongside existing trees is
unavoidable, the trench must be one (1) foot for every one (1) inch tree
caliper, as measured four (4) feet above grade, away from the base of the
existing tree to be preserved.



            6.   Construction pruning and root pruning of
trees directly impacted by construction may be required for preservation of
existing trees. These measures must be indicated on the tree preservation
plan or the submitted application for permit.



         f.   Tree Replacement Standards.



            1.   Size.  All trees that are four (4) inches in
diameter, measured four (4') feet from the ground shall be replaced as
detailed in Table 6-305.F.3.f.1 (A) - Native Illinois Tree Replacement
Standards or Table 6-305.F.3.f.1 (B) - Non-Native Illinois Tree Replacement
Standards pursuant to Village approval.

            3.   Trees with a condition rated as 'Poor' or
'Dead' on a tree survey completed by a certified arborist are also exempt
from mitigation requirements.



            4.   The owner of a site with landscaping that is
unhealthful (i.e. spaced too closely) may be permitted to plant replacement
trees in the parkway or elsewhere in the Village, if approved by Development
Services Department.



            5.   Cash in Lieu.  If required mitigation trees,
or any other tree required by Code, cannot be provided on the site, the
petitioner shall pay cash in lieu of tree replacement in the amount of $400
for each two and one-half (2.5) inch caliper deciduous canopy tree or eight
(8) foot evergreen tree to the Village's Tree Preservation and Green
Infrastructure Account. Such a fee in lieu of mitigation must be approved by
the Development Services Department and can only be used when replacement on
site is not possible. The quantity of trees requiring mitigation does not
count towards a reduction in the quantity of trees or landscaping required by
this Section.



The maximum cash in lieu amount for projects less than 10 acres in area is
$50,000. The maximum cash in lieu amount for projects greater than 10 acres
in area is $100,000. Any cash in lieu amount above the set maximum amount
will be waived by the Village. A 10% reduction of Tree Mitigation cash in
lieu amount will awarded if said fee is paid in full before or at time of
final landscape plan approval.



            6.   Tree Preservation and Green Infrastructure
Account.  The Tree Preservation and Green Infrastructure Account shall be
used to support Village-initiated tree planting and green infrastructure
projects located on public property within the Village of Orland Park and
shall be administered by the Development Services Department. This account
shall be used only for tree preservation and green infrastructure projects
approved by the Village Board.



            7.   Tree Preservation Credit.  A credit of $150
per caliper inch will be applied towards a project's tree mitigation fee for
every healthy (fair to good) native tree preserved on site. Preservation
credit shall be for the preservation of native Illinois trees only, or as
determined by the Development Services Department. A Tree Preservation Credit
shall never exceed the tree mitigation fee amount. Adherence to an Village
approved Tree Preservation Plan shall be required for projects awarded tree
preservation credit. A line item in the amount of the tree preservation
credit will be applied to a project's letter of credit, which will be reduced
to zero after written verification from a Certified Arborist that the
preserved tree(s) are still in good to fair condition at least one year after
issuance of a project's certificate of occupancy. Preservation credit shall
not be applied towards any other fee other than tree mitigation fees.  (Amd.
Ord. 51672/20/17; Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



            (Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



         g.   Heritage Tree and Parkway Tree Removal.



            1.   All heritage trees and parkway trees shall be
replaced per the replacement standards set forth in Section 6-305.F.3.f Tree
Preservation Standards.  The number of replacement trees may be limited by
what can be reasonably accommodated within the available lot area, but any
reduction in mitigation requirements must be approved by the Development
Services Department.



            2.   A heritage tree that is dead or diseased may
be removed without replacement if the tree is certified as dead or diseased
by a certified arborist, to be retained by the homeowner, and with issuance
of a tree removal permit.



            3.   A parkway tree that is dead or dying may be
removed without replacement if the tree is confirmed as dead or diseased by
the Development Services Department or Public Works Department and with
issuance of a tree removal permit.



         h.   Procedures to Obtain a Tree Removal Permit For New
Development.



            1.   Tree Mitigation Plan. Developers of any site
for any use other than a single family home seeking a site plan or landscape
plan approval shall submit a Tree Mitigation Plan with the petition for
development. A tree mitigation plan shall include:



               i.   A tree survey showing the location,
edge of dripline, species, diameter at breast height (DBH) and condition of
every tree four (4) inches or larger, measured from four and a half (4.5')
feet from the ground, on the property. The survey shall distinguish existing
trees which are proposed to be destroyed, relocated, replaced, preserved at
their present location. The Development Services Department may require that
the tree survey exclude those portions of the site which it determines will
not be affected by the development activity.



               ii.   A tree mitigation report that
highlights the quantity, diameter at breast height (DBH) and condition of
trees to be removed and the quantity and caliper size of the required
replacement trees pursuant to the replacement standards set forth in Section
6-305.F.3.f Tree Replacement Standards.



            2.   A tree survey and tree mitigation report,
collectively known as a Tree Mitigation Plan, will be reviewed and approved
by the Development Services Department through the landscape plan review
process. Approval of a Tree Mitigation Plan shall be granted only if the
Development Services Department finds that all reasonable efforts have been
undertaken in the architectural layout and design of the proposed development
to preserve existing trees and to otherwise enhance the aesthetic appearance
of the development by the incorporation of trees in the design process.
Relocation or replacement of trees may be required as a condition of approval
in accordance with the criteria set forth in this Section. No tree removal
shall take place until a Tree Mitigation Plan has been approved by the
Development Services Department. (Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



         i.   Procedures to Obtain a Tree Removal Permit For
Single Family Homes and Existing Development.



            1.   All others requesting a tree removal permit
shall fill out a tree removal permit application prescribed by the
Development Services Department prior to its removal or relocation. The
applicant shall provide the following information:



               i.   Information on the type of tree and the
size of the tree under consideration;



               ii.   Reason(s) for the tree(s)
removal/relocation;



               iii.   Photograph(s) of the condition and
location of the tree in question;



               iv.   At least one full scale photo of the
tree(s) showing its surrounding environment. Any photographs supporting the
reason(s) for relocation/removal should be included;



               v.   A copy of the plat of survey for the
property showing the location of the existing building(s) and outlining the
location of the existing tree(s) in question. If the tree location/removal
involves existing or proposed utilities, driveways, structures, easements or
other pertinent site features, these should also be drawn in to scale. Plans
may be drawn by property owners; and



               vi.   A description of the tree(s) to be
planted to replace any removed trees.



            2.   Approval of a tree removal permit shall be
granted only if the Development Services Department finds that all reasonable
efforts have been undertaken in the architectural layout and design of the
proposed development to preserve existing trees and to otherwise enhance the
aesthetic appearance of the development by the incorporation of trees in the
design process.  Relocation or replacement of trees may be required as a
condition of approval in accordance with the criteria set forth in this
Section. No tree removal shall take place until the issuance of a tree
removal permit.



            3.   If the Development Services Department
determines that the scope of the tree removal exceeds the provisions of this
Section, the applicant must supply the information listed in Section
6-305.F.3.h Procedures to Obtain a Tree Removal Permit for New Development.



         j.   Final Inspection.



            1.   No final certificate of occupancy or letter
of credit release shall be issued until the relocation or replacement of
trees, or payment of any outstanding tree mitigation fees, as required by the
approved mitigation plan or tree removal permit, has been completed and the
final landscape inspection approval has been given by the Development
Services Department. Trees relocated from one portion of the site to another
which do not survive transplanting shall be replaced with a suitable
replacement tree as specified by the Development Services Department. Should
the Department determine that, due to the time of the year that the
certificate of compliance and occupancy is requested, the relocation or
replacement of trees should be deferred until a more suitable time, a
certificate of compliance and occupancy may be issued provided that:



               i.   The letter of credit is renewed in an
amount to cover the remaining landscaping to be installed.



               ii.   If a project does not have a letter of
credit with the Village, the applicant(s) provides the Development Services
Department with a cash deposit or bond in the amount equal to the cost of the
relocation or replacement of trees;



               iii.   The applicant completes all required
tree relocation or replacement within the time frame specified by the
Development Services Department. The cash deposit or bond will be returned to
the applicant provided that all work is completed within the established time
frame. (Amd. Ord. 5221  9/18/17)



            2.   Should the applicant fail to comply with the
above item, the Development Services Department may elect to use the cash
bond or letter of credit to hire a landscaper to complete the required tree
relocation or replacement. Excess cash deposit, letter of credit or bond
funds, if any, will then be returned to the applicant.



         k.   Exceptions.



            1.   In the event that any tree shall pose a
threat to one's health, safety or property and require immediate removal
without formal Village approval (e.g. a tree which has been blown over or
struck by lightning), verbal authorization may be given by the Development
Services Department and the tree removed without obtaining a written permit
as herein required. Such verbal authorization shall later be confirmed in
writing by the Department.



            2.   All state approved and governmental plant or
tree nurseries and botanical gardens shall be exempt from the terms and
provisions of this Section, but only in relation to those trees which are
planted and grown for the sale or intended sale to the general public in the
ordinary course of business or for some public purpose.



            3.   A tree removal authorization may be issued
when a tree, due to natural circumstances, is dead or irreversibly declining,
is in danger of falling, is too close to existing structures so as to
endanger such structures, interferes with utility services, creates unsafe
vision clearance, or constitutes a health hazard. Such trees may be removed
only after the Development Services Department or Public Works Department has
verified that such a condition exists.



            4.   A tree removal authorization may be issued
when a tree removal is necessary to observe good forestry practice such as
the number of healthy trees a given parcel of land will support or when such
removal is in accordance with a documented landscape management plan.



         l.   Civil Remedies.  In addition to any other remedies
provided by this Section the Village shall have the following judicial
remedies available for violations of this Section or any permit condition
promulgated under this Section.



            1.   The Village may institute a civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction to establish liability and to recover damages
for any injury caused by the removal of trees in contravention of the terms
of this Section.



            2.   The Village may institute a civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction to seek injunctive relief to enforce
compliance with this Section to enjoin any violation hereof; and to seek
injunctive relief to prevent irreparable injury to the trees and/or
properties encompassed by the terms of this Section.

SECTION 6-306.   OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.



   A.   Purpose.



      1.   In order to reduce the visual impact of large residential
and nonresidential parking areas, to minimize the adverse effects of
off-street parking on adjacent properties, and to ensure the proper
development of parking areas throughout the Village, off-street parking and
loading spaces for every use shall be provided in accordance with the
standards established in this Section.



      2.   For any off-street parking area required under this
Section, and for any public parking lot, garage, and storage area operated on
a commercial basis, an off-street parking management plan shall be submitted
as part of site plan review.



   B.   Required Number of Off-Street Parking Spaces.



      1.   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2) below,
each principal use on a parcel shall be provided with the number of
off-street parking spaces indicated for that use in Table 6-306(B).



      2.   In the event that the number of parking spaces listed on
Table 6-306(B) cannot be placed on the parcel in accordance with these
regulations without the demolition of an existing structure to accommodate a
parking area, the Development Services Department may authorize up to a
twenty percent (20%) reduction in the total number of parking spaces required
on the lot.  The Development Services Department may issue such an
authorization only upon the request of the applicant and only upon
determining that the reduction in the number of required parking spaces will
not unreasonably increase parking congestion along public streets or in
parking areas located on nearby lots.  After such authorization is granted,
the ap-plicant shall not demolish or remove the existing structure without
the approval of the Development Services Department.  (Ord. 4373 - 6/2/08)



      3.   In the event that an applicant demonstrates that a new
commercial use, whether in an existing building or new construction, will
require more parking spaces than the number allocated under Table 6-306(B),
the Development Services Department may authorize up to a twenty percent
(20%) increase in the total number of parking spaces permitted on the lot. 
Any request exceeding a twenty percent (20%) increase in the total number of
parking spaces permitted on the lot shall be a variance.  The Development
Services Department may issue such authorization only upon the request of the
applicant and only upon determining that the new use will attract more
vehicles than the parking lot could otherwise accommodate.  (Ord.2860 -
3/18/96; Amd. Ord. 4373 - 6/2/08; Amd. Ord. 4839  9/16/13)



      4.   In the event that an applicant demonstrates that fewer
parking spaces are needed to serve the use at the time of permit application,
the Development Services Department may authorize a reduction in the amount
of parking spaces and reserve additional land for potential use as parking
spaces at a future time.  (Ord. 4373 - 6/2/08)



      5.   When the required number of off-street parking spaces
computed according to Table 6-306(B) results in a fractional number, the
number of required parking spaces shall be determined as follows:  any
fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and
fractions over one-half (1/2) shall require one (1) parking space.



      6.   If a use is not listed in Table 6-306(B), The Development
Services Department shall determine the number of off-street parking spaces
that shall be required.

(Amd. Ord. 5126 - 9/19/16)



      2.   Off-street parking spaces for the handicapped shall be
designed as follows:



         a.   All spaces for the handicapped shall have access to
a curb-ramp or curb-cut when necessary to allow access to the building
served, shall be located so that users will not be compelled to wheel behind
parked vehicles, and shall be located the shortest possible distance between
the parking area and the entrance to the prin-cipal building it serves.



         b.   The total number of accessible parking spaces may
be distributed among parking lots, if greater accessibility is achieved in
consideration of such factors as anticipated usage, number and location of
entrances and level of parking areas.



         c.   Each parking space for the handicapped shall be at
least sixteen (16) feet wide including an eight (8) foot wide access aisle,
and adjacent parking spaces shall not share a common access aisle.  All
access aisles shall blend to a common level with an accessible route and
shall be diagonally striped.



         d.   Parallel parking spaces for the handicapped shall
be located either at the beginning or end of a block, or adjacent to alley
entrances.  Curbs adjacent to such spaces shall be of a height which will
not interfere with the opening and closing of motor vehicle doors.



         e.   No accessible parking spaces shall be required if
only attendant or valet parking is provided and is available at all times
that the facility is open for public use.  If accessible at-grade parking is
available, at least one (1) space for self parking of a vehicle with
sensitive specialized control devices shall be provided.



         f.   Each parking space for the handicapped shall be
equipped with a sign which complies with 625 ILCS 5/11-301, as amended, and
shall meet the requirements of Sign R7-8, U.S. Department of Transportation
Standard and the Illinois Department of Transportation.  Signs shall bear
the internationally accepted wheelchair symbol and shall be vertically
mounted on a post or a wall at the front center of the parking space, no more
than five (5) feet horizontally from the front of the parking space, and set
a minimum of four (4) feet from finished grade to the bottom of the sign.



(Ord.2860-3/18/96)



   E.   Location of Required Parking.



      1.   Required off-street parking spaces accessory to
residential dwellings shall be located on the same lot as the use served.



      2.   Required off-street parking spaces accessory to
nonresidential districts shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet 
of the use served, except for spaces accessory to overnight accommodations,
which shall be within three hundred (300) feet of the use served.



      3.   No parking spaces accessory to a use in a nonresidential
district may be located in a residential district, unless a special use
permit is obtained in accordance with Section 5-105.  Off-street private
parking and municipal parking lots may be permitted with a special use permit
provided they are completely within five hundred (500) feet of the boundary
of a BIZ, OOH, MFG, COR, VCD or ORI district.  (Ord. 4647, 5-16-11)



      4.   Where these regulations allow shared parking between uses
on different lots, all such off-street parking areas shall be located no more
than five hundred (500) feet from the use they are intended to serve.



      5.   One (1) recreational vehicle or utility or haul trailer
may be parked in a driveway, provided it is located at least five (5) feet
from a side, rear, or front lot line, and not less than ten (10) feet from an
adjoining residential building.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94 & Ord. 3672 - 8/5/02;
Amd. Ord. 4373 - 6/2/08; Amd. Ord. 4574; 7/6/10)



      6.   Except as otherwise provided herein, no commercial
vehicle (e.g. truck) which either has a weight in excess of 8,000 pounds,
including vehicle or maximum load, or which exceeds twenty-one (21) feet in
length, eight (8) feet in width or nine (9) feet in height may be parked on
either streets or alleys.  However, commercial vehicles may be parked for a
reasonable period of time necessary to pick up or deliver property, or
necessary to install or assemble such delivered property or to prepare such
property for loading and removal.  The overnight parking of such vehicles
shall not be permitted in any setback.



      7.   Front setbacks:



         a.   Passenger automobile parking is permitted in a
front setback on a private driveway serving detached and attached dwellings,
but shall not be considered as satisfying the off-street parking requirements
for such uses as required by these regulations, unless there are a minimum of
two (2) off-street parking spaces located elsewhere on the lot.



         b.   Off-street parking spaces for nonresidential uses
may not be located in the front and corner-side building setbacks between the
building and the right-of-way. However, parking spaces may locate no closer
than ten (10) feet from the right-of-way provided that they are to the side
of the building.  (Ord. 4273 - 6/2/08)



         c.   No parking shall be permitted in the front setback
for any use located in the Old Orland Historic (OOH) District.



      8.   Side setbacks:



         a.   Passenger Automobile parking is not permitted in
any required side setback in a residential district.  Passenger automobile
parking is permitted in the driveway of the required corner side yard
setback, with a twenty (20) foot minimum driveway length, excluding
right-of-way and sidewalks.  No open off-street parking serving a
residential use in a non-required side setback shall be located nearer than
five (5) feet to a principal residential building.  (Ord.2959-11/18/96)



         b.   Parking may be permitted in the side setback of a
nonresidential district.  However, where the nonresidential district abuts a
residential district, parking shall not be permitted in the side setback.



         c.   Parking may be permitted in the side setback of a
lot that abuts a railroad right-of-way.



      9.   Rear setbacks:



         a.   Passenger Automobile parking is permitted in any
rear setback of a lot with a detached garage on the driveway, but not in the
rear if the house has an attached garage, subject to the exceptions and
requirements of Subsection (b).



         b.   In a nonresidential district, when a rear setback
is adjacent to a residential district, no parking shall be permitted within
twenty (20) feet of a residential district.



   F.   Shared Parking.



      1.   In order to reduce the total number of parking spaces
which would otherwise be required according to Subsection (B) above, joint
use of up to fifty percent (50%) of required parking spaces may be permitted
for two (2) or more uses located on the same or adjacent parcels.  In order
to qualify for a joint use reduction, the owner of the parking lot and the
owner(s) of adjacent uses must demonstrate that the shared parking will not
create a parking shortage during peak hours.



      2.   Any sharing of required parking spaces by uses located on
different parcels shall be guaranteed by a legally binding written agreement
between the owner of the parking area and the owner of any use located on a
different parcel and served by the parking area that is approved by the
Village Attorney.



      3.   In the event that joint use of parking spaces becomes
inappropriate, in the opinion of the Development Services Department, after a
shared parking program has been implemented, the agreement in Subsection (2)
above shall be set aside.  The required number of off-street parking spaces
shall be computed and provided according to the provisions of Subsection (B),
above. 



   G.   Parking Lot Barriers.  Peripheral barriers, such as curbs,
walls, or fences, shall be located along the perimeter of parking lots,
garages and vehicle storage areas, except at entrances and exits.  These
parking barriers shall be designed and located to prevent parked vehicles
from extending beyond property lines and from hanging over any sidewalk or
other pedestrian path. All barriers shall be designed and located in
accordance with the standards set out in Section 6-305. (Ord. 4373 - 6/2/08)



   H.   Bicycle Parking.  All nonresidential uses containing ten (10)
or more automobile parking spaces shall provide bicycle parking facilities at
the rate of three (3) bicycle parking spaces for the first thirty (30)
automobile parking spaces provided and one (1) additional bicycle parking
space for each ten (10) additional automobile parking spaces provided, up to
a maximum of thirty (30) bicycle parking spaces.  Bicycle racks shall be
installed to support the frame of the bicycle and not just the wheel.



   I.   Maintenance.  All parking areas shall be kept in a dust-free
condition at all times. 



   J.   Number, Size and Location of Loading Spaces.



      1.   Any loading space and any area required for maneuvering a
vehicle into and out of the loading space shall be located entirely on the
same lot as the use it serves.  The unenclosed loading space shall not be
located on any public right-of-way or other lot, and shall be oriented away
from the street fronting the lot.



      2.   No loading space for vehicles over two (2) tons capacity
shall be closer than fifty (50) feet to any residential district, unless it
is completely enclosed by either building walls or a uniformly painted solid
fence or wall which is not less than six (6) feet in height.



      3.   No loading space or dock may be located within the
required front setback.  Completely enclosed loading spaces may face a
public street, provided the garage door is kept closed at all times and
during loading and unloading operations.  Vehicles waiting for loading or
unloading shall not park or be stored within the required front setback.



      4.   Off-street loading spaces may be permitted obstructions
in rear setbacks, so long as they are not closer than fifty (50) feet from
the nearest building or structure.



      5.   Unless otherwise provided by these regulations, a
required loading space shall be at least twelve (12) feet in width by at
least twenty-five (25) feet in length, exclusive of aisles and maneuvering
space, and shall have a vertical clearance of at least fourteen (14) feet.



      6.   Loading spaces shall be provided on the basis of the
floor area of the establishments they serve, as indicated in Table 6-306(L).

   K.   Restriction on Use of Off-Street Parking and Loading Spaces



   The storage of merchandise, materials, or motor vehicles, and/or the
repair of motor vehicles or any other kind of equipment, is prohibited in all
off-street parking and loading areas, including required and not required
spaces. Temporary storage units as regulated by Section 6-304.C.12 shall be
permitted.  (Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



   L.   Configuration of Off-Street Parking and Loading Ingress and
Egress.



      1.   Ingress and egress to and from off-street parking and
loading spaces shall be provided by means of clearly limited and defined
entrance and exit drives which lead from public rights-of-way to clearly
limited and defined maneuvering lanes which in turn provide access to
in-dividual off-street parking or loading spaces.



      2.   Layout configurations which require backing directly onto
an arterial street are prohibited.



(Ord. 4647 - 5/16/11)



      3.   On arterial roadways, the number of access points shall
be limited to one (1), unless a competent traffic engineering study
determines that site access would be improved by additional access points. 
The minimum space between access drives shall be based on roadway speed and
not on speed type and shall be determined by the Department of Development
Services.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      4.   Wherever practicable, access drives shall be shared by
several uses.  Such uses shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance
and landscaping of the drive.



   M.        Truck Trailer Parking.   One truck trailer shall be
allowed for every 20,000 square feet of building, excluding those parked in a
loading dock, limited to side and rear setbacks and no closer than 30 feet to
the property line.  These trailers shall be screened year-round from
adjacent public right-of-way and residences with adequate landscaping/berming.



(Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00)



   N.   Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Parking Standards.



(Ord. 4574 - 7/6/10)



      1.   Vehicle to Grid (V2G) Parking Standards. V2G refers to
the system of communication between electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles and
the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering
electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate. Such vehicles
are often either battery electric vehicles (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs and PHEVs displace the use of petroleum fossil fuels,
improve transportation fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Since most vehicles are parked the majority of the time, BEV or PHEV
batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the vehicle to the power
lines and back, registering potential energy savings to utilities per
vehicle. As BEVs and PHEVs become more main-stream, the purpose of this
subsection is to regulate vehicle to grid (V2G) land uses and associated
technologies.



         a.   Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). EVSE are
the plug-in or power control stations (e.g. electric vehicle battery
chargers) that allow BEVs and PHEVs to re-charge batteries. EVSE technologies
must meet and comply with the most up to date provisions of the National
Electrical Code for Level 2 conductive power stations and be approved by
Underwriters Laboratories. One EVSE power station will be permitted per
parking space.



         b.   Electric Utility Interface and Screening. ComEd
shall be contacted to determine appropriate grid interconnection and
interfacing, including metering policies. All associated and ancillary
equipment, batteries, devices, structures or support(s) for EVSE shall be
screened from the public right-of-way with low native landscaping. Cables,
wires and other transmission conduits or lines, with the exception of the
actual EVSE to vehicle plug/ adapter cable, providing connections from the
EVSE to the electrical distribution point or to buildings or non-vehicle
batteries must be installed underground.



         c.   EVSE Ports. EVSE ports are two (2) or more EVSE
power control stations/ parking spaces aligned adjacent to each other. These
typically are associated with specific parking spaces in a parking lot or
structure. In parking lots EVSE ports can have canopies to protect the EVSE
power stations from weather, provide adequate lighting for safety and
convenience, and provide a platform for co-located renewable energy
conversion systems to produce onsite energy. Two types of EVSE ports are
permitted through an administrative review. EVSE ports may not locate between
the building and street.  (Ord. 4738 - 6/18/12)



            1.   Utility Public Charging Port (UPCP). A UPCP
is an EVSE port established in a publically owned and maintained parking lot
by either the electrical utility that services the area (ComEd) or the local
government. UPCPs shall be permitted in all zoning districts.



            2.   Private Charging Port (PCP). A PCP is an EVSE
port established in a privately owned and maintained parking lot by the
private property owner or property management company. A PCP is permitted in
R-4, VC, BIZ, COR, MFG, ORI and OL district parking lots. Commercial and
multi-family PCPs do not typically require canopies for Underwriters
Laboratories approved charging equipment. However, providing shelter over
charging equipment to protect from rain or snow fall is permitted.



         d.   Location of EVSE and EVSE Ports. EVSEs must be
located in accessible locations in parking lots near electrical distribution
points/ transformer boxes (typically within 40 feet) and/ or on light poles
in parking lots  for commercial properties or, for multi-residential
properties, near a PHEV/BEV tenant's electrical meter for appropriate grid
connectivity and metering. 



         e.   V2G Parking Only Spaces. V2G parking spaces shall
meet the requirements for standard parking spaces as outlined in this
section. In addition to these requirements, the EVSE shall be centered at the
top of the parking space and protected by either stopping blocks, in the
absence of curbs, or curbs. V2G parking only spaces may be used by regular
automobiles if no other parking spaces are available.



         f.   V2G Parking Requirements. V2G parking requirements
are voluntary. If V2G parking is proposed, there shall be one (1) V2G parking
space per the first 30 required parking spaces and one (1) V2G space for
every 10 required parking spaces thereafter.



         g.   Overnight V2G Parking in Parking Lots. Overnight
parking in V2G parking spaces and lots is not permitted for recreation
vehicles (10 p.m. to 10 a.m.). Overnight V2G parking is permitted for
non-recreation PHEVs/ BEVs in publicly accessible parking lots via permit
parking.



SECTION 6-307.   SIGNS.



   A.   Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish equitable
regulations and promote excellence in design for communication through
signage within the Village of Orland Park. These regulations were developed
with the following intentions:



      1.   To preserve and promote the public health, safety, and
welfare through the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of all signs.



      2.   To confirm that signs may cause harm to the public by
creating obstructions, providing distractions to motorists, displacing
alternative land uses, decreasing property values and aesthetics, and
endangering the safety of person and property.



      3.   To establish the Village's substantial and compelling
interest in regulating signs in a manner as to reduce the effects and impacts
signs have on the public health, safety, and welfare.



      4.   To preserve property values within the Village by
regulating and directing the design, location, construction, and maintenance
of signs.



      5.   To protect the Village's physical appearance by
encouraging a sense of aesthetic appreciation for the visual environment and
compatibility with the surroundings.



      6.   To support the Village's economy by recognizing the need
for adequate site identification and maintaining effective communication
between signs and the public.



      7.   To protect the general public, pedestrians, and motorists
within the Village by assuring the design, location, construction, and
maintenance of signs allow safe navigation and travel throughout the Village
and ensure signs do not create distractions, obstructions, and hazards.



      8.   To enhance the physical appearance of site identification
to be in harmony with the visual character of the Village and for the signage
to be an integral part of the aesthetic of the site and be cohesive with the
architectural style of associated buildings.



      9.   To encourage signs that support adopted Village
guidelines, standards, and plans or the principles within said documents.



   B.   Applicability. The regulations within this Section apply to all
properties within the Village's municipal boundaries except for those
properties owned, used, leased, or controlled by the Village. Village signage
on Village property is exempt due to the inherent public purpose of such
messaging and sign copy. All signs on the exterior of a property, building,
or structure, and interior signs visible from exterior windows are subject to
the regulations within this Section. This Section shall not apply to the Old
Orland Historic District.



   C.   General Standards.



      1.   Village Codes. Signs shall meet all applicable Village
codes, including the Building Code, as amended from time to time.



      2.   Interpretation. All regulations within this Section shall
be interpreted by the Development Services Department. An interpretation may
be appealed to the Plan Commission for a final decision.



         a.   Conflict. In the event of a conflict within this
Section and/or between this Section and any provision within another Village
Code, the most restrictive regulation shall apply.



         b.   Substitution Clause. To the extent the regulations
of this Section 6-307 permit commercial signs, such regulations are also to
permit non-commercial signs.



         c.   Minimum and Maximum. All provisions herein shall be
interpreted as maximum allowable regulations unless otherwise noted.



         d.   Measurement and Calculation.



            1.   Sign Face Area. The sign face area (SFA)
shall be the entire area of the sign face(s) on an individual wall, ground,
or other type of sign. The area of a sign face shall be determined by
calculating the area within a single continuous perimeter encompassing the
entire advertising copy or art designed to attract attention. The area within
the single continuous perimeter shall be calculated by determining the area
of the smallest measurable square, circle, rectangle, or triangle within the
single continuous perimeter, including the background. For ground signs with
multiple faces: when two identical ground sign faces are placed back to back
so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when
such sign faces are part of the same sign structure, the sign face area shall
be the area of one side of the sign. In all other circumstances, the sign
face area of a ground sign shall be the total sign face area of all sign
faces on the ground sign. The background color of a wall sign is included
within the measurement of sign face area for wall signs unless otherwise
considered an architectural feature by the Development Services Department.







 



         2.   Sign Height (Ground Sign). A ground sign shall be
measured vertically from the adjacent average natural grade to the top of the
sign. The measurement includes the full height of the sign, including the
base or support structure and any design element surrounding or enclosing the
sign face.







 



            3.    Roof Signs. The roof is measured from grade
to the highest point of the roof line, parapet, or fascia of the building.
Signs shall be located below this point.



            4.    Tenant Frontage. The tenant frontage is
measured horizontally between the limits of the tenant's leasable space.







            5.   Clearance. Sign clearance is measured
vertically from grade to the bottom of the sign.







 



            6.   Window Signs. The sign face area of window
signs shall be measured by individual windows.







 



      3.   Accessory Structu re/Use. Signs shall be accessory
structures/uses and shall not be principal structures/uses. As such, all
signs must be accessory to an occupant of the land (or development) on which
the sign is located.



      4.   Distractions, Obstru ctions, and Hazards. Signs shall not
cause distractions, obstructions, or hazards and shall abide by the following
requirements:



         a.   Legibility. All letters and characters on each sign
shall be legible from the public right-of-way and/or the parking spaces
closest to the sign. The edges of the letters and characters shall be cleanly
defined, unfaded, and maintain a clear contrast with the background.



         b.   Conflict with Traffic and Pedestrian Signs. Signs
shall not conflict with traffic or pedestrian signs. Signs and/or
illumination shall not resemble emergency lighting or signals.



         c.   Ingress/Egress. No sign shall be erected so as to
prevent free ingress to or egress from any door or window, or any other point
of access into a building required by the Village Building Code or Fire
Protection District regulations, or any amendments thereto, nor shall any
sign be erected so as to impair access to the roof of a building.



         d.   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). No sign
shall be erected so as to obstruct accessibility requirements per the
Illinois Accessibility Code, Village Building Code, and any amendments
thereto.



         e.   Construction and Attachment. All signs shall be
designed and constructed as required in the Village Building Code and other
applicable Village ordinances, as amended from time to time. Signs shall be
securely attached to a wall, structure, or the ground at all times.



         f.   Line-of-Sight. Signs shall not cause visibility
obstructions.



      5.   Location.



         a.   Public Property. Signs shall not be erected on
public property, including the public right-of-way, except for Governmental
Signs per Section 6-307.D.1.a.1.



         b.   Private Property. Signs may be located within
private property lines on the premises identified by the signs. For
multi-tenant and/or multi-story buildings, wall signs shall be located within
the tenant's lease lines.



         c.   Parkways. Signs shall not be erected within
parkways, except for Governmental Signs per Section 6-307.D.1.a.1.

annexation of the property on which they are located and not conforming to
the provisions of this Section, shall be regarded as nonconforming signs.
Nonconforming signs shall be of two types: legal nonconforming or illegal
nonconforming.



      1.   Legal Nonconforming Signs. Nonconforming signs that were
lawfully permitted by the Village shall be considered legal nonconforming
signs. The following activities are allowed for legal nonconforming signs and
may require a permit from the Development Services Department:



         a.   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance
and incidental repair are allowed for legal nonconforming signs, provided
that any repair or maintenance shall, whenever possible, eliminate or reduce
any nonconformity. The allowable scope of repair and maintenance for legal
nonconforming signs includes:



            1.   The replacement of non-load-bearing sign
elements and electrical wiring and fixtures; and



            2.   The replacing, repairing, or repainting of
any portion of a sign or its structural elements, provided that the sign is
not structurally altered to prolong its useful life.



         b.   Change in Display of Sign Content. The periodic
changing of tenant's sign panels or the renewing of copy that has been made
unusable by ordinary wear and tear, weather, or accident is allowed on legal
nonconforming signs.



         c.   Alteration, Enlargement, and Relocation. Legal
nonconforming signs shall not be:



            1.   Changed or altered in any manner that would
increase the degree of its nonconformity;



            2.   Enlarged or expanded; and/or



            3.   Moved in whole or in part to any other
location where the sign would remain nonconforming.



      2.   Illegal Nonconforming Signs. Nonconforming signs that do
not have a valid permit on file with the Village shall be considered illegal
nonconforming signs.



         a.   Removal. Illegal nonconforming signs shall be
immediately removed at the expense of the owner.



         b.   Alteration. The owner of an illegal nonconforming
sign may obtain a permit to alter the illegal nonconforming sign to conform
with all applicable Village codes.



   J.   Severability. If any portion of this document is to any extent
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, such term shall be excluded
to the extent of such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability; all other
terms hereof shall remain in full force and effect.



   K.   Definitions. In the event of a conflict within this Section and
within Section 2-102 (Definitions) of the Land Development Code the
definitions herein shall apply.



      1.   Average Natural Grade: When measuring sign height, the
average natural grade shall mean the average grade measured ten feet (10') in
every direction from the sign location.



      2.   Frontage, Tenant: The horizontal distance between a
tenant's lease lines along a façade facing a public right-of-way, private
access drive, and/or parking lot. Tenant Frontage shall not include frontage
along outdoor sales areas and accessory structures.



      3.   Sign: Any object, device, display, or structure, or part
thereof, which is used primarily to advertise, identify, display or direct or
attract attention to an object, person, establishment, product, service,
event or location by any means including, but not limited to: words, letters,

SECTION 6-308.   DESIGN STANDARDS.



   A.   Purposes.  The following are the purposes of the architectural
design standards set forth in this Section:



      1.   To create an architectural identity and to avoid
monotonous similarity or inappropriateness in exterior design and appearance
of property;



      2.   To promote the orderly and harmonious growth of the
Village, and to protect and enhance land values, investments, and the general
welfare of the citizens of the Village;



      3.   To protect and to stabilize the general appearance of
buildings, structures, landscaping, and open space areas throughout the
Village;



      4.   To insure adequate light, air and privacy for property
throughout the Village;



      5.   To encourage and promote acceptability, attractiveness,
cohesiveness and compatibility of new development so as to maintain and
improve the established standards of property values throughout the Village;
and



      6.   To aid prospective contractors, architects, designers and
developers in preparing their project plans for review by the Village.



   B.   Applicability.  The design standards shall apply to single
family residential developments of seven (7) units or more and to all other
types of developments, including privately and publicly owned properties,
except for those developments located in the Old Orland Historic (OOH)
District.



   C.   Administration. 



      1.   An applicant for development approval shall submit a site
plan, exterior elevations, and such other data deemed necessary by the
Department of Development Services to evaluate a proposed architectural
design, along with an application for development approval, as required by
Sections 5-101 (General Procedures) and 5-106 (Appearance/Site Plan
Review).  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      2.   Final plans and elevations shall be drawn to scale and
shall indicate the nature and extent of the work proposed. 



      3.   The Department of Development Services shall develop
graphic illustrations of the standards set forth in this Section.  The
Department shall also ensure that development within the district complies
with the guidelines established in the Old Orland Historic District
Guidelines, as amended from time to time, copies of which shall be kept on
file in the Department's offices.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      4.   The review of architecture and site plans provided for in
this Section is intended to be only a part of the whole review procedure laid
out in these regulations.  Approval of architectural design does not in any
way signify final approval of any portion of any project.



   D.   Pre-Application Conference. An applicant for architectural
design approval may request in writing that the Department of Development
Services hold an informal pre-application conference to review the
preliminary architectural design of a proposed development.  This
pre-application conference may be conducted concurrently with the
pre-application conference provided for in Section 5-101(A) and shall be
conducted pursuant to the same terms and conditions set forth in that
Section.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   E.   Review.  The Development Services Department shall review the
complete application for appearance review in conjunction with site plan
review provided for in Section 5-106. Recommendations of the Department shall
be based upon the criteria set forth in Subsections F through O, below. 
(Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   F.   Building and Structure Design.



      1.   Buildings and structures shall be consistent with the
established neighborhood character and with any adjacent residential property.



      2.   Building materials shall be selected for suitability to
the type of buildings and the design in which they are used.  Buildings
shall use the same materials, or those which are architecturally harmonious,
for all building walls and other exterior building components that are wholly
or partially visible from public ways.



      3.   Building materials shall be of durable quality.
Inappropriate materials or building methods, and those which will produce
inconsistency with the structure and architecture of the building, shall be
avoided.



      4.   Brick or other masonry materials shall be used for all
sides of all nonresidential development and shall be installed per Village
Building Code specifications.  At a minimum:



         a.   For single story structures, anchored brick, stone
or similar masonry materials as approved by Development Services Department
shall extend from the adjacent grade to the top of the window that is highest
on the subject façade, with minor accents allowed in place of masonry
subject to meeting building codes.



         b.   For two or three-story structures, anchored brick,
stone or similar masonry materials as approved by Development Services
Department shall extend from the adjacent grade to the top of each story with
minor accents allowed in place of masonry subject to meeting building codes.



         c.   For structures four stories or more in height,
anchored brick, stone or similar masonry materials as approved by Development
Services Department shall extend from the adjacent grade to the top of the
first three (3) stories, with minor accents allowed in place of masonry
subject to meeting building codes. Village approved non-masonry materials may
be used only on the uppermost story of structures that are four (4) stories
or more in height. See Village Code Title 5 Chapter 1 Section 501.3.2
Exception B. for additional requirements.  (Amd. Ord. 5126  9/19/16)



   No mansard roofs shall be permitted.  Brick shall not be painted,
except if approved under an Appearance Review. If an Appearance Review denial
is appealed to Plan Commission, resulting in permission to paint a masonry
surface, paint and painting procedure specifications shall be submitted to
the Development Services Department for review and approval prior to
initiation of any masonry paint-related work.



(Ord. 2462 - 10/18/93; Amd. Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00; Amd. Ord 3672 - 8/5/02; Amd.
Ord. 50611/18/16; Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



      5.   All residential dwelling units shall contain face brick
or stone on not less than fifty (50) percent of exterior walls and shall
contain face brick or stone on ninety (90) percent of each first floor
elevation or ground levels of such units.  All materials for the remaining
ground level wall surfaces shall be approved by the Building Director.  All
materials used shall be compatible as a group and with the surrounding
structures.  (Ord. 2570  - 5/2/94; Amd. Ord. 3281 - 8/16/99)



         a.   Exceptions. Existing residential developments
constructed where original buildings were of non-masonry exterior finishes
may permit the use of other code approved materials under the following
conditions:



            1.   Where the buildings total floor area is
not being increased by more than fifty (50) percent of the existing
buildings floor area;



            2.   Where the buildings fifty (50) percent
floor area allowance is regarded as the total combined floor areas of all
additions made to the residence within a forty- eight (48) month consecutive
time period;



            3.   Where the exterior finish materials meets the
design criteria standards referenced in the Land Development Code (Section
6-308) and the Villages Building Code (5-1-3 item #105 for amended Minimum
Thickness of Weather Coverings).



(Amd. Ord. 5061  1/18/16)



      6.   Building materials should be selected with special
attention to energy conservation.  Materials and colors that reduce the
consumption of gas and electricity should be used wherever possible.



      7.   Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and
parapets, shall have good proportions and relationship to one another. 



      8.   While it is recognized that color is a very subjective
matter and that creativity should not be stifled, colors should nonetheless
be used harmoniously and with some restraint.  Color schemes should consider
and respect the character and quality of structures in the area. Excessively
bright or brilliant colors should be used only for accent.  Materials and
colors should withstand the weather well over a twenty-five (25) year
period.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      9.   Architectural style should be appropriate to the Chicago
area and evaluation of a project shall be based on the quality of design and
its relationship to surroundings.  The design of structures should display a
sensitivity to the best aspects of the character, quality and scale of those
structures already existing in the area of a proposed project.



      10.   Monotony of design shall be avoided, however styles
should be complementary and should relate to indigenous architecture.  In
residential districts no two (2) detached single family dwellings of
substantially similar or identical front elevation or facade shall be
constructed or located on adjacent lots.  Said changes may be major or minor
changes.



         a.   Major changes.  One major change and color change

SECTION 6-311.   WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES AND SATELLITE DISHES



   A.   Purpose and Intent.   To ensure the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of the Village, all wireless communication facilities in the
Village must comply with the following standards and regulations.



   B.   Definition. Wireless communication facility means
infrastructure such as antenna, support structures, equipment, accessory
buildings, parking, and other uses associated with and ancillary to wireless
communication transmission.



   C.   Exceptions.  Dish antennas less than one meter in diameter,
private residence antennas, and private residence amateur radio equipment are
not regulated by this Code Section.



   D.   Authorization. No Person, firm, partnership, corporation, trust
or other legal entity shall install or modify a wireless communication
facility without obtaining Village authorization as described below.



   E.   Application.



      1.   An application or petition submitted to the Development
Services Department for a wireless communication facility will require an
administrative review for wireless communication co-locations, or a special
use permit for new monopoles or utility sub-stations (e.g. communication
shelters). See Section 5-101 General Procedures, Requirements and Regulations
for process details. The following required documentation must be submitted
as part of any petition:



         a.   As-built plat of survey of the subject lot showing
the exact location and dimensions of the proposed wireless communication
facility;



         b.   Complete description of the proposal.



         c.   A scaled elevation drawing showing all proposed
visible equipment.



         d.   Structural plans and a structural analysis report
prepared and stamped by a licensed Structural Engineer. No approvals or
permits shall be issued until all engineering reviews have been completed and
approved by the Village.  All plans must meet all applicable building codes
and current industry standards.



         e.   Letter of authorization from the property owner.



      2.   No project shall be constructed without meeting all
required building codes and obtaining necessary building permits.



   F.   General Standards of Wireless Communication Facilities.



      1.   Wireless communication facilities shall whenever and
wherever possible co-locate on existing vertical infrastructure (e.g. towers,
buildings etc.) and use stealth techniques and technologies to minimize their
visual and physical presence on a tower or building and shall employ methods
that blend wireless infrastructure into the surroundings so that they are not
visible or noticeable, particularly from neighboring rights-of-way, parks and
single family homes.  Wireless communication facilities must minimize or
avoid whenever possible any adverse aesthetic and visual impacts to the land,
property, building or tower on which they locate and neighbor.



      2.   Landscaping and opaque fences shall be used to mitigate
the effects of any ground equipment and/or utility sub-stations per the
design standards for new freestanding wireless communication facilities of
Section 6-311.G.3.g below.



      3.   Wireless communication facilities shall comply with all
site and structural requirements as outlined in the Land Development Code
unless otherwise stated in this Code section, and shall be compatible in
terms of architecture and site design with the surrounding neighborhood.



      4.   No equipment shall be operated so as to produce noise
above 45 dB as measured from the nearest property line of the lot on which
the wireless communication facility is located.



      5.   Wireless communication facilities shall not be
artificially lighted or marked except as required by law.



      6.   The color and materials of wireless communication
facilities shall blend with the surrounding environment for visual harmony
and to reduce physical masses. This may include matching or complementing
building colors and facades, rooftop units or infrastructure, and/ or more
generally the sky.



   G.   Location and Standards of Wireless Communication Facilities.



      1.   Wireless communication facilities may co-locate as a
permitted use via administrative review on existing vertical infrastructure
such as towers (e.g. existing lattice towers & monopoles), utility
transmission towers (with ComEd approvals), and on water towers provided they
do not include accessory buildings like shelters, which are considered
utility sub-stations.  Monopoles and existing legal non-conforming lattice
towers hosting co-locations shall be allowed a single increase in height of
not more than 50 feet over the original tower height via administrative
review to accommodate co-locations. If a tower is existing legal
non-conforming because it is within 500 feet of a residential building, the
height shall not be increased.  Water tower co-locations shall be allowed a
single increase in height of not more than fifty (50) feet over the first
co-location, which is considered the original height.



         a.   Placement of additional equipment on a
non-conforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the
non-conformity provided all building code safety and structural requirements
are met.



      2.   Wireless communication facilities may co-locate as a
permitted use via administrative review on non-residential buildings outside
of the Old Orland Historic District and on non-landmarked buildings using
stealth techniques and technologies provided they do not include accessory
buildings like shelters, which are considered utility sub-stations. The
co-location shall not increase the height of the building more than 15 feet
in any zoning district and shall meet all building code and structural
requirements.



      3.   Wireless communication facilities may locate as a new
freestanding monopole via a special use permit on any non-residential parcel
located in the VC Village Center District, BIZ General Business District, MFG
Manufacturing District, COR Mixed Use District or ORI Mixed Use District, or
on institutional parcels in any zoning district provided proximity
requirements to residential buildings are met.



         a.   The parcel must meet the minimum lot size
requirement of the zoning district in which it will be located.  (Ord. 3837
- 12/1/03)



         b.   Freestanding wireless communication facilities must
meet all setback requirements of the zoning district in which they will be
located.



         c.   Freestanding wireless communication facilities can
not be located in the required landscape buffers of the zoning district in
which they will be located.

fold over on themselves when necessary and meet current industry standards
for engineering.



         g.   The base and ground equipment of new freestanding
wireless communication facilities shall be screened with an 8 foot tall
solid, opaque fence enclosure constructed of either wood or neutral colored
(e.g. non-white) vinyl material. The base and ground equipment enclosure
shall be landscaped using Type 2 Bufferyard requirements as outlined in
Section 6-305, Landscape and Tree Preservation, of this Code. If the
required bufferyard cannot be accomplished due to spatial constraints, other
incremental improvements or a fee in lieu of landscaping may be required to
mitigate the visual impact to the surrounding area.  (Amd. Ord. 5061 -
1/18/16)



         h.   Existing on site vegetation shall be preserved or
enhanced where possible, and disturbance of existing topography shall be
minimized, unless such disturbance would reduce the visual impact on the
surrounding area.



      4.   A special use permit shall not be granted for a new
freestanding wireless communication facility unless one or more of the
following reasons is found to support it:



         a.   The planned wireless communication equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of an existing or approved tower or structure
within the search radius, as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional structural engineer, and the existing or approved tower or
structure cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the
planned or equivalent equipment at a reasonable cost;



         b.   The planned wireless communication equipment would
cause interference impacting the usability of other existing or planned
wireless infrastructure, as documented by a qualified and licensed
professional engineer, and the interference cannot be prevented at a

structures shall avoid environmentally sensitive areas and historically,
culturally, or architecturally significant areas and their associated
view-sheds.



      6.   New freestanding wireless communication facilities not
within the jurisdiction of the Village of Orland Park but within the one and
one-half mile extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village of Orland Park
shall fully comply with the standards and regulations of this Section
concerning proximity to residential lots.



      7.   A small wireless facility (as defined in Section 3-10-3
of Ordinance Number 5314 entitled "An Ordinance Amending The Municipal Code
Of The Village Of Orland Park Relative To The Permitting, Regulation And
Deployment Of Small Wireless Facilities") shall be a permitted use in all
rights-of-way in any zoning district established by Section 6-101 of this
Land Development Code and a permitted use on private property in the BIZ
General Business, MFG Manufacturing and ORI Mixed Use Office, Research &
Industrial Districts.  In addition, to the extent of any conflicts or
inconsistencies between the provisions of this Subsection G and the
provisions of said Ordinance Number 5314, the provisions of Ordinance Number
5314 shall govern and control.  (Ord. 5336  9/17/18)



   H.   Removal of Facility .

SECTION 6-313.   POLLUTION CONTROL STANDARDS.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that
industrial, research, and other business activities are good neighbors to
adjoining properties by controlling the emission of noise, odors, glare,
vibration, smoke, dust, liquid wastes, radiation, radioactivity, and similar
pollutants.  Accordingly, this Section sets forth performance standards and
conditions with which the Village expects the construction and operation of
industrial, research, and other business activities to comply.  In many
cases, the relation of a prospective use to all of these standards cannot be
judged properly at the time that a building permit is issued or some other
form of development approval is granted.  In such cases, the recipient of
the permit or approval should note that these performance standards, like all
the other provisions of these regulations, are continuing obligations and
that all industrial, research and other business uses shall be expected to
operate in compliance with these standards.  Any land use which fails to
comply with these standards shall be in violation of these regulations.



   B.   General Standards and Measures of Compliance.



      1.   All uses shall be conducted so as to preclude any
nuisance, hazard or commonly-recognized offensive condition or
characteristics of the use, including the creation or emission on other
properties of dust, gas, smoke, noise, fumes, odors, vibrations, particulate
matter, chemical compounds, toxic matter, fire, explosions, electrical
disturbance, heat, glare, or excessive night illumination.  At any time
before or after a building is used or occupied, the Director of the Building
Department may require that adequate control measures be provided in
accordance with the requirements or standards of the appropriate state or
federal government agency responsible for regulating that condition or
pollutant, in order to protect the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience and general welfare from any such nuisance, hazard, condition or
pollutant.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



      2.   Federal and state environmental regulations may also
apply to one or more of the features governed by the standards in Subsection
C, below.  It is not the intent of this Section to supersede or replace
those federal or state regulations.  Rather, the intent is for the standards
of this Section to supplement and complement any applicable federal and state
regulations.  If any standards herein conflict with an applicable federal or
state standard, then the federal or  state standard shall control.



   C.   Performance Standards.  All uses and structures permitted in
Article 6, Part I (Districts) of these regulations shall meet the following

(GES). See Section 2-102 Definitions for more information. Unless otherwise
noted in these regulations, the following shall apply:



      1.   Petition. Petitioners seeking to construct or install an
ECT must submit a complete appearance review application to the Development
Services Department and apply for building permits.



      2.   Review. The application shall be reviewed in accordance
with these regulations and, if necessary, shall be deliberated at the next
available meeting of the Plan Commission.



      3.   ECT Review. An ECT Review is a review at Plan Commission
that requires notification of neighboring properties. There are two
categories of ECT Review: Residential and Commercial. For Residential ECT
projects, all residential uses within three hundred thirty (330) feet of an
ECT development shall be notified. For Non-Residential ECT projects, all
residential uses within five hundred (500) feet of an ECT development shall
be notified. Notification shall be issued via certified mail, with return
receipt requested, at least fifteen (15) to thirty (30) days in advance of
the Plan Commission meeting. If no residential uses are within the stated
buffers, notices are not necessary for the review at Plan Commission.



         a.   The notice shall be titled "Environmental Clean
Technology Review Notice". The notice shall include the date, time and place
of the Plan Commission meeting and the contact information of the Development
Services Department. The notice shall describe the type of ECT system that is
proposed for the property and that the intent is to, for example, generate
renewable energy in the case of WECS etc.



         b.   A contributing structure in the Old Orland Historic
District or an Orland Park Landmark shall require a Certificate of
Appropriateness (COA) review at the Plan Commission for an ECT. The same
notification requirements shall be under taken for a COA. (Amd. Ord. 4996 
6/15/15)



      4.   Exemption. Subject to Development Services Department
approval, the ECT projects listed below are exempt from the public
notification, Plan Commission/Committee review and Board approval
requirements detailed in Section 6-314.C.3. An appearance review and
compliance with all other ECT and Building Code requirements are still
required for projects which are granted such an exemption:



         a.   All geothermal energy system (GES) projects, both
residential and non-residential;

these regulations. Only MINIWECS mounted on buildings are permitted in the VC
district.



         a.   Height. The maximum height of a MINIWECS shall not
exceed fifty-five (55) feet from ground level to the top of the rotor blade.



         MINIWECS are intended to provide a small scale appli-
cation of wind technologies on non-residential proper- ties in the Village.
They are adaptable systems that can easily be retro-fitted onto existing
infrastructure and provide opportunities for distributed energy generation
without large monopoles, turbines, new infrastructure or much visual or
acoustic impact.



         MINIWECS such as those in Figures A and B at left
demonstrate rooftop turbines for non-residential and mixed-use buildings.
Figure A is a horizontal "aeroturbine" that lays on rooftops. Such turbines
usually require a minimum amount of rooftop square footage to obtain the
necessary capacity. They also need open spaces that are not blocked by
rooftop mechanicals, parapets or other potential wind obstructions. Large,
wide and tall rooftops are appropriate locations for these. Figure B is a
stand-up roof-mounted turbine that extends higher than the roofline. This
turbine is more adaptable as it can be raised vertically to access wind above
any potential obstructions.



         MINIWECS can also on occasion be freestanding re- newable
energy systems as depicted in Figure C.



         Mixed-use districts are often diverse areas that can
accommodate infrastructure that is typically not found in single-use
districts. In Figure C, the monopole stands among mixed-use and multi-family
residential structures.



         Figures D and E demonstrate concepts to utilize existing
vertical infrastructure for MINIWECS distribution. Mounted on parking lot or
street light poles, MINIWECS can take advantage of height and wide-open
spaces. Such infrastructure can offset the energy used to light parking lots
or streets at night or to generate power to sell back to the utility and
reduce peak energy demand.



         In some cases, existing light poles may not structurally
accommodate wind turbines. Such light poles will have to be re-built to
accommodate the extra height and wind loads associated with turbines. The
re-built systems would be MINIWECS with parking lot or street lights rather
than street lights with MINIWECS. Such a conversion would be a co-location
since the new infrastructure would replace similar infrastructure.







 



      3.   SWECS. Small Scale Wind Energy Conversion Systems (10 kW
to 100 kW) can be accessory uses. They are free standing towers and are
permitted via a site plan and elevation review in the E-1 and VC- for
institutional uses only and BIZ, COR, MFG and ORI zoning districts, subject
to these regulations. A special use is required when a SWECS is within five
hundred (500') feet of a residential use. All residential uses within 500
feet must be notified.



         a.   Height.  The  maximum  height  of  a  SWECS 
shall  not  exceed  one-hundred twenty (120') feet to the top of the rotor
blade. The Development Services De-



         SWECS are more intense than MINIWECS. They are intended for
a higher capacity of energy output. SWECS tend to be larger in scale and can
often be incorporated into site plans and building designs. In Figures F and
G, below left, SWECS with parallel rotation to the ground are spread across
parking lots and green spaces.



         In Figure H, below, an onsite SWEC is shown in the more
familiar and traditional wind turbine appearance. SWECS like these are
typically associ- ated with a higher rated energy output. These sys- tems are
for onsite energy production and are usu- ally net-metered with the utility.
They are not rec- ommended in dense settings. Appropriate locations for such
SWECS are in MFG or ORI districts where there is an industrial scope and
scale.



         SWECS like Figures F and G are recommended in more
commercial areas and open places like, park- ing lots, plazas, and common
areas.







 







      4.   UWECS. Utility Scale Wind Energy Conversions Systems (100
kW to 1.5 MW) are free standing utility-owned towers and permitted via
special use in the MFG and ORI zoning districts, subject to these
regulations. UWECS may locate with a special use within one- hundred fifty
feet (150') of Interstate 80. UWECS are not permitted in OS, OOH, E-1, R-1,
R-2, R-2A, R-3, R-3A, R-4, VC, BIZ, and COR zoning districts or within five
hundred (500') feet of a residential use.



         a.   Height. The maximum height of a UWECS shall not
exceed 200 feet from ground level to the top of the rotor blade. The
Development Services Department may grant additional height subject to the
findings of a wind energy analysis.



         UWECS are intended only for utility companies like ComEd.
UWECS are the familiar wind turbines that are often found in farmlands or in
distant locations. They are most recognizable when grouped together in
clusters that can stretch from a few acres to multiple square miles. These
are known as wind farms (as seen at right).



         There are only a few areas that may be suitable for a UWECS
in Orland Park and they must lo- cate near transmission lines to be effective.



         UWECS are not permitted to locate within 500 feet of
residential uses due to their scale. Height is often determined by
surrounding obstructions and prevailing wind patterns. The height of these
turbines, however, is often no greater than some existing wireless
communication/ cell towers, water towers and radio antennas.



         Setbacks from specific land uses typically mitigate visual
and acoustic impacts of turbines. They tend to be no more of a nuisance than
wireless communication towers.







      5.   General Requirements.



         a.   Setbacks. A WECS must be located a minimum distance
equal to 1.1 times the total height from any property line in a
non-residential zoning district. In a residential zoning district, a WECS
must locate according to the established building setbacks and cannot locate
between the front or corner side building façade and the street.



         b.   Spacing Parameters and Wind Accessibility. The
following are spacing parameters and requirements for freestanding WECS
towers and co-located WECS equipment.



            1.   A WECS tower must be located a minimum
distance of twenty (20) feet from any principal structure(s) on a parcel.



            2.   Co-located WECS equipment must be located a
minimum distance of five (5) rotor lengths from non-WECS mechanical,
electronic, telecom- munication or other equipment on a tower, building or
other structure.



            3.   Multiple WECS on a site must be spaced a
minimum distance equal to five (5) rotor lengths, based upon the size of the
largest rotor, from adjacent WECS.







 



Figure 6-314.D.6: Five rotor lengths. This general diagram depicts a rotor
length measured as the length of the blade plus the diameter of the nacelle
or nose of the turbine. This type of measurement should be used for all wind
turbine types.



         c.   Safety. The following are minimum safety
requirements for WECS.



            1.   All WECS must have a manual and automatic
braking system device capable of halting operation to prevent damage in high
winds.



            2.   For freestanding towers, the structural
engineer shall prescribe at a minimum two (2) 5/8 inch diameter ground rods
installed to a depth of eight (8) feet.



            3.   Non-RESWECS must be designed to withstand a
minimum wind velocity of one hundred (100) miles per hour, with an impact
pressure of forty (40) pounds per square foot.



            4.   All WECS structures including towers,
buildings and their related foundations, footings, anchors and electrical
connections must meet the requirements of the Village Building Code and be
engineered by a licensed structural engineer and meet all necessary
engineering code related requirements.



            5.   The minimum distance between the ground and
any protruding blades utilized on a WECS shall be twenty (20') feet as
measured at the lowest point of the arc of the blades.



            6.   Wind turbines must meet the most recent AWEA
Small Wind Turbine Performance and Safety Standards and the International
Electrotechnical Commission IED 61400 standards. Turbines must be certified
by the Small Wind Certification Council or other certification program recog-
nized by the American Wind Energy Association.



               d.   Security. All WECS ground equipment
(e.g. batteries, boxes etc.) shall be en closed  within a lockable six (6)
foot high fence enclosure constructed of either wood or non-white vinyl
material, or in a masonry utility building. All climbing apparatuses affixed
to a WECS must terminate twelve (12) feet above the ground.



               e.   Electromagnetic Interference. No WECS
shall cause electromagnetic degradation or radio frequency interference in
performance of other electromagnetic radiators or receptors of quality and
proper design.



                  1.   The determination of degradation
of performance, quality and proper design shall be made in accordance with
best engineering practices as defined in the latest principles and standards
of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), the Institute of
Radio Engineers (IRE) and Electrical Industries Association (EIA). In case of
conflict between these standards, precedence is given to the AIEE.



                  2.   WECS shall use non-metallic rotor
blades unless documentation is supplied from an appropriate testing
laboratory certifying that a proposed metallic blade rotor will not cause
electromagnetic interference.



                  3.   Any ordinance that grants a WECS
operation, whether special use or otherwise, may be repealed or revoked
whenever electromagnetic interference from a WECS is evident.



               f.   Interconnectivity and Transmission.
SWECS and UWECS may connect to the electric transmission grid using the
public right-of-way following the neces- sary permission from ComEd and
compliance with the Village Code. Transmis- sion conduits/lines providing
connections to the grid or to buildings/batteries must be installed
underground. RESWECS and MINIWECS shall provide power to the property on
which it is located and shall not be used for the sale of energy to other
users offsite. Excess power generated by these may be sold to the grid. ComEd
shall determine grid interconnection and net metering policies. Trans-
mission lines and appurtenances may locate on public right-of-way or on any
other real property provided the necessary licenses, easements, leases,
rights- of-way or other similar land rights for access and maintenance are
obtained.



               g.   Sounds and Vibrations. A WECS shall be
installed and operated such that sound pressure levels do not exceed the
definitions of nuisance "noise" and "vibrations" as established by the
Village Code. During short term events such as storms and utility outages,
when WECS equipment can potentially create nuisance "noise" and "vibrations",
a WECS may exceed the Village Code nuisance requirements if it cannot be
manually shut down by the owner. In the event a full battery bank is causing
a WECS to exceed Code noise and vibration requirements, the WECS must be shut
off until the battery bank is depleted.



               h.   Decommissioning. The Village, through
proper legal procedures, may require the owner of a non-residential WECS or
owner of the land where the non- residential WECS is located to remove the
WECS upon occurrence of any of the following events:



                  1.   The WECS was not constructed in
accordance with the Village require- ments;



                  2.   The WECS has deteriorated from
lack of maintenance;



                  3.   The WECS has been inactive for a
period of at least six months and shall be considered abandoned;



                  4.   The WECS creates irresolvable
electromagnetic interference;



                  The Village shall be authorized to remove
a WECS when the above events oc- cur and when the WECS owner and/ or the land
owner do not comply with these regulations. The WECS and all associated and
ancillary equipment, batteries, devices, structures or supports for that
system will be removed at the owner's and/or land owner's expense and the
costs of removal shall be a lien against the property.



         i.   Letter of Credit or Other Security Method. SWECS
and UWECS will require a letter of credit or other security method to assure
for the proper construction of public improvements associated with the WECS.
The letter of credit or other security method is determined according to
Section 5-112 of these regulations.



         j.   Signage, Lights, Colors and Other Advertisements.
No letters, insignia, logos, flags, banners, balloons, ribbons, tinsel,
streamers, pennants, reflectors, spinners or signs shall be affixed to a
WECS. WECS shall not be lit and commercial lighting fixtures shall not be
attached. WECS shall be painted white, gray or another non-reflective,
unobtrusive color. The only advertising sign permitted on the WECS shall be a
manufacturer's label, not exceeding one square foot in size.







Far Left: WECS signage that identifies manufacturer in a small area per code
requirements.



Left: WECS signage that is not permitted per the Land Development Code.



         k.   Historic Preservation. WECS permitted in OOH or on
Orland Park Landmarks require a Certificate of Appropriateness per Sections
5-110 and 6-209 in addition to any other required approvals, prior to
submission of a building permit.



         l.   Test WECS. A Test WECS is permitted following a
site plan and elevation review at Plan Commission and with formal approval by
the corporate authorities of the Village. Test WECS must be dismantled within
three (3) years of installation and are subject to the requirements of
Section 6-314.D.12. For the purposes of this Section, Test WECS are trial
SWECS and UWECS that are designed solely to collect wind generation data and
are subject to these regulations. RESWECS and MINIWECS are not permitted to
have Test WECS status.



         m.   Aviation Rules and Regulations. The proposed WECS
must be in compliance with all Federal Aviation Administration regulations
and shall comply with the notification requirements of the FAA.







WECS are adaptable to the existing environment and can be incorporated into
new developments as functional elements, stylistic statements or innovative
reforms.



   E.   Solar Energy System (SES) Regulations.



      A SES consists of an array of collector panels that is angled
toward the sun and con- tains photovoltaic (PV) or other solar cells (e.g.
solar thermal) that capture solar energy and convert it directly to
electricity or use it to heat/ cool gases, solids or liquids. Typi- cally
installed on rooftops or in large open spaces on the ground, SES energy
output capacities depend on the number of solar collectors or arrays
installed.



      The following regulations apply to the four classes of SES
recognized by the Land De- velopment Code: PV, SLH, SAH and CSPS.







Top Right: Solar panels on a non-residential rooftop; solar roofing on a
single family home; Mixed-use/ multi- family district equipped with solar
panel systems; and solar power panels applied to parking lot lights. Opposite
Top: Wall mounted SES. The far right depicts a solar curtain preserving
transparency with panels.



      1.   Photovoltaic (PV). Photovoltaic solar energy systems are
mounted directly on rooftops, walls or installed on the ground and are
permitted in all the zoning districts via an ECT Review including for
non-residential uses when the SES is wall mounted or visible from a public
right-of-way, subject to these regulations.



         a.   Height. PV collector panels shall not increase the
visual height of a building. In no instance shall any part of the PV extend
beyond the edge of the roof or parapet. PV collector panels on residential
rooftops must be in line with the plane of the roof and shall not be attached
to chimneys. For flat roofs, the system shall be setback such that it is not
visible from the street or neighboring property.



         b.   Rooftop Coverage. No more than seventy-five percent
(75%) of a residential rooftop may be covered by PV collectors or arrays. A
non- residential rooftop may be covered by as many PV collectors or arrays as
may be spatially or structurally feasible.



         c.   Wall Mounted Setbacks and Height. Wall mounted PV
collector panels shall not extend more than five (5') feet from the wall and
shall be a minimum seven (7') feet from the ground.







      2.   Solar  Liquid  Heating  (SLH).   Solar  liquid 
or  water  heating  systems  are mounted on rooftops or installed on the
ground and are permitted in all zoning districts via an ECT Review including
for non-residential uses when the SES is wall mounted or visible from a
public right-of-way, subject to these regulations.



         a.   Height. SLH solar energy systems shall not increase
the visual height of a building. In no instance shall any part of the SLH
extend beyond the edge of the roof or parapet. SLH collector panels on
residential roof- tops must be in line with the plane of the roof and shall
not be attached to chimneys. For flat roofs, the system shall be setback such
that it is not visible from the street or neighboring property.



         b.   Liquid Storage Tank. Upright-standing SLH systems,
where the liquid storage tank is attached to the solar panel, are not
permitted on resi- dential rooftops. Tanks must be detached and stored inside
the build- ing. For non-residential buildings, SLH tanks must be behind a
parapet wall, other rooftop mechanical equipment, or on the ground. Liquid
stor- age tanks on the ground must be screened by landscaping and a fence
enclosure.







SLH systems should be flat on rooftops or walls. Systems with attached tanks
(left) should be aero- dynamic and light-weight. Upright SLH, such as the one
at right, is prohibited



      3.   Solar Air Heating (SAH). Solar air heating systems are
mounted on rooftops or on walls and are permitted in all zoning districts via
an ECT Review including for non-residential uses when the SES is wall mounted
or visible from a public right-of-way, subject to these regulations.



         a.   Height. SAH solar energy systems shall not increase
the visual height of a building. In no instance shall any part of the SAH
extend beyond the edge of the roof or parapet. SAH collector panels on
residential rooftops must be in line with the plane of the roof and shall not
be at- tached to chimneys. For flat roofs, the system shall be setback such
that it is not visible from the street or neighboring property.



         b.   Rooftop  and  Wall  Coverage.   No  more 
than  seventy-five  percent (75%) of a residential rooftop may be covered
by SAH collectors or arrays. A non-residential rooftop may be covered by as
many SAH collectors or arrays as may be spatially or structurally feasible.
No more than forty percent (40%) of a non-residential building wall facing a
public right-of-way, may be covered by SAH collectors or arrays.



         c.   Wall Mounted Setbacks. Wall mounted SAH solar
energy systems shall not extend more than five (5') feet from the wall.







Above: Solar air heating systems attached to the façades of residential
buildings. Light screening is recommended when facing public right-of-ways.
Wall-mounted SAH units should face south for greatest exposure. Below: PV and
SAH on a multi-family, mixed-use building.







      4.   Concentrated Solar Power Systems (CSPS). CSPS are solar
energy systems that collect solar energy in concentrated amounts through the
use of concave collectors, reflectors or other similar arrays or panels with
the intention of concentrating sun light to heat objects, water, gas or other
substance or matter. CSPS are prohibited in the E-1, OL, LSPD, OOH, R-1, R-2,
R-2A, R-3, R-3A, R-4, BIZ, COR, and VC districts. CSPS solar energy systems
are typically rooftop or ground mounted systems that require a special use in
MFG and ORI.



         a.   Height. The maximum height of a CSPS shall not
exceed fifty (50') feet from ground level to the top of the concave
collector. In no instance shall any part of a rooftop CSPS extend beyond the
edge of the roof or parapet.



         b.   Rooftop Coverage. No more than fifty percent (50%)
of a building roof- top may be covered by CSPS collectors or arrays.



         c.   Fire Protection. A CSPS must be registered with the
Village and meet the necessary fire rating and other specifications required
by the Village Building Code and other governing bodies.











Concentrated solar power systems are intended for industrial purposes. CSPS
are not allowed in residential or commercial districts. The intent of this
section is to encourage the use of CSPS technologies in existing industrial
processes for heating or cooling systems or to promote the manufacturing of
such systems in the Village.



      5.   General Requirements.



         a.   Setbacks. A solar energy system must be located
within the established building setback according to the zoning district. A
SES cannot locate between the building façade and the street, unless it is
wall mounted as in the case of a solar awning.



         b.   Solar Access.  A solar energy system, as the sum
of all panels, must be located on a property such that it is not shaded by
buildings, structures or trees of southerly properties by more than fifteen
percent (15%) on the Winter Solstice (December 21) between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
(Winter Solstice Threshold). Southerly properties are properties south of
true east or west that subject an SES property to shade. Solar en- ergy
systems should be sited at the northern most feasible location on a property.







Figure 6-314.E.6: Solar shade during the Winter Solstice (Dec. 21-22) at 12
p.m. noon, where the angle of the sun is 25.1?, "x" is the minimum distance
from buildings or vegetation that will allow 85% solar exposure, and "y" is
the minimum height of the SES that will allow 85% solar exposure. A SES must
be positioned such that only 15% of its surface area is shaded on the Winter
Solstice.



         c.   Solar Access Easement. See Land Development Code
Section 6-404.E.



         d.   Solar Sharing Agreement. A solar sharing agreement
may be pre- pared between property owners to preserve, protect and share
solar energy  access.  Property  owners  may  share  an  SES  under 
mutual terms, conditions and agreements. Such an agreement may include:
optimizing SES solar exposure between properties; relocating SES to access
solar energy; provisions for shared access, transmission and use; and
provisions for expanding the SES to increase capacity for the benefit of both
parties.



         e.   Solar Assurance. These regulations make no
assurance of solar ac- cess other than the provisions of this section. The
petitioner may pro- vide evidence of covenants, easements, agreements or
similar documentation from neighboring property owners providing access to
solar energy for the operation of a SES.



         f.   Lot Coverage. The surface area of a ground mounted
system regardless of the mounted angle shall be calculated as part of the
overall lot coverage. Ground mounted systems shall not constitute more than
two percent (2%) of the allowable lot coverage, or 360 square feet, which-
ever is less.



Ground mounted SES lot coverage is measured by the surface area of the
panels, even if the system stands on a post or pedestal. The surface area
cannot exceed 2% of the lot size (or 360 square feet, whichever is less) and
is counted toward the total permitted lot coverage in the zon- ing district.







Figure 6-314.E.11 (above): Diagram of solar lot coverage in a typical R-3
10,000 square foot lot.







Right: Non-residential lot coverage example. SES carports do not count toward
total lot coverage because the land is already covered by the pavement of the
parking lot.



         g.   Solar Glare and Concentration. SES collector panels
shall be placed such that concentrated solar radiation or glare shall not be
directed onto nearby properties, roadways or public right-of-ways.



         h.   Interconnectivity and Transmission. A SES shall
provide power for the principal and/or accessory use of the property on which
it is located and shall not be used for the generation of power for the sale
of energy to other users. Excess power generated by a SES may, however, be
sold to Commonwealth Edison (ComEd). ComEd shall be contacted to determine
grid interconnection and net metering policies. Cables, wires and other
transmission conduits or lines providing connections to the electric
transmission grid or to buildings or batteries must be installed indoors or
underground when applicable.



         i.   Design and Permitting. The design of the SES shall
conform to applicable in- dustry standards. The necessary building permits
shall be obtained for a SES per the Village Building Code (e.g. electrical,
plumbing, mechanical etc.). All wiring shall comply with the latest
applicable version of the National Electric Code (NEC) as amended by the
Village. See Section 6-314.C for further required information.



         j.   Accessory Use. Solar energy systems are accessory
uses to the primary or principle use on a property in all zoning districts.



         k.   Transparency. Wall-mounted solar energy systems
cannot replace or be substituted for street-level windows, multi-story
windows, clerestory windows or other type of fenestration or transparency.







While south facing walls may receive optimal sunlight for a SES, building
transparency should be preserved as much as possible both at street level and
elsewhere. SES should be installed at the next best locations, particularly
on rooftops or non-fenestrated walls. The image at left demonstrates "solar
awnings" over existing street level windows and doors. The image at right
demonstrates rooftop mounted solar panels, preserving window/ transparent
area on the building façade.



         l.   Decommissioning. The Village, through proper legal
procedures, may require the owner of a non-residential SES or owner of the
land where the non-residential SES is located to remove the SES upon
occurrence of any of the following events:



            1.   The SES was not constructed in accordance
with the Village require- ments;



            2.   The SES has deteriorated from lack of
maintenance;



            3.   The SES has been inactive for a period of at
least six months and shall be considered abandoned;



            4.   The SES creates irresolvable glare, solar
radiation or concentration on neighboring properties;



            The Village shall be authorized to remove a SES when
the above events occur and when the SES owner and/ or the land owner do not
comply with these regulations. The SES will be removed at the owner's and/or
land owner's expense and the costs of removal shall be a lien against the
property.



         m.   Signage, Lights, Colors and Other Advertisements.
No letters, insignia, logos, flags, banners, balloons, ribbons, tinsel,
streamers, pennants, reflectors, spinners, signs or similar materials shall
be affixed to a SES.  SES colors shall be colored to match existing roof
materials (e.g. shingles) or a color that camouflages it with surrounding
building colors. The only advertising sign permitted on the SES shall be a
manufacturer's label, not exceeding one-half square foot in size.



         n.   Historic Preservation. Solar energy systems are
permitted in historic districts as long as they are in line with the plane of
the roof, treated as architectural features, colored to match roof shingles,
or ground mounted. SES permitted in the Old Orland Historic District or on
Orland Park Landmarks require a Certificate of Appropriateness per Sections
5-110 and 6-209 in addition to any other required approvals, prior to
submission of a building permit.







Solar roofs, such as the one at left, can be retro-fitted on historic
buildings such that the SES appear as if they were asphalt shingles. Section
6-209 Old Orland Historic District permits asphalt shingles as an appropriate
roofing materials in the historic district.



   F.   Geothermal Energy System (GES) Regulations.



      A GES is a central renewable heating and cooling exchange system
that uses heat generated beneath the earth's surface to heat or cool
buildings via underground or underwater systems that pump heat energy into a
building or visa versa. Geothermal energy systems use the earth as a heat
source in the winter or a heat sink in the summer.



      The following regulations apply to the small scale GES recognized
by the Land Development Code: GHPS.







 



Above Left: Types of Geothermal Energy Systems. There are four types of GES:
vertical loop systems that reach deep into the earth; horizontal loop systems
that stay near the surface but are below the frost line; slinky loop systems
that maintain a moderate depth and increase the length/ capacity of the
system on a compact lot; pond loop systems that sink geothermal cables into
detention ponds; and open loop systems (not pictured) that are cables in the
ground. Above Right: Demonstration images indicating the use of GES during
winter months (top: using the earth as a heat source) and summer months
(bottom: using the earth as a heat sink).



      1.   Geothermal Heat Pump System (GHPS). Geothermal heat pump
energy systems, or ground source heat pumps, are installed indoors and
underground via a system of looped coils or piping and invisible after
installation and are permitted in all zoning districts via an ECT Review,
subject to these regulations.



         a.   Depth. GHPS loop fields, coils, piping or other
similar and associated underground infrastructure must be below the frost
line. A geotechnical and engineering study is required to determine
appropriateness and depth on a case by case basis.







GHPS Diagram and infrastructure.



         b.   Setbacks. GHPS loop fields, coils, piping or other
similar underground infrastructure shall not encroach into public
right-of-ways, ComEd trans- mission easements and right-of-ways, access
roads, natural gas, fuel and other pipeline easements, floodplains, wildlife
habitats and naviga- ble waters of the United States. GHPS may be built up to
the property line and, upon acquiring a geothermal access easement or similar
agreement, encroach under neighboring properties to acquire an efficient
scale or tonnage for heating and cooling in a building or site. GHPS must
maintain a minimum distance of ten (10') feet from existing storm water,
sewer and water main utilities, and twenty (20') feet from neighboring
buildings or structures (except parking lots).



         c.   Ground Source Subsidence. Geothermal heat pump
systems shall not cause underground subsidence to the subject or neighboring
properties during installation or any time thereafter. Subsidence is the
process of pit or sag formations in the earth's crust due to undermining or
trenching and filling of the surface and sub-surface. Correction of
subsidence is the responsibility of the GHPS owner.



      2.   Irrigated Geothermal Heat Pump Systems. Irrigated
geothermal heat pump systems consist of any system which uses a thermal
exchange using ground water, surface water, heat pipes or tubes and are
installed in and access underground aquifers (ground water) or storm water
detention/ retention basins (surface water) and are permitted in the BIZ,
COR, MFG, ORI, R-4 and VC zoning districts via an ECT Review, subject to
these regulations.



         a.   Depth. Loop fields, coils, pipes or other similar
and associated underground/ underwater infrastructure must be below the frost
line and a minimum of eight (8') feet below the normal water line of a
detention/ retention basin. Also, see Section 6-314.F.1.a.



         b.   Width and Setbacks. Loop fields, coils, piping,
tubing or other similar underwater system shall not extend above the surface
of the normal water line of a storm water detention/ retention basin. Such
systems must maintain a minimum distance of ten (10') feet from existing
storm water infrastructure, such as culverts, and sewer utilities.



         c.   Detention/ Retention Basin Volume Displacement.
Loop fields, coils, pipes or other similar underwater infrastructure shall
not displace the volume of a storm water detention/ retention basin without
providing necessary compensational storage.



      3.   Small Scale Geothermal District Heating. Geothermal
district heating technology may be used in non-residential and multi-family
home developments to heat multiple buildings on a single site, such as office
campuses and condo and town home developments and between building owners.



Left: Renderings that show residential and non- residential applications of
hydrothermal heat pump systems using detention ponds.



 







Above: Pond loop coils prior to being submerged into a pond. Orland Park has
many residential and non- residential detention ponds that can be used as
heat sources and sinks for improved energy efficiency.



      3.   General Requirements.



         a.   Access. A GES shall access the earth's thermal
energy below grade and shall not be visible from the public right-of-way or
neighboring properties. Access to neighboring properties may be granted by
property owners via Geothermal Access Easements and Geothermal Sharing
Agreements.



            1.   Tree Removal. Tree removal for a GES is not
permitted. GES technology  permits  vertical  thermal  systems  that 
can  avoid trees and other planted areas.



         b.   New Construction Mitigation. New construction that
impacts a GES must move the GES to a new location not impacted or bury it
deeper than the impacted depth, subject to these regulations.



         c.   Geothermal Access Easement. See Land Development
Code Section



6-404.F.



         d.   Geothermal Sharing Agreement. A geothermal sharing
agreement may be prepared between property owners to preserve and protect
geothermal energy access. Property owners may share a GES under mutual terms,
conditions and agreements. Such an agreement may include: optimizing GES
field sizes and well depths; provisions for shared access, transmission and
use; provisions for heat and coolant exchange and transmission rates;
relocating a GES; expanding a GES to increase capacity for multi-building
district heating; and provisions for subsidence control.



         e.   Geothermal  Assurance.   These  regulations 
make  no  assurance  of geothermal access other than the provisions of
this section. The petitioner must provide evidence of covenants, easements,
agreements or similar documentation from property owners and neighboring
property owners providing access to geothermal energy or geotechnical studies
indicating feasibility for the operation of a GES.



         f.   Design and Permitting. The design of the GES shall
conform to applicable industry standards. The necessary building permits
shall be obtained for a GES per the Village Building Code (e.g. electrical,
plumbing, mechanical etc.). All wiring and heating components shall comply
with the latest applicable version of the National Electric Code (NEC) and 
the  American Society  of Heating,  Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE) as amended by the Village. See Section 6-314.C for further
required information.



         g.   Accessory Use. Geothermal energy systems are
accessory uses to the primary or principle use on a property or district in
all zoning districts.







Above: Other geothermal options: geothermal use of underground aquifers and
buried geothermal systems.



   G.   Biomass: Waste to Energy Strategies.



      1.   Onsite Commercial Composting. An onsite commercial
composting facility is the portion of a site or facility that is used for
composting of food scrap or food waste and is permitted in non-residential
areas of the BIZ, COR, MFG, ORI and VC zoning districts provided that they do
not locate within 300 feet of a residential property, hospitals, primary and
secondary school properties, and daycare centers.



         a.   Setbacks. Onsite commercial composting facilities
must locate within the established building setbacks within the local zoning
district.



         b.   Enclosure  and  Screening.   Onsite 
commercial  composting  facilities shall be co-located within existing
onsite waste collection enclosures and shall be screened by a fence
constructed of either solid masonry, wooden or non-white vinyl fence
materials and screened by native land- scaping following the requirements of
Section 6-302.D of the Land Development Code. A composting container shall
not exceed the size of the largest waste collection dumpster or container
within the waste col- lection enclosure or an eight (8) yard container
whichever is less.



         c.   Composting Rules.



            1.   All food scrap or food waste must, by the end
of each operating day, be processed and placed into an enclosed vessel in
which air flow and temperature are controlled pursuant to Illinois Pub- lic
Act 096-0418 (415 ILCS 5/3.330).



            2.   All food scrap or food waste must be covered
in a manner that prevents scavenging by birds and animals and that prevents a
visual, odor or other nuisance(s) at all times.



            3.   Onsite commercial composting facilities shall
not be located in storm water detention or stream setbacks.



            4.   Onsite commercial composting facilities must
be flood-proofed.



            5.   A regular schedule of onsite composting
collection must be maintained. Compost cannot remain on site more than one
week.



         d.   Sale of Biomass and Biofuel. Commercial composting
may be sold to biomass and or biofuel energy plants, biomass facilities,
agricultural industries, distributors etc. as a commodity.



SECTION 6-315.   EXTERIOR LIGHTING.



   A.   Purpose.



      1.   Exterior lighting is used to illuminate residential,
commercial, industrial and public uses; parking lots, sidewalks, signs, and
other elements within the Village. When well designed and properly installed,
exterior lighting is very useful in improving visibility and safety,
providing a sense of security, and complementing the character of the
Village. If exterior lighting is not well designed and properly installed it
can be inefficient, cause glare, and create light trespass and sky glow.
Light trespass falling over property lines can illuminate adjacent grounds or
buildings in an objectionable manner. In order to insure that exterior
lighting is well designed with limited impacts on adjacent properties, the
following requirements are set forth to control exterior lighting in both
residential and non-residential zoning districts.



      2.   Standards and Requirements.



         a.   Lighting Classes. The standards and requirements
set forth in the following tables shall regulate and govern the use of,
design of, construction or modification of any lighting system for the
purpose of illuminating exterior areas including, but not limited to, signs,
parking areas, buildings, landscaping, porches, and driveways. Each Lighting
Zone is comprised of and defined by the correlated Land Uses listed in Table

   B.   Regulations & Procedures.



      1.    Regulations .



         a.   All public and private exterior lighting installed
in the Village of Orland Park shall be in conformance with the requirements
established by this Section.



         b.   The installation of, or the additional installation
of, exterior lighting for aesthetic, safety or general purposes, may be
required, as determined by the Development Services Department.



         c.   All exterior lighting must be maintained and kept
in proper working order.



      2.   Procedures.



         a.   Lighting Plan Required. A lighting plan is required
for all non-residential uses in or adjacent to residential zoning districts,
multiple family developments other than duplexes, commercial/retail,
industrial, institutional, and public uses including uses developed by other
units of local government.



            At the time any exterior lighting is installed or
substantially modified, a lighting plan shall be submitted to the Development
Services Department in order to determine whether the requirements of this
Section have been met. A lighting plan shall be required for all special
uses, planned unit developments, and requests for variations from the
standards imposed in this Section.



            Where a lighting plan is required, said plan shall
include the following:



            1.   A site plan showing pole locations, building
mounted lights (e.g. wall-packs), bollard lights with schematic wiring layout
and power source connection;



            2.   Specifications for luminaires and lamp types,
poles, wiring, conduit and appurtenant construction including photographs or
drawings of proposed luminaires. Manufacturer catalog sheets shall be
provided in order to demonstrate specific style/type and dimensions of
equipment;



            3.   Site-specific pole, luminaire, and foundation
details including pole height, height of building mounted lights, mounting
height and height of the luminaire;



            4.   Overall site plan inclusive of a fifty-foot
perimeter which shall include buildings, luminaires and other structures
sufficient to determine the total cutoff angle of all luminaires and their
relationship to abutting parcels;



            5.   Initial Luminaire Lumens of all light sources
proposed;



            6.   Photometric plans that shows the footcandle -
horizontal measurement internal to the site and at the property lines.
(Footcandle - horizontal measurements shall be taken along a horizontal plane
at a height of three and one-half (3.5) feet above the ground. Photometric
plans shall be based on a light loss factor of 1.0.



            7.   Other information and data reasonably
necessary to evaluate the required lighting plan pursuant to the request of
the Development Services Department.



      3.   Measuring Light Levels.



         a.   Metering Equipment. Light levels of both direct and
indirect light shall be measured in footcandles with a direct reading,
portable light meter. Readings shall be taken only after the cell has been
exposed long enough to provide a constant reading.



         b.   Method of Measurement. Footcandle - horizontal
measurements shall be taken along a horizontal plane at a height of three and
one-half (3.5) feet above the ground. If lighting metering levels are
inconclusive on conformance to the above methods, the measurement will be
taken by focusing the metering equipment directly at the light source.



      4.   Exceptions.



         a.   Public Roadway Lighting. Luminaires used for public
roadway illumination by a public transportation agency are exempt from the
requirements of this Section but may be subject to the regulations of
Federal, State or County agencies, or by other intergovernmental agreements.



         b.   Entrance Drive Lighting. Luminaires used for the
sole purpose of illuminating an access drive and other similar uses may be
determined by the Director of Development Services to be exempted from
certain illumination and other standards of the requirements of this Section.



         c.   Emergency Lighting. All temporary emergency
lighting needed by the Police or Fire Departments or other emergency
services, as well as all vehicular luminaires, shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Section.

SECTION 6-404. EASEMENTS.



   A.   Utility Easements.  Easements across lots or centered on rear
or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities and street lighting,
electronic cable, drainage or other public use, and shall be at least ten
(10) feet wide.  Easements shall be laid out so that proper continuity is
provided from lot to lot and from block to block.  Provisions for extensions
of easements to adjacent areas shall be made by the Director of
Engineering.  Utility easements shall not be located in an area designated
as an open space preservation area unless a one (1) foot topographic location
plan is approved by the Development Review Committee which shows all
topography, trees, native vegetation and watercourses as well as the location
of the proposed easements.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



   B.   Storm Water Easement.  Where a development is traversed by a
water course, drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement or
drainage right-of-way shall be provided which conforms substantially with the
lines of such water course, has a width adequate for construction and
maintenance, and which shall not interfere with a designated open space
preservation area. 



   C.   Pedestrian/Bikepath Easement.  Easements containing pedestrian
ways or bikepaths must be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width, in
accordance with Section 6-415, unless otherwise approved by the Director of
Development Services.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   D.   Scenic Corridor Easements.



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of the scenic corridor easement
requirement is to protect natural corridors of land so that they remain
undeveloped on each side of certain roads.  The purpose is also to reduce
traffic noise which may have a deleterious  impact on residents within the
vicinity.  The requirement of scenic corridor easements shall serve to
protect and maintain a rural/suburban atmosphere in certain sections of the
Village and its one and one-half (1 1/2) mile jurisdiction.  The Corridor
will also provide a refuge for native trees, shrubs and prairie plant life
and  an excellent natural buffer between more-developed areas.



      2.   Provisions. 



         a.   A scenic corridor easement shall be depicted on the
final plat of subdivision and shall constitute an easement infavor of the
Village, the terms of which are as follows:  All scenic corridor easements
shall be kept in their natural condition.  All significant natural
vegetation shall be preserved and maintained and shall not be mowed,
cultivated, sprayed or in any way disturbed, either by the Village, the
developer, the owner upon whose lot the easement exists, or any other person,
except vegetation which is unique and harmful to the health and welfare of
the community or property owner, as determined by the Village, may be
excised, controlled and/or destroyed in accordance with the written direction
of the Village.



         b.   Existing woodlands and hedgerows within the scenic
corridor easement perimeter shall not be destroyed or, if no significant
natural vegetation exists and where suitable top soil from road, lake or
other excavation exists, berms may be constructed in accordance with the
written instructions of the Village.  Said instructions shall be prepared in
accordance with the overall Comprehensive Plan of the Village and shall pay
particular attention to the aesthetic aspects of the vicinity in which the
berms are to be located.  These berms, when approved by the Village, shall
be planted with trees and shrubs and native wildflowers and prairie
grasses.  Non-native flowering plants and evergreen trees may be utilized if
approved in writing by the Village.  It is the intent of this subsection (D)
that the vegetation, whether it be native and natural or whether it be
planted in accordance with this subsection, shall constitute a suitable
screen between the development of the lot upon which the scenic corridor
easement exists and the adjacent road right of way to insure that evidence of
human occupancy is minimal.



      3.   Standards.  On all property sought to be subdivided
which is designated as Critical and Sensitive Areas on the Village's
Comprehensive Plan and which lies adjacent to State, County, Township and
Village streets, there shall be a fifty (50) to one hundred (100) foot scenic
corridor easement measured from the right of way, on either side of said
roads.



      4.   Development Plan.  As a condition of approval of a final
plat, a subdivider or developer shall submit a development plan of all scenic
corridor easements, showing the dimensions thereof, the extent and nature of
all significant natural vegetation, both forest and prairie, all berms sought
to be constructed, the amount and size and type of all planting sought to be
installed.  Such plan shall be reviewed by the Director of Development
Services with written comments being forwarded for consideration by the Plan
Commission.  The Plan Commission shall approve, disapprove or suggest
whatever modifications are necessary in keeping with this subsection.  (Amd.
Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   E.   Solar Access Easement



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of a solar access easement is to
protect solar accessibility between parcels of land so that solar
sunlight/energy may be equitably maintained among the owners of all lots in a
development or between owners of adjacent or neighboring lots.  The purpose
is also to promote all feasible means of energy conservation and all feasible
uses of alternative energy sources.  In regards to plant material, the
Village encourages the planting and maintenance of trees and shrubs to create
shading, moderate outdoor temperatures, and provide various economic and
aesthetic benefits.  However, there are certain situations in which the need
for widespread use of alternative energy devices, such as solar collector
panels, requires specific and limited controls on trees and shrubs.



      2.   Solar Access Easement.  A solar access easement may be
recorded on plats of subdivision in accordance with the provisions of Section
5-112, specifically 5-12.G.3.  Dedicated easements for solar access are for
the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall
have the right to receive sunlight across adjacent panels or units in the
subdivision for any SES, as defined by Section 6-314. In establishing such
easements, consideration shall be given to feasibility, contour,
configuration of the parcel to be divided, equitability and cost. Required
easements shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage
of a lot which may be occupied by a building or a structure.



      3.   Standards.  As a condition of approval of a subdivision
map, there may be imposed, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-112
that the developer or subdividing applicant dedicate solar access
easements.  During the development review process, the Development Services
Department and/or the Plan Commission shall specify the following:



         a.   The standards for determining the exact dimensions
and locations of such easements.



         b.   Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other
objects which would obstruct the passage of sunlight through the easement.



         c.   The terms or conditions, if any, under which an
easement may be revised or terminated.



         d.   Solar access easements cannot be recorded against a
property where the permitted development is taller than forty (40') feet or
in the ORI, BIZ, COR and VC zoning districts.



(Ord. 4594 - 10/18/10)



   F.   Geothermal Access Easement



      1.   Purpose.  The purpose of a geothermal access easement is
to protect thermal accessibility between parcels of land so that the earth's
thermal energy may be equitably maintained among the owners of all lots in a
development or between owners of adjacent or neighboring lots.  The purpose
is also to promote all feasible means of energy conservation and all feasible
uses of alternative energy sources.  In regards to district heating, the
Village encourages the utilization of existing geothermal energies to heat
and cool buildings at a district scale such as a new multi-lot subdivision,
to reduce the overall draw on fossil fuels for building heating.  In some
situations, in which geothermal/hydrothermal district heating systems are
involved, development requires specific and limited controls for the
preservation of the system.



      2.   Geothermal District Heating Access Easement.  A
geothermal access easement may be recorded on plats of subdivision in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5-112, specifically 5-112.G.3, for
district heating purposes.  Dedicated easements for geothermal access are
for the purpose of assuring that each parcel or unit in the subdivision shall
have the right to receive geothermal energy across adjacent parcels or units
in the subdivision for any GES, as defined by Section 6-314.  In
establishing such easements, consideration shall be given to feasibility,
contour, configuration of the parcel to be divided, equitability, subsidence
and cost.  Required easements shall not result in reducing allowable
densities or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or a
structure.



      3.   Standards.  As a condition of approval of a subdivision
map, there may be imposed, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-112
that the developer or subdividing applicant dedicate geothermal district
heating access easements. During the development review process, the
Development Services Department and/or the Plan Commission shall specify the
following:



         a.   The standards for determining the exact dimensions
and locations of such easements.



         b.   Any restrictions on vegetation, buildings and other
objects which would regulate proximity to a GES.



         c.   The terms or conditions, if any under which an
easement may be revised or terminated.



(Ord. 4594 - 10/18/10)

         c.   Proposed streets which are in alignment or are a
continuation of existing streets already named shall bear the name of such
existing streets.  A different name shall be used if a street is in the same
alignment, but is discontinuous, unless that street has a numbered name.  No
street names may be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names
of existing streets in the Postal District(s) serving Orland Park.  Names of
local origin are preferred.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         d.   If the tract of land proposed to be developed, or
any part thereof lies adjacent to a highway over which the Department of
Transportation of the State of Illinois, or the Counties of Cook and Will
have jurisdiction with respect to maintenance and upkeep thereof and an
entrance or entrances are desired from such highway to lots, streets, roadway
or alleys in the proposed development, the developer shall submit a written
permit application to the appropriate jurisdiction granting permission to
construct such an entrance or entrances after preliminary plan approval by
the Village Board.  The developer shall obtain the written permission from
the Village and all other appropriate jurisdictions for all required
permits.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94)



         e.   Proposed developments that are adjacent to existing
development shall be designed to accept the alignment and corresponding
widths of existing pavements. The Village Engineer shall determine the proper
adjustment where the widenings merge with the existing narrow pavement at the
boundary of the property, and shall require the lanes to be painted to
designate driving and parking lanes.



         f.   All street intersections and confluences must
encourage safe traffic flow.



         g.   The minimum standards for a street system based on
functional design criteria shall conform to those set forth in Table
6-405(A)(2).



         h.   Turn lanes.  The need for turn lanes shall be
determined by a traffic study commissioned by the developer or as determined
by Village staff.  The traffic study shall use established standards of the
American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
(Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         i.   Stub streets.  Stub streets shall provide
continuity between adjoining subdivisions, and shall not exceed  1,000 feet
in length.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         j.   Perimeter streets.  If it is determined that a
perimeter street is necessary, it shall be designed thirty (30) feet in
width, back-to-back of curb.  Minimum right-of-way on the perimeter street
shall be forty-six (46) feet.  The street shall be constructed with a
fifteen (15) foot parkway on the side of the street where development will be
taking place.  Upon development of the adjacent parcel, the adjacent
developer will contribute an additional fourteen (14) feet of right-of-way
along the perimeter street.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         k.   Access control standards.  No more than one access
on each major or minor arterial will be permitted unless a traffic study
indicates that additional access points are necessary.  The access point
will be located, if possible, a minimum of two hundred (200) feet from the
nearest intersection and the nearest curb cut.  Shared access should be
considered between adjacent parcels.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         l.   Transit design standards.  Developments located
near existing or planned commuter train stations and bus routes shall be
designed in such a manner as to encourage pedestrian and bicycle linkage to
these facilities.  Pace Development Guidelines may be used as a resource for
developments located along fixed route bus lines.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



         m.   Cross-Access.  Connections between adjacent
developments shall be provided to facilitate traffic at locations determined
by Village staff.          (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



      4.   Alley Design Criteria.  Alleys may be required in
business, office and research, and industrial districts unless provisions are
made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading and parking,
consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. Public alleys shall be
prohibited in residential areas except where topographic or other conditions
may necessitate their use.  The minimum width of an alley right-of-way shall
not be less than twenty-five (25) feet.  The minimum alley pavement width
shall be twenty (20) feet. Dead end alleys are prohibited.



      5.   Cul-De-Sac Design Criteria.   Each cul-de sac shall have
a terminus of nearly circular shape with a minimum right-of-way diameter of
120 feet (Table 6-405 (A) (2). Each cul-de-sac, in single-family residence

   B.   Pavements.



      1.   General.  The arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade and location of all streets to be dedicated to the public, all parking
lots, and all private streets shall be compatible and complimentary to
existing and planned streets, to reasonable circulation of traffic within any
development and adjoining lands, to topographical conditions, to runoff of
storm water, to public convenience and safety, and in their relations to the
proposed uses of the area to be served.  All traffic intersections and
confluences must encourage safe and efficient traffic flow.



      2.   Design References.  All pavements shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the following references as they apply:



         a.   "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction," Illinois Department of Trans-portation, latest edition.

      4.   Pavement Construction Design. All new streets, public or
private, shall be improved and con-structed with pavement that complies with
the requirements of this Section as follows:



         a.   Subgrade. All subgrade material shall have a
minimum Illinois Bearing Ratio (IBR) of 3.0.  All unsuitable subgrade
material, including subgrade material having an IBR less than 3.0, shall be
removed and replaced with a suitable fill material, or the pavement must be
designed to compensate for the soil condition.  The soil support IBR values
selected for use by the engineer shall represent a minimum value for the soil
to be used.  Soil tests must be provided to verify suitability of subgrade
material.



         b.   Pavement Design. The pavement design standards
shall conform to those set forth in Table 6-405(B)(4), Table of Pavement
Design.  A copy of all design assumptions and compu-tations on which the
proposed pavement design is based shall be submitted to and accepted by the
Village Engineer. 



         c.   Composite Pavement Strength.



            1.   The pavement shall be designed and
constructed so as to obtain a fifteen (15) year service life with only
minimal maintenance before a resurfacing is required.



            2.   Prior to the installation of the bituminous
surface course, but after the installation of the binder course, the
developer shall notify the Village Engineer that he intends to surface the
street.  The Village Engineer may obtain a Dynaflect Pavement Evaluation
Program Report of the completed pavement improvements at developer's expense.



            3.   The Dynaflect Pavement Evaluation Program
shall be performed according to the Dynaflect Pavement Evaluation
Specification on file in the office of the Village Engineer.  The program
shall generally embody the following testing/pavement evaluation techniques:



               a.   Environmental study (frost cycle,
drainage, etc.).



               b.   Pavement surface evaluation.



               c.   Soil borings at approximately one
location per mile.



               d.   Dynamic pavement deflection analysis
(Dynaflect machine or equal corre-lated with Benkelman beam or equal).



            4.   The program shall evaluate the existing
condition of the base and binder course in maximum two hundred (200) foot
sections, and shall determine whether or not the pavement section with the
addition of the surface course of design thickness will be projected to meet
a fifteen (15) year pavement life or greater.



            5.   If the pavement section is projected to meet
a life expectancy of fifteen (15) years or more, then the developer may
proceed as indicated in Subsection 11(d) and 11(e).



            6.   If the pavement section is not projected to
meet a life expectancy of fifteen (15) years or more, then the report shall
propose asphalt overlays in excess of the surface course design thickness or
pavement reconstruction to bring the new pavement section to a fifteen year
life expectancy.  The Village Engineer shall evaluate the results of the
report and shall inform the developer of any required pavement repair for
each section.  These repairs shall be completed before the final surface is
applied.



            7.   The Dynaflect Pavement Evaluation Program
shall not be considered valid unless the wearing service was applied during
the same construction season.  Any costs of additional Dynaflect Pavement
Evaluation shall be paid in advance by the developer.



            8.   In the case of rigid pavements, the developer
shall notify the Village Engineer that he is ready for final inspection on
the streets.  The Village Engineer will obtain a Dynaflect Pavement
Evaluation Program report of the complete improvements as outlined in
Subsection B(4)(c) above.



            9.   The program shall evaluate the existing
condition of the pavement in two hundred (200) foot sections and shall
determine whether or not the pavement section will be projected to meet a
fifteen year pavement life or greater.



            10.   If the pavement section is projected to meet
a life expectancy of fifteen (15) years or more, then the developer will be
so notified.



            11.   If the pavement section is not projected to
meet a life expectancy of fifteen (15) years or more, then the report shall
propose pavement reconstruction to bring the new pavement section to a
fifteen (15) year life expectancy.  The Village Engineer shall evaluate the
results of the report and shall inform the developer of any required pavement
repair for each section.



      5.   Pavement Construction Materials.  Pavement materials
approved for street construction shall comply with the minimum requirements
as tabulated in Table 6-405(B)(5), Table of Approved Street Pavement
Construction Materials.  Coefficients to be used for computing the pavement
structural number are listed with these materials.  The coefficients will
yield the structural number when they are multiplied by the thickness of the
materials (measured in inches).

rolled in accordance with SSR & BC, Section 200.  Embankment shall be placed
and compacted in accordance with SSR & BC, Section 207.



         b.   At least one Standard Proctor Density Test,
performed in accordance with AASHTO T99,  shall be taken in each embankment
section, with the maximum distance between tests of three hundred (300)
feet.  One standard proctor density test shall be taken from each different
source of borrowed material.  The density tests must be submitted for review
to the Village Engineer.  Upon review of these tests, an inspection of the
subgrade shall be made by the engineer and a report of acceptable subgrade
and preparation must be submitted to the Village Engineer prior to placing
any curb and gutter or base material.



      7.   Grading.



         a.   Gradients of streets shall be a minimum of one (1)
percent where possible and in no case less than seven-tenths (0.7) percent
and shall not exceed seven (7) percent, unless approved by the Village. 
Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface drainage of storm
water regardless of the presence of storm sewer facilities.



         b.   Where the grade of the street warrants installation
of vertical type curb and other special design of improvements because of
right-of-way conditions, such as double inlets, the Village Engineer is
authorized to require such design.



         c.   The minimum length of vertical curves shall be one
hundred (100) feet for one and one half (1.5) percent difference of grade. 
For each additional one (1.0) percent difference in grade over one and
one-half (1.5) percent, a fifty (50) foot increment shall be added to the
length of a vertical curve.  If the grade differential is less than one and
one-half (1.5) percent, a vertical curve is not required.



      8.   Sight Distances.  At points of intersection of proposed
roads with existing roads, the minimum stopping sight distance indicated
below for the legal speed limits shall be provided on existing roads.  Clear
visibility, at any point of movement along the road measured along the center
line of the street, shall be provided for at least three hundred fifty (350)
feet on all major streets, two hundred (200) feet on collector and local
streets, or as designated by an engineering study.

*If the Village Engineer determines that the projected future legal speed
limit established in accordance with the State of Illinois "Policy for
Establishing and Posting Speed Limits" is higher than the existing legal
speed limit, the higher speed limit shall be used to determine the minimum
stopping sight distance.



      9.   Curb and Gutter.



         a.   Combination curb and gutter shall be constructed on
both sides of all street pavements and shall comply with the requirements of
Construction Standards Governing Public Improvements, as adopted by the
Village Engineer, and as updated from time to time.



         b.   Two (2) No. 4 reinforcing bars shall be placed
continuously between expansion joints.  Expansion joints shall be doweled
and spaced no more than sixty (60) feet on center and at tangent points of
all radii.  Control joints shall be provided at least fifteen (15) feet on
center and shall consist of an actual saw cut, at least one and one-half (1
1/2) inches deep.  If curb machines are used, doweled sections are not
required.



         c.   Curbs installed by slip joint machines shall be
allowed.



         d.   Flow testing:  Before final pavement surface is
installed, the contractor shall run water down the curb lines to check for
"low" and "high" spots that may impede storm water flow.  The Village shall
verify flow line acceptance prior to final acceptance of roads.  Curb
replacement shall be required at all standing water locations.



         e.   Unless otherwise directed by the Village Engineer
pursuant to IDOT standards, a barrier curb, as denoted as Type 3 on Exhibit
No. STR-04, shall be provided on all major streets.  All other streets shall
be provided with curbs as denoted as on Exhibit No. STR-03. Depressed curbs
shall be provided at all bikepath and sidewalk crossings.  Materials shall
comply with those specified in Section 6-406.

***Thickness shall be rounded up to the nearest one-half (1/2) inch.



         b.   Flexible pavement materials can be used until
November 1, weather permitting. Any work done after November 1, shall require
written  authorization from the Village Engineer.  Such authorization, if
obtained, will not void the contractor's and the developer's guarantee on the
work done.



         c.   Flexible pavements must set for a minimum of nine
(9) months, including a winter and a spring.  After this setting period has
passed, one pavement core per nine hundred (900) lineal feet of measured
pavement must be taken.  A report must be submitted to the Village Engineer
that lists the thicknesses of base and binder courses and the type and
condition of subgrade material as determined from the cores.  If the results
of the cores indicate pavement deficiencies, additional cores will be needed
at intervals required by the Village Engineer.  All cores taken shall be
numbered and delivered to the Village Engineer.



         d.   Upon receipt of the report and cores, the Village
Engineer will review the report and will perform an inspection of the
existing base and binder courses.  All base and binder course failures will
then be repaired to the Village Engineer's satisfaction.



         e.   Upon completion of all construction within any
development, the Village Engineer will conduct a deflection test as specified
in Subsection 4(c) above.  All deficiencies outlined in the report shall be
repaired as specified in the report and to the Village Engineer's
satisfaction prior to the installation of the final surface course.



   C.   Traffic Signals.  The need for traffic signals will be
determined by a traffic study commissioned by the developer or as determined
the Village staff.  The traffic study shall use established standards of the
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), and the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  (Ord. 2570 -
5/2/94)



   D.   Emergency Vehicle Access.  Emergency vehicles access shall
conform to the codes of the appropriate Fire District.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



   E.   Fire Lanes.  Fire lanes shall conform to the codes of the
appropriate Fire District.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94)



   F.   Exhibits .  Exhibits labelled STR-01 through STR-04 are
typical specifications of street standards that shall be applied to any
improvements required by these regulations.  (Copies are available at the
Engineering Department).  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



   G.   Street Identification Signs .



      1.   The developer/property owner shall submit the list of
street names approved by the Village Engineer and a map for the installation
of street identification signs immediately after the approval of engineering
drawings.



      2.   The Village shall order signs and mounting hardware in
accordance with its present design standards.  Identifications signs shall
be installed as soon as work schedules and weather conditions permit after
all the signs and mounting hardware are reserved.  Signs shall not be
installed until the first lift of pavement and street light poles are
installed. (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



      3.   The Village shall invoice the contractor an amount equal
to the cost of the signs and mounting hardware plus twenty-five percent (25%)
for handling and installation of the signs.  The developer/property owner
shall make payment in full to the Village within thirty (30) days of the date
of the invoice.



(Ord. 4880 - 2/3/14)



SECTION 6-406.   SIDEWALKS, DRIVEWAYS, AND PARKING LOTS.



   A.   Sidewalks.



      1.   General.  Sidewalks shall be constructed by developers/
property owners along all roads, except as otherwise provided in section
6-406.  If a road is planned for widening within five (5) years of the date
of final development approval, the developer/property owner shall provide
security for sidewalk construction with the Village.  All developments shall
provide a sidewalk to connect buildings with public sidewalks, and must
feature landscaping, benches and other such materials/facilities for no less
than 50 percent of its length. (Ord.2959 - 11/18/96)



      2.   Public Roads.



         a.   Sidewalks on both sides of a roadway shall be
required for all arterial, collector and local streets in the Village of
Orland Park. Sidewalks shall delineate the parkway of a right-of-way and
shall be at a minimum five (5) feet in width with eight (8) feet of planting
strip between the sidewalk and the roadway's back of curb. In the VC Village
Center District and OOH Old Orland Historic District and those areas
comprising the Downtown Planning District of the Comprehensive Plan (except
for residential single family homes attached and detached), sidewalks may
extend from building frontage to back of curb, respecting building setback
requirements and may replace bufferyard requirements with appropriate
applications of street trees (spaced according to parkway standards) and
planter beds, as determined via an approved landscape plan, without variance
to Section 6-305 Landscape and Tree Preservation.  (Amd. Ord. 5061 - 1/18/16)



         b.   Multi-use paths, such as bicycle paths, shall
replace sidewalks in those areas of the Village indicated by the
Comprehensive Plan's Recommended Bikeway System subject to review by the
Development Services Department. Multi-use paths shall use IDOT standards in
IDOT or County rights-of-way or be a minimum of eight (8) feet wide with a
maximum of four (4) feet of planting strip between the path and the roadway's
back of curb. In cases where paths terminate, provisions shall be made to
loop the sidewalk and multi-use path network. In cases where the network is
divided between off-street paths and on-street routes, provisions shall be
made to safely transition from either medium and ensure continuity of travel.



         c.   Sidewalks or multi-use paths as identified by the
Comprehensive Plan's Recommended Bikeway System, as reviewed by the
Development Services Department, shall be required for arterial and collector
rights-of-way on the perimeter of subdivisions or developments (e.g.
sidewalks on roadways where the backs of properties front the right-of-way).



         d.   Either sidewalks or multi-use paths per the
Comprehensive Plan's Recommended Bikeway System are required on both sides of
any roadway within a 1/4  mile radius of a school, park or public building,
subject to review by the Development Services Department.



         e.   New streets shall have sidewalks or multi-use paths
per the Comprehensive Plan's Recommended Bikeway System on both sides of the
right-of-way. When one side presents grade challenges or other development
challenges that inhibit sidewalks or paths, such as the requirement for
retaining walls, provisions shall be made to loop the sidewalk or path that
would dead-end to the existing network (e.g. cross the street via signed and
marked crosswalks and connect).  For new streets that connect to existing
streets with sidewalks or paths on one side of the right-of-way, provisions
shall be made to loop the sidewalk that would dead-end on the new street to
the network (e.g. cross the street via signed and marked crosswalks and
connect).



         f.   Sidewalks and multi-use paths per the Comprehensive
Plan's Recommended Bikeway System, as reviewed by the Development Services
Department, are required for streets and rights-of-way that are below
standard widths. Such streets and rights-of-way shall be subject to review by
the Development Services Department and shall consider such options as
carriage walks, reduced parkways, bike lanes, woonerfs etc. to accommodate
pedestrian and cyclist mobility. (Ord. 4880 - 2/3/14)



      3.   Private Roads.  The same sidewalk standards are required
for private roads as for public roads, unless other design guidelines are
applied for planned developments.



      4.   Location.  The location of sidewalks shall generally be
one (1) foot inside of the right-of-way.  The location may be modified,
depending on factors that include but are not limited to: relationship to
drainage ditches, easements, Commonwealth Edison right-of-ways and towers,
handicapped ramps, existing trees and landscaping, and topography.



      5.   Construction. Sidewalk width shall be a minimum of five
(5) feet in width, subject to Village Engineer approval.  Thickness shall be
a minimum of five (5) inches reinforced with 6" x 6" wire mesh, or other
reinforcement methods subject to approval of the Village Engineer.  All
sidewalks at curb depressions shall include a detectable warning for the
vision impaired consisting of truncated domes.  The warning area shall begin
six (6) inches from the back of the curb and continue two (2) feet in the
direction of pedestrian travel for the entire width of the waking surface. 
The detectable warning shall also present a contrast in color from the
adjacent sidewalk with integrally colored concrete or other means subject to
Village Engineer approval. (Ord. 3130 - 5/18/98; Amd. Ord. 4125 - 4/17/06)



   B.   Driveways and Driveway Aprons.



      1.   Driveways Across Sidewalks and Parkways.   No person,
firm or corporation shall construct or alter any driveway over, across or
upon any public sidewalk or parkway without first obtaining a permit from the
Building Division.  Where ingress and egress is to be made from adjoining
real estate to a public street and where Section 6-306 requires off-street
parking, such off-street parking shall be made accessible to the public
street and the ingress and egress shall be made across the parkway and
sidewalks by means of a driveway constructed in accordance with this Section.



      2.   Permit Application.  Application for a permit to
construct a driveway shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and filed
with the Building Department.  The application shall designate the location
of the proposed driveway, the name and address of the applicant, the name and
address of the owner of the property to be served by the proposed driveway,
and the address of the applicant, if other than the owner, and a plat of
survey indicating the driveway location and sizes proposed.  In those
instances where a driveway is required to comply with the requirements of
Section 6-306, the permit application shall accompany the application for the
issuance of a building permit authorizing the new building construction. 



      3.   Permit Issuance and Fees.   The Building Department
shall issue a permit to construct a driveway provided that the permit
application is complete and is in accordance with these regulations and that
the permit fee has been paid.



      4.   Permit Revocation.  All permits for driveways issued
pursuant to this Section may be revoked at any time without the consent of
the permittee by order of the Board of Trustees and the Director of the
Building Department.  Upon such revocation, all rights granted under the
permit shall be revoked, and the sidewalk, space, parkways and curbs shall be
restored to their former condition, at the expense of the permittee or of the
owner of the property served by the driveway at the time of such revocation.



      5.   Maximum Number.  Single family residences shall be
permitted to have only one (1) driveway per lot except if the lot has a
minimum lot frontage of ninety (90) feet, then a circular driveway consisting
of two (2) drives may be allowed.  All other uses shall be allowed the
number of driveways as approved by the Board of Trustees upon recommendation
of the Building Department.  Any single family lot which has a driveway
exiting on to an arterial or major collector street shall have a turn-around
driveway. (Ord. 3130 - 5/18/98)



      6.   Widths and Lengths. Single-family residential driveways
and driveway aprons shall have a maximum width of twenty (20) feet for one
(1) car garages, twenty-six (26) feet for two (2) car garages, and thirty-six
(36) feet for three (3) car garages. The maximum width of a driveway is
applicable to the entire driveway length between the building line and
sidewalk. The maximum width of a driveway apron is applicable to the entire

the cable shall be long enough for the splices to be withdrawn 18 inches from
the pole handhole. All electric cable and cable unit duct shall be buried at
a minimum depth of 30 inches below finished grade.



      5.   Splicing Of 600 Volt Cable and Wire (In Light Standard).
This specification covers splicing of insulated electric cable and wire.
Compliance with the ASTM Standards is required, as cited by the ASTM
Designation Number.



      6.   Taped Splices. Taped Splices are only allowed with prior
approval from the Village Engineer, or his designee. A taped splice shall
mean a splice of pigtail construction made with a spring connector, rubber
tape, and plastic/vinyl tape according to the following descriptions and
construction methods:



         a.   Connector. The spring connectors shall be made of
spring steel and zinc plated, or similar corrosion-resistant coating. The
connectors shall employ the expandable spring principle and shall insure
positive mechanical and electrical connection under all temperature and load
conditions.



         b.   Rubber Tape. The rubber tape shall be of 0.75 inch
width and 0.030 inch thickness, ASTM D119 compliant.

allowed.



   G.   Vibratory Plowing. The cable duct shall be directly buried by a
vibratory plowing method to a minimum depth of 30 inches. Cable unit duct
shall not be buried in excess of 48 inches.



      1.   Directional Boring: All directional boring must be in
accordance with IDOT Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction,
Sections 810 and 1088.



   H.   Granular Trench Backfill. At locations indicated by the Village
Engineer or designee, a trench shall be constructed to accommodate the cable
duct or unit. The trench shall be backfilled with granular material in
accordance with Section 810 of the IDOT Standard Specification for Road and
Bridge Construction, latest edition. The contractor or developer shall
furnish the trench backfill material and shall appropriately dispose of all
surplus backfill material.



   I.   Construction Methods. The trench shall be excavated to a depth
no less than 30 inches and no greater than 48 inches, in a manner that
prevents cave-in. Excavated material shall be withdrawn and placed a
sufficient distance away to prevent excavated material from reentering the
trench. The trench width shall be at least six inches. Where the cable duct
enters the foundation or a rigid steel conduit, the bottom of the trench
shall be shaped so as to provide a smooth directional run of the cable duct.



      a.   The cable duct shall be placed in the bottom of the
trench only after all existing loose granular material has been removed, and
the trench area has been bedded with granular backfill material, as directed
by the Village Engineer or designee.



      b.   The trench shall be backfilled by placing granular
material in uniform layers no greater than six inches in depth (loose
un-compacted measure). The granular material in each deposited layer shall be
thoroughly in such a manner as to avoid damage to the cable duct and/or
wiring.



      c.   No granular material greater than two inches maximum
dimension shall be allowed in any layer of the backfill placement.



      d.   No sod, frozen material, or any foreign material which,
by decay or otherwise, would cause settlement, shall be placed as backfill
material. Undesirable "naturally occurring" materials such as, but not
limited to, topsoil, clay lumps, broken concrete, shall not exceed five
percent (5%) by weight in any one sample of backfill material.



      e.   Any material excavated from the trench may be used as
backfill provided it does not conflict with the above, and the material is
approved by the Village Engineer or designee. However, if the material in
question has been excavated from the roadway area, replacement material must
be granular trench backfill regardless of what material has been excavated
from the trench.



   J.   Acceptance of Street Lighting System.



      1.   Once the street lighting system has been initially
installed according to the specifications set forth in this Section, the
Village Engineer or designee shall, upon the request of the developer,
inspect the system and prepare a list of items for repair (punch list)
(commonly referred to as a "punch list"). The punch list shall be provided to
the developer or their designee. When the appropriate repairs have been made,
the Village shall accept the lighting system for luminaire maintenance only.
The developer remains responsible for the lighting system and shall therefore
be responsible for any damage due to construction, including cable hits and
pole knock-downs. The Village shall accept the lighting system when the
development is formally accepted in letter form, as written by the Director
of Development Services or designee.



      2.   During the punch list creation, the Village shall
recognize that one splice on each cable is necessary between the light
standard and the connection to the Commonwealth Edison electrical system.
This splice is allowed as a result of cable cutting associated with the
construction of the electrical system. If the cable has been cut for other
reasons (e.g. accidental cable hit) and thereby requires more than one splice
per cable run, the cable and duct shall be replaced in its entirety from the
Commonwealth Edison disconnect pedestal to the light standard, or from the
Commonwealth Edison disconnect pedestal, or transformer, to the lighting
controller.

SECTION 6-408. SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.



   A.   General.



      1.   All development, whether public or private, shall include
provisions for the construction of sanitary sewers and appurtenances designed
in accordance with this Section.  Developers shall use either the public
sewer system or an alternative sewer system, certified by the agency or
municipality with jurisdictional authority, provided that the development is
proximate to a transmission line that has adequate capacity to handle such
proposed development.



      2.   All sanitary sewer improvements shall be installed in
accordance with the material installation and testing requirements of the
"Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois,"
Sixth Edition July 2009, unless otherwise modified in this Section. Sanitary
sewer improvements shall conform to all applicable requirements of the
current Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago
(MWRDGC) Watershed Management Ordinance (WMO).



   B.   Service Areas.  All sewers shall be designed to accommodate an
ultimate service area as defined by the Village Board of Trustees.



   C.   System Extension.  The size and location of proposed
extensions to the existing sanitary sewer system shall be as approved by the
Village Engineer.



   D.   Basic Design Standards.



      1.   Design Flows.



         a.   Design flows for single and multiple residential
development shall be based upon full development of the service area with the
population served, estimated as follows:



 

Type of Dwelling Unit

   The maximum daily per capita design flow shall be calculated using the
formula:



            The maximum daily per capita design flow shall be
calculated using the formula:



               Q=500(P) 1/5



            Where Q* = maximum design flow, in gallons per capita
per day (gpcpd)



            P  = population served, in thousands



            *Not to exceed 400 gpcpd or be less than 250 gpcpd



            For undeveloped residential areas where the details
of future developments are not known, design population (P) per acre may be
estimated by the Village Engineer.



         b.   Design flows for non-residential developments shall
be based on full development of service area with the maximum daily per
capita design flow calculated as follows:

*    Quantities are exclusive of process water requirements which must be
estimated and added.



         For non-residential developments where the details of the
development are not established, domestic design flows may be estimated by
the Village Engineer.  Such flow estimate shall not relieve the owner or
developer of the responsibility to provide adequate sanitary sewer capacity
in order to meet any and all future requirements within the development.



      2.   Sewer Design Hydraulics.



         a.   Sanitary gravity sewer mains shall be designed to
provide design flow capacity, without surcharging, using typical Manning's
formula:



                  Q = (A) 1.486 (R)2/3 (S)1/2



                       n



            Where Q= design flow in units of cubic feet per
second (cfs)



               A= area in units of square feet



               R= hydraulic radius in units of feet



               S= slope in units of feet per foot
(dimensionless)



               n= roughness coefficient, independent on
conduit material



         b.   Roughness coefficient utilized shall be as follows:



            1.   Concrete pipe - 0.013



            2.   Ductile iron - 0.014



            3.   Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) - 0.009



         c.   Design mean velocity, flowing full, shall not be
less than two (2) feet per second or greater than fifteen (15) feet per
second.



         d.   Design flow shall include total allowable
infiltration at any point based on one hundred (100) gallons per inch of
diameter of sewer per mile per twenty-four (24) day at any time for any
section of the system.



         e.   Minimum and maximum design slopes are found in Part
F.3 and are per the MWRDGC WMO.



      3.   Minimum Sewer Size.



         a.   Minimum sanitary sewer main size shall be eight (8)
inch diameter.



         b.   Minimum building sanitary service sewer size shall
be six (6) inch diameter.



      4.   Alignment.  Sewers shall be laid straight in both
horizontal and vertical planes between manholes, unless otherwise approved by
the Village Engineer.



      5.   Sewer Size Changes.  Sanitary sewers of different
diameters shall join only at manholes.  The invert elevations shall be
adjusted to maintain a uniform energy gradient by matching the 0.8 depth
points of different diameters.



      6.   Sanitary Sewer Manholes.



         a.   Manholes shall be provided at the following
locations:



            1.   Termination of existing and future lines



            2.   Changes in direction, horizontal or vertical



            3.   Changes in shape or pipe size



            4.   Junctions with other sewers



            5.   Maximum manhole spacing shall be 400 feet.



         b.   Where possible, sanitary sewer facilities shall be
designed to avoid the use of a drop manhole. A drop manhole shall be provided
for manholes with any pipe having a difference in invert elevation more than
seventy-two (72) inches above the invert of the sewers leaving such manholes.
Small drops may be used in the event of utility conflicts, where approved by
the Village Engineer. The invert of the outlet pipe from a drop pipe must
match the springline elevation of the precast manhole bench. All drop
manholes must be precast with monolithic drop pipe assemblies.



         c.   Where flows and other conditions dictate, special
manholes or junction chambers shall be designed and constructed.



         d.   All manholes shall have a precast base.



      7.   Sewer Depth.  Sanitary sewers shall be constructed at a
minimum depth of eight (8) feet and shall provide an outfall for all sanitary
sewage within the existing and future ultimate service area, unless approved
by the Village Engineer. The eight foot depth is intended to eliminate the
service line separation deficiencies which commonly occur between sanitary
sewer placed at six feet deep and water mains at five feet deep.



      8.   Lift Stations.



         a.   Whenever possible, sanitary sewerage facilities
shall be appropriately designed per this Code section so as to avoid the
necessity of providing lift stations.



         b.   Lift station and force main designs shall be
submitted for review and approval to the Village Engineer, the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District of Greater Chicago.



         c.   Lift stations shall be of the single wet well type
utilizing submersible pumps, and shall be comparable to other recently
constructed lift stations within the service area of the Village.



         d.   A stand-by internal combustion power source shall
be provided for lift stations. The power source shall be natural gas-fueled
for output rating less than 100 kW and shall be diesel-fueled for 100 kW and
above.



            As an alternate, the Village Engineer may allow a
dual connection to the power system as a method of providing stand-by power
in cases where such an alternate would provide an equal degree of
reliability, and also would provide an economy to the Village over the
service life of the alternate stand-by power system.



            All stand-by power sources must be installed within a
weatherproof building structure suitable to accommodate the power source,
controls, alarm system and all other required appurtenances.  The structure
must be large enough to allow for servicing of all equipment and must meet
all Village building codes.



         e.   Force mains shall be designed and constructed of
epoxy-lined ductile iron pipe or PVC pressure pipe ASTM 2241-SDR 21. A tracer
wire shall accompany all force main piping installations for the purpose of
future locating with an electronic locating device. A pipeline marker shall
be installed above the force main every 400 feet and at horizontal bends in
the pipe. The tracer wire shall terminate in an enclosure (typically a
pipeline marker) with sufficient wire slack for connecting to an electronic
locating device.



         f.   A compatible telemetered alarm system shall be
installed and connected to the Village's existing computerized reporting and
alarm panel.



         g.   The force main wet well shall be epoxy-lined after
installation of the well structure itself and associated piping.



      9.   Sewer Pipe Class.  Sewer pipe class shall be determined
by using ASTM rigid and flexible pipe design strength formulas.



      10.   Sewer Pipe Bedding.



         a.   Sewer pipe bedding shall, as a minimum, conform to
the requirements established in Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer
Construction in Illinois, July 2009, and/or latest revision.



         b.   Sewer pipe concrete cradle, arch, or full
encasement shall be constructed whenever dictated by trench or embankment
conditions as directed by the Village Engineer.



   E.   Material Specifications.  All sanitary sewer system elements
shall conform to the following specifications:



      1.   Sewer and Service Connection Pipe.



         a.   Reinforced concrete pipe - circular reinforcement,
minimum Class 3, ASTM C76, with epoxy lining, 18" diameter and larger.

   G.   Protection of Water Mains.   Water mains shall be protected in
accordance with the applicable Illinois Pollution Control Board Regulations
and the Illinois Environmental Protec-tion Agency, Division of Public Water
Supplies, Technical Policy Statements.  Wherever the sanitary sewer main,
building service sewer, or any storm drain crosses a water main, a minimum
eighteen (18) inches vertical separation shall be provided between the top of
the lower pipe and the bottom of the upper pipe.  If an eighteen (18) inch
vertical separation cannot be maintained, the sanitary or storm sewer shall
be constructed of watermain quality pipe, for a minimum distance of ten (10)
feet on each side of the water main.  If storm or sanitary sewer crosses
above a watermain and an 18" clearance cannot be maintained, both sewer and
water pipes must be of the same pipe material as the watermain.



   H.   Sewers in Relation to Streams.



      1.   Location of Sewers on Streams.



         a.   Cover Depth.  The top of all sewers entering or
crossing streams shall be at a sufficient depth below the natural bottom of
the stream bed to protect the sewer line.  In general, the following cover
requirements shall be met:



            1.   One (1) foot of cover is required where the
sewer is located in rock.



            2.   Three (3) feet of cover is required in other
material.  In major streams, more than three feet of cover may be required.



            3.   In paved stream channels, the top of the
sewer line should be placed one (1) foot below the bottom of the channel
pavement.  Concrete encasement may be required.



   Note:      Less cover will be approved only if the proposed sewer
crossing will not interfere with the future improvements to the channel
stream.



         b.   Horizontal Location.  Sewers located along streams
shall be located outside of the stream bed and sufficiently separated from
the stream bank to provide for future remediation and to prevent siltation
pollution during construction.



         c.   Structures.  The sewer outfalls, headwalls,
manholes, gate boxes, or other structures shall be located so they do not
interfere with the free discharge of flood flows of the stream. Watertight
covers per Section 6-408.E.6.c shall be required for manholes set at
elevations below flood hazard elevations.



         d.   Alignment.  Sewers crossing streams should be
designed to cross the stream as nearly perpendicular to the stream flow as
possible and shall be designed without change in grade.  Sewer systems shall
be designed to minimize the number of stream crossings.



      2.   Construction Requirements.



         a.   Materials and Backfill.  Sewers entering or
crossing streams shall be constructed of calcium aluminate cement lined
ductile iron pipe with mechanical joints; otherwise they shall be constructed
so they will remain watertight and free from changes in alignment and
grade.  The backfill used in the trench shall be coarse aggregate, gravel,
or other materials which will not cause siltation, pipe damage during
placement, or chemical corrosion in place.



         b.   Siltation and Erosion.  Construction methods that
will minimize siltation and erosion shall be employed as stated in Land
Development Code article 6-411 Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control.  The
design engineer shall include in the project specifications the methods to be
employed in the construction of sewers in or near streams to provide adequate
control of siltation and erosion.



      3.   Aerial Crossings.



         a.   Structural Support.  Support for all joints shall
be provided in pipes utilized in aerial crossings.  The supports shall be
designed to prevent frost heave, overturning and settlement.



         b.   Freeze and Expansion Protection.   Protection
against freezing shall be provided.  This may be accomplished through the
use of insulation, and increased slope expansion jointing shall be provided
between the aerial and buried sections of the sewer line.



         c.   Flood Clearance.  For aerial stream crossings the
impact of flood waters and debris shall be considered.  The bottom of the
pipe should be placed no lower than the elevation of the 100 year (1% annual
chance of occurrence) flood.



      4.   Inverted Siphons.  Inverted siphons shall have not less
than two (2) barrels with a minimum pipe size of six (6) inches and shall be
provided with the necessary appurtenances for convenient flushing and
maintenance.  The inlet and outlet structures shall have adequate clearances
for cleaning, sufficient head shall be provided and pipe sizes shall be
selected to ensure velocities of at least three (3) ft/sec. for average
flows.  The inlet and outlet structures shall be designed so that normal
flow is diverted to one (1) barrel such that either barrel may be taken out
of service for cleaning.



   I.   Handling of Pipe.  Sanitary sewer pipe shall be handled in a
manner that will prevent damage prior to installation.  Damaged or defective
material on the job site shall be rejected and replaced to the satisfaction
of the Village Engineer.  Methods of construction conducive to the damage of
sewer pipe shall be corrected when called to the attention of the
contractor.  All pipe and fittings shall be examined by the contractor above
grade before placement in the trench.



   J.   Laying of Pipe.



      1.   Sanitary Sewer Pipe.  Sanitary sewer pipe shall be laid
true to line and grade as set forth in the Standard Specifications for Water
and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, Sixth Edition (July 2009), and/or
latest revision.  Dirt or other foreign material shall be prevented from
entering the pipe or pipe joint during handling or laying operations and any
pipe or fitting that has been installed with dirt or foreign material in it
shall be removed, cleaned, and relaid.  At times when pipe laying is not in
progress, the open end of the installed pipe shall be closed with a water
tight plug or by other means approved by the Village Engineer to ensure
absolute cleanliness and avoidance of extraneous flows inside the pipe.



      2.   Laying of Pipe on Curves.  The curvature of sanitary
sewers is not allowed unless, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, special
circumstances dictate otherwise.  Pipe required to be laid on curved
alignment shall be joined in straight alignment and then deflected, joint by
joint.  Special care shall be taken in blocking the pipe, and in no case
shall the degree of deflection exceed the manufacturer's recommendations for
the respective pipe size, material and barrel length.



      3.   Sanitary Sewer Services.  (Sanitary Service Riser SS-05
and SS-05-20):



         Sanitary sewer services shall be a minimum of six (6)
inches in diameter and connected to the sewer main with a manufactured wye at
a minimum angle of thirty (30) degrees and a maximum angle of forty-five (45)
degrees.  Sanitary sewer services shall be extended to the property line or
building at a minimum gradient of one (1) percent.  Sanitary sewer service
connections to sewer mains twelve (12) feet or more in depth shall be
constructed with a six (6) inch tee and riser and backfilled with select
granular material or encased in concrete at the option of the Village
Engineer.  On a temporary basis, sanitary services may be terminated with a
manufactured plug in which case the location shall be staked and an accurate
record kept of the stub distance from the nearest downstream manhole along
the sewer main.  Sanitary sewer service connections to existing sewer mains
shall be made with a dedicated tapping machine and the saddle shall be
tightly secured to the existing sanitary sewer.



      4.   Depth of Pipe Cover. All pipe shall be laid to a minimum
depth of eight (8) feet measured from the proposed ground surface to the top
of the pipe barrel unless specifically allowed otherwise under special
circumstances by the Village Engineer.



      5.   Pipe Bedding. (Trench Section Sanitary Sewer Detail No.
SS-06). Crushed gravel or crushed stone - ASTM C33. The only gradation
allowed shall be 100% retained on a 3/8" sieve and 100% passing 3/4" sieve.
Granular pipe bedding material or granular cradle shall be required on all
sanitary sewers installed in the Village. Granular pipe bedding shall be a
minimum of four (4) inches in earth excavation and a minimum of six (6)
inches in rock excavation. The trench shall be backfilled with granular
material to six (6) inches over the top of the pipe. The granular material
shall conform in gradation to Type B, of the Standard Specifications for
Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, Sixth Edition (July 2009)
and/or latest revision.



      6.   Selection of Granular Backfill. All trenches for sanitary
sewers falling under and within two feet of a proposed or existing paved
surface shall be backfilled with select granular material conforming to only
gradation Types A or B as listed in the Standard Specifications for Water and
Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, Sixth Edition (July 2009) and/or latest
revision. Selected granular backfill shall be placed in uniform layers not
exceeding six (6) inches (loose measure) and compacted with mechanical
equipment to 90% of maximum density in accordance with AASHTO-99.



   K.   Installation Requirements.



      1.   No connection of any section of new sanitary sewer to an
existing Village sanitary sewer is allowed until the Village approves the new
sewer(s) for service.



      2.   Sewer system design and construction shall in all
respects be in accordance with the regulations of the MWRDGC and the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency.  No construction shall commence until
evidence of the approved permits from these agencies is filed with the
Village Engineer.



      3.   The installation of sanitary sewer and appurtenances
shall conform to the requirements of this Section and the following:



         a.   Reinforced concrete pipe - Standard Specifications
for Water and Sewer Main Construction in Illinois, Sixth Edition (July 2009)
and/or latest revision.



         b.   Ductile iron pipe and fittings - AWWA C600



         c.   PVC pipe and fittings - ASTM D-2321



      4.   The installation of sewer service connections shall
conform to the requirements of this Section .



      5.   Where the installation of a grease separator is required,
the basin shall be exterior to the building where possible. However, should
the establishment prefer to have an internal grease basin, it will be allowed
if ample basin capacity can be provided. Basin capacity shall be dictated by
applicable plumbing code(s).



      6.   The contractor shall keep a record of the location of all
sewer services by measurement to the nearest downstream manhole.  Such
records shall be delivered to the Village Engineer at the completion of the
work.



   L.   Inspection and Test.



      1.   Cleaning.  All sewers and appurtenances shall be high
pressure cleaned prior to inspection and testing required by this Section.



      2.   Visual Inspection.



         a.   All sewer and appurtenances shall be visually
inspected by representatives of the developer during and following
construction.



         b.   Sewers designed to be straight between manholes
will be tested for straightness by flashing a light from manhole to manhole,
lamping or by other suitable means.



      3.   T.V. Inspections.



         a.   Upon completion of construction and prior to
initiation of the maintenance guarantee period, a T.V. inspection shall be
performed.  Video and a written report of all television inspections shall
be provided to the Village prior to the initial acceptance provided for by
this Section.  The form of the report and video format shall be approved by
the Village Engineer.



         b.   Fees and costs connected with T.V. inspections
shall be paid for by the developer or owner.



         c.   All dips, cracks, leaks, improperly sealed joints,
and departures from approved grades and alignment shall be repaired by
removing and replacing the involved sections of pipe and manholes.



         d.   All defects and corrective work required as the
result of T.V. inspection shall be performed by the developer without
delay.  Upon completion thereof, the sewer shall be retested and such
further inspection made as may appear warranted.



      4.   Infiltration Testing.



         a.   It is the intent of this Section to secure a sewer
system with a minimum amount of infiltration.  The maximum allowable
infiltration shall not exceed one hundred (100) gallons per inch of diameter
of sewer per mile per twenty-four (24) hour day at any time for any section
of the system.  The joints shall be tight and any joint with visible leakage
or leakage in excess of that specified above, shall be repaired at the
developer's expense.



         b.   The repair must be of a permanent nature and of a
quality equal to new construction in conformance with the applicable
specifications.



         c.   Immediately after backfilling, the entire length of
the sewer trench, including stubs, shall be inundated to normal ground water
level or eighteen (18) inches above the top of sewer pipe, whichever is
higher.  At that time, infiltration tests shall be made to determine
compliance with the allowable infiltration criteria.  To measure the amount
of infiltration, the contractor shall furnish, install, and maintain a
V-notch shape crested weir in a metal frame tightly secured at the lower end
of each sewer test section as directed by the Village Engineer.  The Village
Engineer shall check the infil-tration by measuring the flow over such
weirs.  When infiltration is demon-strated to be within the allowable
limits, the contractors shall remove such weirs.



      5.   Exfiltration Testing.  If during the construction of the
sewer system, the Village Engineer determines that it is impractical to
obtain a proper infiltration test, then a test for watertightness shall be
made by bulkheading the manhole at the lower end of the section under test
and filling the sewer with water to eighteen (18) inches above the top of the
sewer in the manhole at the upper end of the section.  Leakage will then be
calculated as the measured amount of water added to maintain the above
described level at a maximum allowable exfiltration rate of one hundred (100)
gallons per inch of diameter of sewer per mile per twenty-four (24) hour day
at any time for any section of the system.



      6.   Air Testing.  All Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Polyvinyl
Chloride Molecularly Oriented Pressure Pipe (PVCO) will require low pressure
air testing meeting ASTM F1417. The Village Engineer may require air testing
for other pipe materials in accordance with ASTM C828.



      7.   Deflection Testing.



         a.   All Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) and Polyvinyl Chloride
Molecularly Oriented Pressure Pipe (PVCO) require deflection testing. The 5%
deflection test for pipe sizes six (6) to fifteen (15) inches in diameter is
to be run using a nine-arm mandrel having a diameter equal to 95% of the base
diameter of the pipe as established in ASTM D-3034. For pipe sizes eighteen
(18) to twenty-seven (27) inches in diameter, the nine-arm mandrel size shall
be 95% of the inside diameter and wall thickness dimensions shown in Table 1
of ASTM F-679, latest issue. The test shall be performed without mechanically
pulling devices.



         b.   The individual lines to be tested shall be so
tested no sooner than 30 days after they have been installed.



         c.   Wherever possible and practical, the testing shall
initiate at the downstream lines and proceed towards the upstream lines.



         d.   No pipe shall exceed a deflection of 5%. Where
deflection is found to be in excess of 5% of the original pipe diameter, the
contractor shall excavate to the point of excess deflection and carefully
compact around the point where excess deflection was found. The line shall
then be retested for deflection. If the deflected pipe fails to return to the
original size (inside diameter) after the second test, the line shall be
replaced accordingly to the standards set forth in this Section.



   M.   Exhibits.  Standard Detail Exhibits labeled SS-01, SS-02,
SS-03, SS-04, SS-05, SS-05-20, SS-06 and PC-01 are typical specifications of
Village sanitary sewer standards that shall be applied to any improvements
required by these regulations.



   N.   Acceptance of Sanitary Sewer System.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94)



      1.   Once the sanitary sewer system has been completed
according to the specifications set forth in this Section, the Development
Services Department shall, upon the request of the developer, inspect the
system and prepare a list of items for repair (punch list).  The list shall
be sent to the developer and when repairs have been made, the Village shall
accept the system for operational use only.  During the time after the
acceptance by the Village for maintenance, the developer shall be responsible
for any deficiencies identified within the system, including but not limited
to sewer blockages, adjustment to manhole frames and leaking joints.  Upon
reaching approximately eighty (80) percent development of building
construction, the Development Services Department will reinspect the sanitary
sewer system for any existing deficiencies and prepare a list of items for
repair.  The list shall be given or sent to the developer and when the
repairs have been made to the satisfaction of the Village, the system shall
be formally accepted by the Village in letter form sent to the developer.



      2.   All construction shall meet the requirements and
acceptance procedures of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of
Greater Chicago prior to the acceptance by the Village. (Amd. Ord. 5167 
2/20/17)

SECTION 6-409. STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER DETENTION.



(Ord. 3281 - 8/16/99)



   A.   General. 



      1.   All development, whether public or private, shall include
provisions for the construction of storm sewers and appurtenances designed in
accordance with this Section.  Developers shall use either the public sewer
system or an alternative sewer system, certified by an agency or municipality
with jurisdictional authority, provided that the development is proximate to
a transmission line that has adequate capacity to handle such proposed
development.



      2.   All development designated by the Director of Engineering
shall include provisions for storm water holding facilities designed in
accordance with this Section.  The storm water holding facilities should
incorporate multiple uses where practicable.



   The detention (dry pond), retention (wet pond), or depressional storage
areas that are to be used as part of the drainage system for a property shall
be constructed as the first element of the initial earthwork program.  Any
eroded sediment captured in these facilities shall be removed by the
applicant before project completion in order to maintain the design volume of
the facilities.  (Ord. 3837 - 12/1/03)



      3.   Storm sewer systems shall be installed in accordance with
Section 600 of the "Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction," and "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois," latest edition, unless otherwise modified in this
Section.



      4.   Stormwater system designs should be in conformance with
Illinois EPA stormwater permitting requirements.  In particular, a state
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit for
Construction Site Activities is required for land disturbances of five or
more acres.  Permit requirements for a "stormwater pollution prevention
plan" specifically reference the need for stormwater detention, vegetated
swales and natural depressions, infiltration measures, and velocity
dissipation devices to control runoff pollutants and to maintain pre
development hydro logic conditions.



      5.   All dry ponds should be required to have a minimum of a
6" under drain.  (3837 - 12/1/03)



      6.   In wet ponds natural landscaping is required to be
planted at not less than 5 feet wide at the normal water line for a 4:1
slope.  (3837 - 12/1/03)



   B.   Service Areas.  All storm sewers, streams or channels shall be
designed to accommodate all areas which naturally flow to the area of the
development and also any additional areas which are planned to contribute to
the drainage area as identified by the Director of Engineering.  The
drainage areas as designated shall be designed to not adversely impact the
capacity of the downstream system.

any time for any section of the system.



      4.   Natural Stream Channels.  Natural stream channels that
are designated by the Board of Trustees for the Village of Orland Park shall
be retained in lieu of either constructed open channels or enclosed storm
sewer pipes.  Natural stream channels shall be regulated by provisions in
Section 6-411 and Section 6-412 of these regulations.  (Amd. Ord. 5312 
7/16/18)



      5.   Manmade Open Channels.



         a.   Constructed open channels that are not designated
as natural stream channels, and that will be draining an area eighty (80)
acres or larger, may be provided on an optional basis in lieu of an enclosed
storm sewer pipe.



         b.   All constructed open channels that are not
designated as natural stream channels located within a development or located
on public property or easements adjacent to the development and other open
channels within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the development, shall be
improved as follows:



            1.   Maximum slopes shall be six (6) horizontal to
one (1) vertical.



            2.   An eight (8) foot wide bituminous concrete
(IDOT  Class I) pathway, suitable for use by maintenance vehicles, with a
minimum thickness of six (6) inches, shall be constructed a minimum of two
(2) feet above the normal water level.  The far edge of the pathway shall be
a minimum of one (1) foot within the easement running along the open

open channels.



            4.   An easement for drainage, access and
municipal utilities, shall be provided along the open channel with a width
adequate to include the area covered by an one hundred (100) year storm.



      6.   Swales.  All swales shall be sodded and limited to a
maximum water depth of twelve (12) inches. The maximum water depth shall be a
minimum of one foot (1') below the lowest opening of an adjacent foundation
along the flow path.  Maximum side slopes of swales shall not be steeper
than six (6) horizontal to one (1) vertical.



      7.   Alignment.  Sewer shall be laid straight in both
horizontal and vertical planes between manholes, unless otherwise approved by
the Director of Engineering.



      8.   Pipe Design Flows.  Unless otherwise approved by the
Director of Engineering, storm sewer pipes and open channels shall be
designed to carry storm water runoff flows determined by the Rational Method
using the formula: 



            Q = C i A



         Where  Q =  runoff flow in units of cubic feet per second.



            C =  runoff coefficient, characteristic of tributary
drainage area in dimensionless units.



            A =  tributary drainage area in units of acres.



            i =  average rainfall intensity in units of inches
per hour.



         a.   The runoff coefficient, C, is the ratio of runoff
to rainfall and shall be assumed as follows:



            1.   All impervious areas (paved or hard surfaced
areas of all types and buildings, inclusive of, but not limited to, patios,
garage walks, stoned landscaped areas and pools), C shall equal 0.95.



            2.   All pervious areas (all areas not classified
as impervious), C shall equal 0.45.



            3.   All bodies of water (wetlands, lakes,
streams, and depressional storage areas), C shall equal 1.0.



         b.   The runoff coefficient used in design shall be the
weighted average for the  proposed tributary watershed.



         c.   Within a development, the runoff coefficient shall
be computed assuming ultimate develop ment.  Where ultimate development
plans are not available at the time of the design of the storm sewer system,
a runoff coefficient shall be selected by the Director of Engineering, based
on the zoning classification, knowledge of the specific development and the
previous experience of the Village with similar developments. The area within
the watershed, but outside the development, shall be computed for existing
conditions, the runoff coefficient shall be approved by the Director of
Engineering.

maintain a uniform energy gradient by matching the 0.8 depth points of the
different diameter.



      11.   Storm Water Inlets.



         a.   Surface drainage inlets shall be provided so that
surface water is not carried across any street intersections or parking lot
drives.  Surface runoff shall not extend a distance of more than four
hundred (400) feet along the surface of the ground and shall not build up a
flow of more than two (2) cubic feet per  second (with no more than 1.0' of
head) in a ten (10) year storm before being intercepted by drainage inlets. 
Inlets shall discharge into storm sewers which shall not discharge into side
lot or rear lot drainage ditches.  Inlets shall be provided at all low
points.



         b.   Rear yard inlets having a minimum depth of two (2)
feet shall be provided where necessary.



      12.   Storm Sewer Manholes.

500


60 or larger
 
1000



 



         b.   Where flows and other conditions dictate, special
manholes or junction chambers shall be designed and constructed.



      13.   Sewer Depth.  Storm sewers shall be constructed
sufficiently deep so as to prevent freezing and provide an outfall for all
storm water within the ultimate service area, both existing and future.  The
minimum cover shall be three (3) feet.



      14.   Sewer Pipe Class.  Sewer pipe class shall be determined
based upon the specifications of Section 603 of the "Standard Specifications
for Road and Bridge Construction," latest edition.



      15.   Sewer Pipe Bedding.



         a.   Sewer pipe bedding shall, as a minimum, conform to
the requirements shown on Exhibit No. SS 07.



         b.   Sewer pipe concrete cradle, arch, or fill
encasement shall be constructed whenever dictated by trench or embankment
conditions.



      16.   Building Drainage.



         a.   The point of discharge of sump pumps shall be
connected to storm sewer system for each building served, as shown on the
Engineering Plan, unless approved otherwise.  Storm sewer service lines from
that point shall be provided to the storm sewer system.



         b.   Lots shall be graded in such a manner as to cause
positive drainage away from the building to lot line swales or ditches, which
shall merge as quickly as possible and then discharge into a storm sewer. 
The route of flow of storm water away from each building into swales, ditches
and storm sewers to where it leaves the site shall be shown on the
Engineering Plan.



         c.   No lot shall be allowed to divert, modify or change
grade elevation from an approved engineering drawing without approval from
the Director of Engineering.



      17.   Vacant Lot Drainage.  Positive drainage shall be
established for each lot whether or not it is the owner's intention to
construct a building on that lot. 



      18.   Storm Water Detention Facilities.



         a.   Detention Basin (dry pond) Outlet Design: 
Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall
be evaluated when designing the outlet.  (Ord. 3837 - 12/1/03)



         b.   The volume of detention facilities shall be
determined as follows: the  maximum volume of storm water generated by the
100 year frequency storm, less the volume of storm water released through the
outlet pipe at the calculated peak of the 100 year frequency storm.  The
design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on
the runoff from the 100  year, 24 hour event and reservoir routing or
equal.  Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as
described in this section.  The Director of Engineering may designate an
alternative design computation for detention storage.



         c.   The outlet pipe(s) shall be designed to allow a
maximum discharge of no more than 0.15 cubic feet per second per gross acre
of development for a 24 hour 100 year storm event and shall include design to
allow a maximum discharge of no more than 0.04 cubic feet per second per
gross acre of development for a 24 hour 2 year storm event.  Where a single
pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall
have a minimum diameter of 4 inches.  If this minimum size permits release
rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is
not a practical alternative, the Director of Engineering may require an
alternative outlet design which shall utilize self cleaning flow restrictors.
If the receiving storm  system is determined to be unable to accept the
above calculated discharge rate, a lesser discharge rate may be required.



         d.   In order to prevent soil erosion and weed problems,
"dry" detention basins must be landscaped including the establishment of a
groundcover over all unpaved areas through sodding of native natural growth
plant material or material as designated by the Director of Development
Services.  Such groundcover shall not be of a plant type which can be
carried by water plow to aggressively invade other downstream lands or
properties, and crown vetch shall be prohibited.  Native natural plant
growth may comprise a variety of techniques that employ in concert according
to the needs of the site.  Some of these include biologs, aquatic plants,
wattles, natural native grasses, tri lok, and vegetated geogrids.  Detention
Basins shall be designed so that the portion of their bottom area which is
intended to be dry shall have standing water no longer than seventy two (72)
hours for all runoff events less than the 100 year frequency storm.



            If detention facilities are proposed, they shall also
be reviewed by the Director of Recreation and Parks for usability as active
recreational areas during dry weather conditions.  Additional underdraining
may be required.  Pipe runs and spacing shall be designed to ensure good
drainage.  Detention facilities shall be designed so that the cross slope is
at least two (2) percent.  The bottom of the facility shall be provided with
an underdrain (minimum six (6) inch diameter perforated drain tile) covered
on all sides with a minimum of six (6) inches of crushed stone conforming to
ASTM C33, Size No. 67.  The underdrain shall be installed to drain the basin
below grade during periods of low flow and shall connect to a storm sewer
outfall pipe.  Detention facilities shall be designed with side slopes not
steeper than four (4) horizontal to one (1) vertical (4:1). The inflow storm
piping system shall be constructed in such a manner so as to allow for "low"
flows to by pass the basin.  (Ord. 2959  11/18/96;  Amd. Ord. 5167 
2/20/17)



         e.   Permanent retention ponds ("wet basins") shall be
designed in accordance with Exhibit No. STS 13. Native natural plantings are
recommended for  shorelines and banks.  Prior to the construction of the
basin, soil testing must be done to determine the need for a clay or
synthetic liner and to determine the minimum side slopes required to prevent
soil  erosion.  In order to prevent shore erosion and muskrat digging or
denning, a fiber mat or other  acceptable material shall conform to any
applicable State specifications.  The slopes that are inundated by the storm
water levels shall be covered  with this fiber.  Native natural plant
growth is recommended and may comprise a variety of techniques according to
the needs of the site.  Some of these include biologs, aquatic plants,
wattles, natural native grasses, tri lok, and vegetated geogrids.  Ponds
shall have a minimum of four (4) foot horizontal to one (1) foot vertical
side slopes (4:1). All slopes that are 4:1 should be sodded.  Slopes greater
than 4:1 and bottoms of ponds may be hydro-seeded.  Sediment basins are
required in dry ponds.  Access for maintenance purposes should be at least
15 feet wide at the top of the pond property starting at any point above the
high water level.  At the toe of the slope, a twelve (12) foot wide safety
ledge sloped toward the shore at four (4) percent  shall be provided.  See
Exhibit STS 13.  Beyond the safety ledge, the pond bottom shall slope at two
(2) horizontal to one (1) vertical (2:1) down to the pond bottom elevation.
The minimum pond bottom elevation shall be fifteen (15) feet below normal
water level for a minimum of 25% of the surface area.  Points of inflow to
the pond shall be accessible to construction equipment for dredging as
necessary.  If retention facilities are designated for recreational
purposes, appropriate consideration shall be reflected in the design for
maintenance of fish life, boating, and safety.  Wet basin ponds  may be
required to have aeration equipment installed to ensure adequate water
quality.  (Ord.2959  11/18/96; Amd. Ord. 3837 - 12/1/03)



         f.   Detention basins within the floodplain is strongly
discouraged.  However, the stormwater detention requirements of this
ordinance may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe
areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met.



            1.   Detention in Flood Fringe Areas:  The
placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require
compensatory storage for 1.5 times the volume below the base flood elevation
occupied by the detention basin including any berms.  The release from the
detention storage pro vided shall still be controlled consistent with the
requirements of this section.  The applicant shall demonstrate its operation
for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for
compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the
area occupied by detention.  All floodplain storage lost below the ten year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the ten year flood elevation.  All
floodplain storage lost above the existing ten year flood elevation shall be
replaced above the proposed ten year flood elevation.  All compensatory
storage excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.



            2.   On stream Detention:  On stream detention
basins and detention basins located within the regulatory floodways are
discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if
they meet the other provisions of this ordinance with respect to water
quality and control of the two year and 100 year, 24 hour events from the
development.    If on stream detention is used for watersheds larger than
one square mile, a Conditional Letter of Map Amendment approved by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency is required prior to any construction and
a Letter of Map Amendment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is
required prior to any building construction.  The applicant will submit
modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any
properties upstream or downstream of the property.  Also, impoundment of the
stream as part of on stream detention:



               a.   shall not prevent the migration of
indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of
their life cycle, such as for spawning,



               b.   shall not cause or contribute to the
degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat,



               c.   shall include a design calling for
gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre
sedimentation basin,



               d.   shall not involve any stream
channelization or the filling of wetlands,



               e.   shall require the implementation of an
effective nonpoint  source management program throughout the upstream
watershed which shall include at a minimum: runoff reduction BMPs; 2  year
detention/sedimentation basins for all development; and a program to control
nonpoint sources at the source for prior developments constructed without
appropriate stormwater BMPs.



         g.   Methods for Generating Runoff Hydrographs  Runoff
hydrographs shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of
rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture.



            1.   Rainfall:  Unless a continuous simulation
approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design rainfall events
shall be based on the Illinois State Water Survey's Bulletin 70 or 71.  The
first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and
analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or equal to
12 hours.  The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for
the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with
critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours.  The
fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of
systems with durations greater than 24 hours.  The first, third, and fourth
quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in Table 37 of
Bulletin 70.  The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to
the Huff distributions.



            2.   Antecedent Moisture:  Computations of runoff
hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous accounting of antecedent
moisture conditions shall assume a normal antecedent moisture condition (2),
unless otherwise directed by the Director of Engineering.



         h.   Inlet and Outlet Orientation:  To the extent
feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be
maximized.  If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin.



         i.   Wetland and Dry Detention Basin Design:  In
addition to the other requirements of this ordinance, wetland and dry basins
shall be designed to remove stormwater pollutants, to be safe, to be
aesthetically pleasing and as much as feasible to be available for multiple
uses.



            Wetland and dry basins shall be designed so that the
portion of their bottom area which is intended to be dry shall have standing
water no longer than seventy two hours for all runoff events less than the
100 year event.  Underdrains directed to the outlet may be used to
accomplish this requirement.  Grading plans shall clearly distinguish the
wet/wetland portion of the basin bottom from the dry portion.



         j.   Velocity Dissipation:  Velocity dissipation
measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at
inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.



         k.   Stilling/Sedimentation Basins:  A
stilling/sedimentation basin should be constructed at each major inlet to a
wetland or dry basin.  The volume of the basins should be at least 500 ft3
per acre of impervious surface in the drainage area.  Side slopes of the
basins shall be no steeper than 4 horizontal to 1 vertical and basin depths
should be at least 3 feet to minimize resuspension of accumulated sediment.



         l.   Overflow Structures:  All stormwater detention
basins shall be provided with an overflow structure capable of safely passing
excess flows at a stage at least 1 foot below the lowest founda tion grade in
the vicinity of the detention basin.  The design flow rate of the overflow
structure shall be equivalent to the 100 year inflow rate, or as designated
by the Director of Engineering.



         m.   Stormwater runoff from areas tributary to the
property shall be considered in the design of the property's drainage
system.  Whenever practicable, flows  from upstream areas that are not to
be detained should be routed around the basin being provided for the site
being developed.



            1.   Upstream Areas Not Meeting Ordinance
Requirements  When there are areas not meeting the storage and release rates
of this ordinance, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized
detention on the applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant. 
The following steps shall be followed.



               a.   The applicant shall compute the storage
volume needed for his property using the release rates of this section.



               b.   Areas tributary to the applicant's
property, not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of this

SECTION 6-410. WATER SUPPLY.



(Entire Section Amended  Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



   A.   General.



      1.   All development shall include provisions for the
construction of water distribution facilities complete with valves, fire
hydrants, and other appurtenances designed in accordance with this Section. 
As a minimum, the water distribution system shall provide a service
connection(s) at the approximate mid-point of the front property line of each
individual lot or parcel within the development.  Where more than one
building is located or planned on one lot or parcel of property, or when
water main construction is required on the property for fire protection, the
proposed construction shall also include all water main construction and
appurtenances within the lot or parcel except service lines.



      2.   Specification references made herein for manufactured
materials such as pipe, hydrants, valves and fittings refer to designation of
the American Water Works Association (AWWA) or of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI).  Water distribution systems shall be constructed
in accordance with the "Standard Specifications for Water and Sewer Main
Construction in Illinois," latest edition, unless otherwise modified in this
Section.



   B.   Basic Design Standards.



      1.   System Extension.



         a.   Extension to the water distribution system shall
form a complete network extension or a part of a complete network extension
that includes all primary mains, secondary mains, and gridiron mains,
complementing the existing distribution system network.



         b.   Primary mains are those mains that form the
arterial portion of the system. Primary mains under construction within a
development are further defined as mains that are sixteen (16) inches or
larger.  Primary mains within or adjacent to a development shall be sized
and located in accordance with the Comprehensive Water System Study of the
Village, latest edition. Secondary mains shall be sized, looped, and spaced
as required for fire flows and shall have a minimum diameter of eight (8)
inches.



         c.   Gridiron mains shall form a grid to supply water to
the local fire hydrants and service lines.  Gridiron mains shall have a
minimum diameter of eight (8) inches.  Dead end water mains shall not be
allowed.



         d.   The proposed system extensions shall be arranged so
that the service interruptions caused by a break in any main will be limited
to twenty (20) residential units or one thousand (1000) feet in all
non-residential areas.  The maximum number of valves for a shutdown shall be
three (3); four (4) may be allowed in unique cases with the approval of the
Village.



         e.    Developer shall be required to extend water
distribution system as determined by Village Engineer.



      2.   Maximum Day Consumption.  For purposes of water main
design, maximum day consumption for water main design shall be based on the
following table:

*   Quantities are exclusive of process water requirements which must be
estimated and added.



For other than residential developments, when the details of the development
are not known, maximum day consumption and fire flow may be estimated by the
Village Engineer.  Such estimate shall not relieve the owner or developer of
the responsibility of providing adequate main capacity for any and all future
needs within the development.



      3.   Head Losses.  Head losses in relation to velocity in
water mains shall be computed using the Hazen-Williams formula:



         V = .318 (C)(R)0.63(S)0.54



      Where   V = Velocity, in units of feet per second



         C = 100



         R = Hydraulic radius, in units of feet



         S = Hydraulic gradient, in units of feet per foot



      4.   Main Capacity.  Primary mains, secondary mains, and
gridiron mains shall be sized to provide sufficient capacity to deliver the
required fire flow plus the consumption at the maximum daily rate to all
areas served by the proposed construction.



      5.   Required Fire Flow and Pressure.  A separate fire flow
report shall be prepared that indicates that at selected locations, and at
any other locations that may be selected by the Village Engineer, the fire
flows required, in excess of maximum daily consumptive demands, will be
supplied using a "C" factor of 100, ignoring fittings, and with a minimum
residual hydrant pressure of twenty (20) psi.  Required fire flow shall be
computed as detailed in the "Guide for Determination of Required Fire Flow,"
latest edition, published by the Insurance Service Office.  Watermains shall
be sized and set at grades to provide ISO fire protection flow rates.  The
developer shall bear the cost of the flow studies.  Flow tests are to be
performed to verify compliance w/ the guide.

      3.   Back Flow Prevention.  Back flow prevention devices
should be required in conformance with other applicable Village regulations.



      4.   Water Service Connection Requirements.



         a.   Residential and Commercial.



            1.   Each individual residential unit, except as
noted below in 4.a.2, shall have a separate metered water service to each
unit.  The service line shall be individually tapped into the water main and
extended into the unit without passing through the property of another unit.
Location and placement of wiring conduit shall be determined by the Village
Plumbing Inspector and installed by the contractor.



            2.   Multi-floor residential buildings can be
served by one (1) adequately sized water service line into a meter room. 
Inside the meter room, the service shall be manifolded to accept one (1)
meter per unit served and one (1) meter for any common purpose water use. 
The manifold shall be constructed similarly to a single meter setting with
padlock type valving device as approved by the Village Plumbing Inspector. A
single meter for the entire building may be allowed in unique cases with the
approval of the Director of Development Services and Director of Public Works.



            3.   Commercial, Industrial and Office type
buildings shall be served by one (1) adequately sized water service line into
a meter room. If the units are individually owned (not leased or rented),
inside the meter room, the service shall be manifolded to accept one (1)
meter per unit served and one (1) meter for any common water purpose. The
manifold should be constructed similarly to a single meter setting with
padlock type valving device as approved by the Village Plumbing Inspector. If
the building is singularly owned (units leased or rented) only one (1)
adequately sized meter will be allowed.



            4.   The meter room shall be accessible from a
public area and constructed solely for water meter housing.  A separate
conduit shall be installed by the electrical contractor from each meter to a
common point area on the building exterior.  Location and placement of the
wiring shall be determined by the Village Plumbing Inspector.



   F.   Fire Service Line.  All fire sprinklers shall be connected to
the water system through a single water service line constructed in
accordance with the requirements in this Section and separated inside the
building prior to meter.



   G.   Water Main Protection.  All water main, storm sewer and
sanitary sewer construction shall meet the requirements of this Section.



      1.   Horizontal Separation.



         a.   A water main shall be laid at least ten (10) feet
horizontally from any existing or proposed storm or sanitary sewer line.



         b.   Should local conditions prevail which would prevent
a lateral separation of ten (10) feet, a water main may be laid closer than
ten (10) feet to a storm or sanitary sewer provided the main is laid in a
separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located to one side of the
sewer and at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is a least
eighteen (18) inches above the top of the sewer.  In such cases, water main
shall be laid with as much horizontal clearance for sewer as possible.



         c.   If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and
vertical separation as stipulated in Subsections (a) or (b) above, both the
water main and the length of sewer between adjacent manholes shall be
constructed of push-on or mechanical-joint ductile iron pipe, or pre-stressed
concrete pipe and shall be pressure-tested to assure water tightness before
backfilling.



      2.   Vertical Separation.



         a.   Whenever a water main must cross house sewers,
storm drains, or sanitary sewer, the water main shall be laid at such an
elevation that the bottom of the water main is eighteen (18) inches above the
top of the drain or sewer.  This vertical separation shall be maintained for
that portion of the water main located within ten (10) feet, horizontally, of
any sewer or drain crossed.  Said ten (10) feet is to be measured at the
normal distance from the water main to the drain or sewer.



         b.   Where conditions exist that the minimum vertical
separation set forth in a subsection above cannot be maintained, or it is
necessary for the water main to pass under a sewer or drain, one of the
following two measures must be taken:



            1.   The water main shall be installed within a
PVC carrier pipe and the carrier pipe shall extend on each side of the
crossing until the normal distance from the water main to the sewer or drain
line is at least ten (10) feet.



            2.   The involved sewer or drain shall be
constructed from manhole to manhole with "O" ring pipe conforming to ASTM 361
or other pipe material which would conform to water main standards.



   H.   Construction Requirements.



      1.   Excavation.



         a.   The trench shall be excavated so that the water
main shall have a minimum of five (5) feet six (6) inches of cover.  The
trench for the pipe shall be excavated at least twelve (12) inches wider than
the external diameter of the pipe but not wider than the widths denoted on
Exhibit No. WM-11.



         b.   Bell holes of sufficient depth shall be provided
across the bottom of the trench to accommodate the bell of the pipe, to
provide sufficient room for joint making and to insure uniform bearing for
the pipe.



         c.   Where a firm foundation is not found to exist for
the bottom of the trench at the required depth due to soft, spongy or other
unsuitable soil, such unsuitable soil shall be removed for the full width of
the trench or tunnel and replaced with well compacted unwashed gravel or an
equal substitute, or crushed stone if such compacted material proves
unsatisfactory.  Where rock in either ledge or boulder formation is
encountered, it shall be removed below grade and replaced with a
well-compacted cushion of unwashed gravel having a thickness under the pipe
of not less than eight (8) inches.



      2.   Sheeting and Bracing.



         a.   Sheeting and bracing shall be used in the
excavation area as may be necessary for the safety of the work and the
public, for the protection of the workmen and to prevent damage to adjacent
properties.



         b.   Sheeting shall not be removed until the backfill
has been placed and thoroughly compacted.



      3.   Laying Water Main.



         a.   The contractor shall keep the trench free from
water while the water main is being placed and until the pipe joint has been
sealed to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer.



         b.   Adequate provision shall be made for the safety,
storage and protection of all water pipe prior to actual installation in the
trench.  Care shall be taken to prevent damage to the pipe castings and
coating, both inside and out.  Provisions shall be made to keep the inside
of the pipe clean throughout its storage period and to keep mud and/or other
debris from being deposited therein.  All pipes shall be thoroughly cleaned
on the inside before placement of the pipe.  Proper equipment shall be used
for the safe handling, conveying and laying of the pipe.  All pipes shall be
carefully lowered into the trench, piece by piece, by means of a derrick,
ropes, or other suitable tools or equipment, in such manner as to prevent
damage to water main materials and protective coatings and linings.  Under
no circumstances shall water main materials be dropped or dumped into the
trench.



         c.   In making joints, all portions of the joining
materials and the socket and spigot ends of the joining pipe shall be wiped
clean of all foreign materials.  The actual assembly of the jointing shall
be in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions and/or as
directed by the Village Engineer.  During construction, until jointing
operations are complete, the open ends of all pipes shall be at all times
protected and sealed with temporary watertight plugs.



         d.   Polyvinyl encasement shall be installed around
ductile iron pipe with a minimum overlap of 12" at each joint and sealed with
approved polyvinyl compatible adhesive tape.



      4.   Pipe Cutting.



         a.   The cutting of pipe for inserting valves, fittings
or closure pieces shall be done in a neat and workmanlike manner without
damage to cement lining and so as to leave a smooth end at right angles to
the axis of the pipe.



         b.   When machine cutting is not available for cutting
pipe twenty (20) inches in diameter or larger, the electric-arc cutting
method shall be permitted, using a carbon or steel rod.  Only qualified and
experienced workmen shall be allowed to perform this work.



         c.   The flame cutting of pipe by means of an
oxyacetylene torch shall not be allowed.



      5.   Trench.



         a.   The trench bottom shall be flat and shall provide
full bearing of the length of the pipe.



         b.   Thrust blocks shall be used to prevent movement at
all bends, tees, caps, valves and hydrants.



         c.   Backfilling of the trench shall be accomplished by
careful replacement of the excavated material after the pipe and the bedding
material have been installed.  Any pipe installed within two (2) feet of a
pavement edge or curb and gutter shall be backfilled to the top of the trench
with granular material in compliance with Illinois Department of
Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction.



      6.   Fire Hydrant.



         a.   Fire hydrants shall be placed as specified on
engineering plans.  All hydrants shall stand plumb, their pumper nozzle
pointing normal to the road.  They shall conform to the established grade,
with the breakaway flange being between 1 to 5 inches above finished grade.
All nozzles shall be at sufficient height above finished grade to provide
free rotation of a standard hydrant wrench free and clear of any obstructions.



         b.   A drainage pit two (2) feet in diameter and two (2)
feet deep shall be excavated below each hydrant and filled completely with a
minimum of one cubic yard of 1" river rock under and around the bowl of the
hydrant and to a level six (6) inches above the waste opening.  No hydrant
drainage pit shall be connected to a sewer.



         c.   Hydrant leads are not allowed for extending the
setback unless approved by the Director of Development Services and the
Director of Public Works.



         d.   Barrel extensions shall be provided as needed in
order to provide sufficient height above finished grade to provide free
rotation of a standard hydrant wrench free and clear of any obstructions and
to provide a minimum 18" height above finished grade to the break-a-way
flange.  An extension shall not exceed a maximum of 3 feet.



         e.   Front of hydrant shall be no closer than three (3)
feet to back of curb.



      7.   Water Main Installation.  During water main
installation, to make a closure between two pipe ends, or between pipe end
fittings, or between pipe end and valve, short lengths shall be used with
proper connections or couplings.  Repair sleeves shall not be used to make
closures during new construction.



      8.   Dewatering.  Where water is encountered in the trench,
it shall be removed during pipe-laying and jointing operations.  Trench
water shall not be allowed to enter the pipe at any time.



      9.   Connections to Existing Mains.  All connections to the
Village water distribution system shall be made under full water service
pressure unless otherwise approved by the Director of Development Services
and the Director of Public Works at locations approved by the Director of
Public Works.



   I.   Pressure Test.



      1.   As part of the construction, the water mains shall be
pressure tested in accordance with this Section.



      2.   All newly laid pipes shall be subjected to a hydrostatic
pressure of one hundred fifty (150) pounds per square inch.  Duration of
each pressure test shall be for a period of not less than two (2) hours. 
Each valved section of pipe shall be filled with water and the specified test
pressure shall be applied by means of a pump connected to the pipe.  Before
applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the
pipe.  All leaks shall be repaired until tight.  Any cracked or defective
pipes, fittings, valves, or hydrants discovered in consequence of this
pressure test shall be removed and replaced and the test repeated until
satisfactory results are obtained.



      3.   All testing shall be done before the installation of
service lines.  Suitable means shall be provided for determining the
quantity of water lost by leakage under the specified test pressure. 
Allowable leakage shall not be greater than that computed as follows:



            L = (N) (D) (P)



                      7400



   L =   Allowable leakage in gallons per hour



   N =   number of joints in length of pipeline tested



   D =   Nominal diameter of the pipe in inches



   P =   Average test pressure during leakage test in pounds per square
inch gauge.



Leakage is defined as the quantity of water required to be supplied to the
newly laid pipe necessary to maintain the specified leakage test pressure.



   J.   Preliminary Flushing.  Prior to chlorination, the main shall
be flushed as thoroughly as possible with the water pressure and outlets
available.  Flushing shall be done after the pressure test is made. 
Because such flushing removes only the lighter solids, it cannot be relied
upon to remove heavy material allowed to get into the main during pipe
placement.  If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, a tap should
be provided large enough to affect a velocity in the main of at least two and
one-half (2 1/2) feet per second.



   K.   Disinfection.



      1.   The preferred point of application of the chlorinating
agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved
section of it and through a corporation stop in the top of the newly laid
pipe.  The injector for delivering the chlorine-gas into the pipe should be
supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the
flow into the pipeline extension.



      2.   Water from the existing distribution system or other
source of supply shall be controlled so as to flow slowly into the newly laid
pipeline during the application of chlorine-gas.  The rate of chlorine
mixture flow shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the
pipe that the chlorine dose applied to the water entering the newly laid pipe
shall be at least fifty (50) ppm, or enough to meet the requirements during
the retention period.  This may require as much as one hundred (100) ppm of
chlorine in the water left in the line after chlorination.



      3.   Valves shall be manipulated so that the strong chlorine
solution in the line being treated shall not flow back into the line
supplying the water.



      4.   Treated water shall be retained in the pipe long enough
to destroy all spore-forming bacteria.  This retention period shall be at
least twenty-four (24) hours.  After the chlorine-treated water has been
retained for the required time, the chlorine residual at the pipe extremities
and at other representative points should be at least 25 ppm.



      5.   In the process of chlorinating newly laid pipe, all
valves or other appurtenances shall be operated while the pipeline is filled
with the chlorinating agent.



      6.   All water mains shall be disinfected and tested according
to the requirements of the "Standards for Disinfecting Water Mains," AWWA
C601, and as required by this Section.  All disinfection, as required by
this Section, shall be performed by an independent firm exhibiting experience
in the methods and techniques of this operation, and shall be approved by the
Village Engineer.



   L.   Final Flushing and Testing.



      1.   Following chlorination, all treated water shall be
thoroughly flushed from the newly laid pipeline at its extremities until the
replacement water, throughout its length shall, upon test, be approved as
safe water by the Village Engineer.  This quality of water delivered by the
new main should continue for a period of at least two (2) full days as
demonstrated by laboratory examination of samples taken from a tap located
and installed in such a way as to prevent outside contamination.  Samples
should never be taken from an unsterilized hose or from a fire hydrant
because such samples seldom meet current bacteriological standards.



      2.   After disinfecting and flushing, a minimum of two (2)
water samples shall be collected by the contractor on two successive days,
with notice given, so that the collection may be witnessed by the Village
Engineer.  Bacteriological sampling and analysis of the samples shall be
performed by a laboratory approved by the Illinois Department of Public
Health and the Village Engineer.  Should the initial treatment result in an
unsatisfactory bacterial test, the procedure shall be repeated until
satisfactory results are obtained.  The contractor or developer shall pay
for the sampling and analysis.  Results of the analysis shall be transmitted
by the laboratory directly to the Village Engineer.  Test results shall
indicate the date the sample was collected, the date the analysis was made,
the exact locations at which samples were taken, the firm submitting the
sample, and the project at which the samples were collected.  Sufficient
samples shall be collected in order to insure that the system is
bacteriologically safe.

   N.   Acceptance of Water Supply.



      1.   Once the water supply system has been completed according
to the specifications set forth in this Section, the Director of Public Works
shall, upon the request of the developer, inspect the system and prepare a
list of items for repair (punch list).  The list shall be given or sent to
the developer and when repairs have been made, the Director of Public Works
shall accept the system for operational use only.  During the time after the
acceptance by the Village for maintenance, the developer shall be responsible
for any delinquencies incurred within the system, including but not limited
to water main leaks, adjustment to manhole frames and bent curb boxes.  Upon
reaching approximately eighty (80) percent development of building
construction, the Director of Public Works will re-inspect the water supply
system for any delinquencies which may have occurred and prepare a list of
items for repair.  The list shall be given or sent to the developer and when
the repairs have been made to the satisfaction of the Director of Public
Works, the Director shall accept the system for the Village.  (Ord. 2570 
5/2/94)



      2.   All construction shall meet the requirements and
acceptance by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency prior to the
acceptance by the Director of Public Works.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94)

SECTION 6-411.   SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to conserve the land,
water, air and other natural resources within the Village by establishing
requirements for the control of erosion and sedimentation.  (Amd. Ord. 5312
 7/16/18)



   B.   Objectives. The following guidelines shall apply for the
planning, implementing, monitoring and maintenance of all development
activity within the Village which disturbs stabilized soil allowing erosion
and sedimentation to occur:



      1.   Development shall be related to the topography and soils
of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion.  Areas of steep
slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever
possible, and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible.



      2.   Natural watercourses, existing trees, and conservation
areas shall be retained and protected from erosion and sedimentation so that
natural features and functions are maintained. Areas immediately adjacent to
natural watercourses and which are planned to be left undisturbed shall be
left undisturbed for a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the natural water
course, as measured from the bank of the perennial stream, the centerline of
an intermittent stream, or the ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond, or
twenty-five (25) feet for an artificial detention/retention basin, as
measured from the high water line level, whenever possible, and shall be
governed by the regulations in Section 6-412.



      3.   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for
the shortest practical time during development.  Sediment control measures
shall be installed prior to the commencement of any land disturbance.



      4.   Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or
permanent measures within seven (7) calendar days following the end of
disturbance activities.



      5.   Perimeter protection, sediment basins, debris basins,
desilting basins, or silt traps or filters shall be installed, and shall be
maintained to remove sediment from run-off waters from land undergoing
development and from undeveloped land.



      6.   Provision shall be made to stabilize stormwater
management systems that are functioning throughout construction. Temporary or
permanent stabilization measures shall be installed at time of construction.



      7.   Proper storm sewer inlet and outlet protection shall be
in place and maintained throughout construction until permanent stabilization
of the development has been completed.



      8.   Provisions shall be made for the temporary or permanent
stabilization of soil stockpiles within seven (7) days of placement. 
Perimeter controls shall be placed around the base of the stockpile
immediately.  Stockpiles shall be graded to a safe slope within six (6)
months of deposit. Weeds and other vegetation above eight inches (8") tall
shall be cut back as needed.  (Ord. 2570  5/2/94)



      9.   Provision shall be made for the control of the deposit of
sediment and debris from the development site onto streets, alleys and
sidewalks at the end of each work day, or if a hazardous condition
develops.  (Ord. 2570 - 5/2/94)



      10.   All construction ingress and egress points shall have a
stabilized construction entrance installed and maintained until permanent
stabilization of the development has been completed.



      11.   Sediment filtering devices shall be used for all
dewatering activities.



      12.   All waste including building materials and construction
debris shall be placed in the appropriate receptacles.



      13.   Onsite pollutants such as building materials, building
products, landscape materials, sanitary waste, fueling, and cleaning and
maintenance areas shall be appropriately managed to minimize and discharge.



      14.   Site development shall be in accordance with other
Village ordinances and State law, and it shall not decrease the normal
capacity of a flood plain by adding fill unless compensatory capacity is
provided elsewhere.



      15.   Erosion prevention measures in site development shall be
implemented in phases on a time schedule so as to more effectively control
potential conditions associated with the seasons (i.e., run off from the
melting of snow).



(Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



   C.   Soil Erosion Control Plan and Permit Requirements.



      1.   Plan Requirements.  A Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
Control Plan shall be submitted with the Final Engineering Plans to be
reviewed and approved by the Development Services Department.  For single
lots in established subdivisions a Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Plan shall be submitted for review and approval with the Building Permit Set
and approved by the Development Services Department.  The plan set shall
include all of the guidelines outlined in Section 6-411.B. that pertain to
the specific site conditions.



      2.   Letter of Credit Requirements.  When a Letter of Credit
is required for the development, the erosion control measures approved in the
Final Engineering plans shall be included in the Letter of Credit total. 
The amount of money earmarked for the erosion control measure will be held
until final stabilization of the project is complete or until an authorized
agent of the Development Services Department has approved a reduction or
release.



      3.   Permit Requirements.  Implementation of the approved
Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan is required prior to the issuance
of any Foundation Permits.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no
person shall commence or perform any grading, stripping, excavating, or
filling of land without having first installed the erosion and sedimentation
control measures outlined in the approved Final Engineering Plan set or
Building Permit set. 



      4.   Exceptions.  A soil erosion control plan and permit
shall not be required for any of the following:



         a.   Agricultural use of land, including farming, the
implementation of conservation measures included in a farm conservation plan
approved by  the Soil and Water Conservation District and community garden
plans.



         b.   Construction of conservation measures including,
but not limited to, sod waterways, terraces, grade stabilization structures,
berms and swales.



(Amd. Ord. 51672/20/17)



      5.   Application for Permit.  When development activity is
planned and there are no soil erosion control plans, application for a soil
erosion control plan permit shall be made by the owner of the property or his
authorized agent to the Development Services Department on a form furnished
for that purpose.  Each application shall include certification that any
land clearing, construction, or development involving the movement of earth
shall be in accordance with the plans approved upon issuance of the permit. 
Each application shall include a certification by an Illinois registered
professional engineer that the contour lines, current and proposed, and other
technical contents of the plans are valid.  When development is proposed as
a part of a building permit for a part of the site, the applications may be
combined, provided, that the information required under this Section is
submitted with the engineering drawings required for the building permit.



      Each application shall be accompanied by the following:



         a.   the name and address of the developer and owner;



         b.   The name, address and telephone number of any
design consulting firm or engineer;



         c.   Identification of person(s) or entity which will
have legal responsibility for maintenance or erosion control structures and
measures after development is completed;

boundary lines, utilities and buildings presently located on the site, drains
and roads on and within 1/2 mile of the site, intermittent and perennial
streams and water bodies downstream within 1/2 mile of the site, and a legend
and scale;



         e.   Proposed use of the site, including present
development and planned utilization; areas of excavation, grading, and
filling; proposed contours, finished grades, and street profiles; provisions
for storm drainage, including the control of accelerated runoff, with a
drainage area map and computations; existing trees and wooded areas; kinds
and locations of utilities; and areas and acreage proposed to be paved,
covered, sodded or seeded, vegetatively stabilized, or left undisturbed;



         f.   An erosion and sedimentation program showing or
describing all the erosion and sedimentation control measures necessary to
meet the objectives of this Section throughout all phases of construction and
necessary to meet the objectives at the completion of development of the
site.  The program may include erosion structures, temporary and permanent
vegetation and other conservation measures; and



         g.   The proposed phasing of development of the site,
including stripping and clearing, rough grading and construction, and final
grading and landscaping.  Phasing should identify the expected date on which
clearing will begin, the estimated duration of exposure of cleared areas, and
the sequence of clearing, installation of temporary sediment control
measures, installation of storm drainage, paving streets and parking areas,
and establishment of permanent vegetative cover.



      The Village Engineer may waive specific requirements for the
content of submission upon written finding that the information submitted is
sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and
principles of this Section and the standards contained in the Handbook
incorporated by Subsection (E)(1).



      6.   Time Schedules.  In the event a site developer is unable
to meet the phasing time schedules as contained in either the approved site
development plans or the site development permit, the site developer shall
submit, prior to missing the time schedule, an addendum to any plans or
permit application stating in the addendum that scheduling will not be met
and what, if any, additional measures will be taken.



(Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



   D.   Fees.  Fees for site development permits, when required by
this Section, shall be determined by the Village in accordance with Section
1-104 of these regulations.



   E.   Operation Standards and Requirements.



      1.   Handbook Adopted by Reference.  The procedures and
standards set out in the Illinois Urban Manual, as amended, and the Illinois
Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, as
amended, shall be applicable to all developments.  (Amd. Ord. 5312 
7/16/18)



      2.   Inspections.  Plans for grading work shall be maintained
at the site during grading.  In order to obtain the necessary grading
inspections, the permittee shall notify the Development Services Department
at least two (2) full working days before the following inspection is to be
made:  (Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



         a.   Rough Grading:  When all rough grading has been
completed; and



         b.   Final Inspection:  When all work, including
installation of all drainage and other structures and required planting, has
been completed.



      3.   Responsibility.  The permittee shall not be relieved of
responsibility for damage to persons or property otherwise imposed by law,
and the Village or its officers or agents shall not be made liable for such
damage, by (1) the issuance of a permit under this section, (2) compliance
with the provisions of that permit or with conditions attached to it by the
Village, (3) failure of Village officials to observe or recognize hazardous
or unsightly conditions, (4) failure of Village officials to recommend denial
of or to deny a permit, or (5) exemptions from the permit requirements of
this section.



      4.   Special Precautions.



         a.   If at any stage of the grading of any development
site the Village Engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the
site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to
imperil any property, public way,  watercourse or drainage structure, the
Village Engineer may require, as a condition of allowing the work to be done,
that such reasonable special precautions be taken as is considered advisable
to avoid the likelihood of such peril.  "Special precautions" may include,
but shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of
additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, cribbing, or
installa-tion of plant materials for erosion control.  Said special
precautions shall, as much as possible, reflect the standards contained in
the Handbook.



         b.   On large operations or where unusual site
conditions prevail, the Village Engineer or his designee may specify the
timing of grading or may require that the operations be conducted in specific
stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to
the advent of seasonal rains.  Said specifications or requirements shall, as
much as possible, reflect the standards contained in the Handbook.



      5.   Coordination with Local Stream and Water Body
Protection.  Except as allowed by the standards outlined in Section 6-412,
no grading or removal of top soil shall be allowed in the minimum setback
area defined on the Village's Natural Stream Channel and Water Body Map
(Exhibit 2).



      6.   Major Amendments of the Site Development or Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Plans.  Major amendments of the site development or
erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be submitted to the Development
Services Department and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the
same manner as the original plans.  Field modifications of a minor nature
may be authorized by the Development Services Department by written
authorization to the permittee.  (Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



   F.   Expiration of Permit.  Each permit shall expire and become
null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced
within six (6) months, or work is not completed by a date which shall be
specified in the permit; except that the Director of Development Services
may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the
specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written
application is made before the expiration date of the permit.  (Amd. Ord.
51672/20/17; Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



   G.   Effect on Other Permits.  The granting of a permit under the
provisions of this Section shall in no way affect the owner's responsibility
to obtain the approval required by any other statute, ordinance, or
regulation of any state agency or subdivision thereof, or to meet other
Village ordinances and regulations.



SECTION 6-412.   LOCAL STREAM AND WATERBODY PROTECTION.



   A.   Purpose.  The purpose of this Section is to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the present and future residents of the
Village and downstream drainage areas by providing for the protection,
preservation, proper maintenance, and use of public and private watercourses,
lakes and ponds.  It is specifically not the intent of this Section to
duplicate or in any way conflict with any regulations adopted by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers. 



   B.   Objectives.  This Section is specifically adopted to achieve
the following objectives:



      1.   to prevent flood damage by preserving storm and flood
water storage capacity;



      2.   to maintain the normal hydrologic balance of streams,
ponds, lakes, and groundwater by storing and filtering wet season runoff in
floodplains and wetlands and releasing it slowly to the stream to maintain
dry season stream flow;



      3.   to manage stormwater runoff and maintain natural runoff
conveyance systems, and minimize the need for storm sewer construction and
drainageway modification;



      4.   to improve water quality both by filtering and storing
sediments and attached pollutants, nutrients, and organic compounds before
they drain into streams, lakes or ponds and by maintaining the natural
pollutant assimilating capabilities of streams, lakes, ponds and floodplains;



      5.   to protect shorelines from soil erosion;



      6.   to protect fish spawning, breeding, nursery and feeding
grounds;



      7.   to protect wildlife habitat;



      8.   to preserve areas of special recreational, scenic, or
scientific interest, including natural areas and habitat of endangered
species;



      9.   to maintain and enhance the aesthetic qualities of
developing areas; and



      10.   to encourage the continued economic growth of the 
Village which depends in part, on an adequate quality of water, a pleasing
natural environment, and recreational opportunities in proximity to the
Village.



   C.   Boundary.  The procedures, standards and requirements
contained in this Section shall apply to all lots within water bodies and
streams, and to all lots identified wholly or in part on the stream and
waterbody map adopted by the Board of Trustees, as amended from time to time.



   D.   Development Activity in, and Minimum Setback from Streams,
Lakes and Ponds.



      1.   No development (except as provided in subsection 2) may
occur within the minimum setback area identified on the Village's Natural
Stream Channel and Water Body Map, as adopted by the Board of Trustees and as
amended from time to time, and in no case shall be less than fifty (50) feet
from a natural watercourse or waterbody, as measured from the top of bank of
the perennial stream, the centerline of an intermittent stream, or the
ordinary high water mark of a lake or pond, or twenty-five (25) feet for an
artificial detention/retention basin, as measured from the high water
level.  (Ord. 2746  6/5/95 & Ord. 307010/20/97; Amd. Ord. 5221 
9/18/17; Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



      2.   The following activities are permitted within the minimum
setback area only if, as a practical matter, they cannot be located outside
the setback area.  Such modification shall be approved only after
preparation of a report prepared by a qualified professional and approved by
the Director of Development Services.  The report shall note that the
modification will not adversely affect water quality; destroy, damage, or
disrupt a significant habitat area; adversely affect drainage and/or
stormwater retention capabilities; lead to unstable earth conditions; create
erosion hazards or be materially detrimental to any other property in the
area of the subject property or to the Village as a whole, including the loss
of open space or scenic vistas:  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



         a.   minor improvements, such as walkways, benches,
footbridges, observation decks and docks;



         b.   the maintenance, repair, replacement and
reconstruction of existing highways and bridges, electrical transmission and
telecommunication lines, poles, and towers; and



         c.   the establishment and development of public and
private parks and recreation areas, outdoor education areas, historic,
natural and scientific areas, game refuges, fish and wildlife habitat
improvement projects, game bird and animal farms, wildlife preserves and
public boat launching ramps.



      3.   Only limited filling and excavating necessary for the
development of public boat launching ramps, swimming beaches, or the
construction of park shelters or similar structures shall be permitted.  The
construction and maintenance of roads necessary for these permitted uses
shall be allowed only on a very limited basis and where no alternate location
outside of the setback area is available.



      4.   Land surface modification within the minimum setback
shall be permitted for the purpose of constructing stormwater drainage swales
between the developed area of a lot (including a storm-water detention
facility on the lot) and a stream, lake or pond.



      5.   An applicant for a special use permit must stabilize any
areas left exposed after land surface modification with vegetation normally
associated with the affected stream, lake or pond.  The planting of native
riparian vegetation is recommended as the preferred stabilization measure. 
Other techniques shall be used only when and where vegetation fails to
control erosion.  One alternative is rip-rap, using natural rock materials
where practicable, installed on eroding bank areas in a manner that provides
interstitial space for vegetative growth and habitat for macroinvertebrates
and other stream organisms. (Exhibit No. STS-13)  Lining of the stream
channel bottom shall not be permitted.



      6.   Access to property located near a stream, lake or pond or
related environmentally sensitive area, shall be minimized when such access
would adversely affect such area.



      7.   Silt or sediment basins shall not be installed within a
perennial stream channel or a waterbody.  However, such basins may be
installed within an intermittent stream channel.



   E   Local Stream and Waterbody Protection Plan.



      1.   A local stream and waterbody protection plan shall be
prepared for any proposed development within all or part of a stream or water
body corridor, as identified on the Village's Natural Stream Channel and
Water Body Map, and shall indicate:



         a.   dimension and area of parcel;



         b.   location of any existing and proposed structures;



         c.   location of existing or proposed on-site sewage
systems or private water supply systems;



         d.   location of any perennial stream and its banks, the
centerline of any intermittent stream, and any lake or pond as delineated by
its ordinary height water mark;



         e.   location of setback lines;



         f.   location of 100 year floodplain limits;



         g.   location of existing or future access roads;



         h.   specifications and dimensions of areas proposed for
wetland alterations;



         i.   an assessment of the potential impact of the
proposed development activity on the stream, lake or pond including, but not
limited to, loss of flood storage potential, loss of habitat, changes in
species diversity and quantity, impacts on water quality, increases in human
intrusion and impacts on associated streams, lakes or ponds or downstream
sensitive areas; and



         j.   such other information as reasonably requested by
the Director of Development Services.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      2.   The developer shall present evidence that demonstrates
that the proposed development shall not endanger health and safety, including
danger from gas, electricity, fuel, shortcircuiting, grounding, igniting or
electrocuting, and the obstruction or diversion of flood flow.  The
developer shall also show that the proposed development will not
substantially reduce natural floodwater storage capacity, destroy valuable
habitat for wildlife, adversely affect ground water resources, or increase
stormwater runoff velocity so that water levels on other land are
substantially raised or the danger from flooding increased.



   F.   Geologic and Soil Characteristics Report.   The site proposed
for development shall be investigated to determine the soil and geologic
characteristics.  A report, prepared by a registered professional engineer
experienced in the practice of geological and soils mechanics, shall be
submitted with each application for development within an environmentally
sensitive area.  This report shall include a description of soil type,
stability of surface and subsurface conditions.  Any area which the
investigation indicates to be subject to geologic or soil hazards shall not
be subjected to development unless the engineer can demonstrate conclusively
that these hazards to the area can be overcome.



   G.   Hydrologic Controls.  A hydrologic control plan that, in part,
describes the hydraulic characteristics of nearby watercourses, prepared by a
registered professional engineer experienced in civil engineering, shall be
submitted with each application for development. Unless otherwise provided in
this Section, the following restrictions, requirements and standards shall
apply to all development:



      1.   natural open channel drainageways shall be preserved; and



      2.   runoff from areas of concentrated impervious cover (e.g.,
roofs, driveways, streets, patios, etc.) shall be collected and transported
to a natural drainageway with sufficient capacity to accept the discharge
without undue erosion or detrimental impact.  Vegetated drainage swales are
preferred over conveyances constructed of concrete or other manufactured
materials.



   H.   Site Grading and Excavation.



      1.   A grading and excavation plan, prepared by a registered
professional engineer trained and experienced in civil engineering shall be
submitted with each application for development and shall include the
following unless a site development plan that includes grading and excavation
components has been or submitted in accordance with Section 5-106 of these
regulations:



         a.   property contours at one (1) foot intervals;



         b.   details of the existing terrain, trees and
woodlands, and drainage pattern;



         c.   dimensions, elevation and contours of grading,
excavation and fill;



         d.   a description of methods to be employed in
disposing of soil and other material that is removed from allowable grading
and excavation sites, including the location of the disposal site if on the
property;



         e.   a schedule showing when each stage of the project
will be completed, including the total area of soil surface to be disturbed
during each stage, and estimated starting and completion dates.  The
schedule shall be prepared so as to limit to the shortest possible period the
time soil is exposed and unprotected.  In no case shall the existing natural
vegetation be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to initiation of the improvements; and



         f.   a detailed description of the revegetation and
stabilization methods to be employed, to be prepared in conjunction with the
landscape plan provided in Subsection (I) (3), below.



      2.   Unless otherwise provided in this Section the following
restrictions, requirements and standards shall apply to all construction:



         a.   every effort shall be made to develop the site in
such a manner so as to minimize the alteration of the natural topography;



         b.   no grading, filling, cleaning, clearing, terracing
or excavation of any kind shall be initiated until final engineering plans
are approved and the application is approved by the Village Engineer; and



         c.   the depositing of any excavation, grading or
clearing material within a stream, lake or pond shall be prohibited.



      3.   In addition to locating all site improvements on the
subject property to minimize adverse impacts on the stream, lake or pond, the
applicant shall install a berm, curb, or other physical barrier during
construction, and following completion of the project, where necessary, to
prevent direct runoff and erosion from any modified land surface into the
stream, lake or pond.  All parking and vehicle circulation areas should be
located as far as possible from any stream, lake or pond.



      4.   The Village may limit construction activity in or near a
stream, lake or pond to specific months and to a maximum number of continuous
days or hours in order to minimize adverse impacts.  The Director of
Development Services may also require that equipment be operated from only
one side of a stream, lake, or pond in order to minimize bank disruption. 
Other construction techniques, conditions, and restrictions may be required
in order to minimize adverse impacts on streams, lakes or ponds and on any
related areas not subject to development.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   I.   Vegetation and Revegetation.



      1.   To minimize erosion, stabilize the streambank, protect
water quality, keep nutrients out of the water, maintain water temperature at
natural levels, preserve fish and wildlife habitat, screen man-made
structures, and preserve aesthetic values of the natural stream, lake or
pond, a natural vegetation strip shall be maintained along the edge of the
natural watercourse or waterbody.  Within required setbacks from a natural
watercourse or waterbody, a natural vegetation strip shall extend landward
twenty-five (25) feet, as measured from the top of bank of the perennial
stream, the centerline of an intermittent stream, the ordinary high water
mark of a lake or pond.  Refer to the Stormwater Management Area Landscape
in Section 6-305 for vegetation requirements adjacent to artificial
detention/retention basins.  (Amd. Ord. 5312  7/16/18)



      2.   Within the natural vegetation strip, trees and shrubs may
be selectively pruned or removed for harvest of merchantable timber, to
achieve a filtered view of the stream, lake or pond from the principal
structure and for reasonable private access to the stream, lake or pond. 
Said pruning and removal activities shall insure that a live root system
stays intact to provide for streambank stabilization and erosion control.



      3.   A landscape plan, prepared by a professional landscape
architect, shall be submitted with each application for development and shall
contain the following:



         a.   a plan describing the existing vegetal cover of the
property and showing those areas where the vegetation will be removed as part
of the proposed construction; and



         b.   a plan describing the proposed revegetation of
disturbed areas specifying the materials to be used.



      4.   The landscape plan will be evaluated according to:



         a.   the character and size of the proposed development
and potential for adverse impact on the stream, lake or pond;



         b.   the width of the stream;



         c.   the topography of the area;



         d.   the type and stability of the soils;



         e.   the type and density of the existing vegetation; and



         f.   the existence of diseased trees or trees in danger
of falling.



   J.   Watercourse Relocation and Minor Modifications.



      1.   Watercourse relocation or modification is generally not
permitted because these activities are not usually consistent with the
purposes of this Section.  Under unusual circumstances, relocation and minor
modification may be permitted as a special use where:



         a.   off-site hydrological conditions are causing
erosion, flooding and related problems; or



         b.   on-site soil and geological conditions are
resulting in unstable conditions that pose hazards to life, health, and
existing development; and



         c.   a mitigation plan is prepared and approved by the
Village Board of Trustees which results in a watercourse habitat equal to or
better than the original condition.



      2.   Channelization shall not be permitted, except for an area
within the right-of-way and within fifty (50) feet of the right-of-way of any
roadway that crosses a watercourse.



      3.   Modification of watercourses as a convenience for site
design purposes shall not be permitted. Stream modification, when permitted,
shall be subject to the following conditions and restrictions:



         a.   water quality, habitat, and storm water retention
must be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat
area may be destroyed;



         b.   the amount of flow and velocity of a stream shall
not be increased or decreased as the stream enters or leaves a subject
property unless this reflects an improvement over previous conditions in
terms of reduced flooding, reduced erosion, or enhanced low-flow conditions;
and



         c.   prior to diverting water into a new channel, a
qualified professional approved by the Village Engineer inspects the stream
modification and issues a written report to the Village Engineer that the
modified stream complies with the requirements of this Section.



      4.   Stream relocation shall be permitted in accordance with a
stream relocation plan which provides for:



         a.   the creation of a natural meander pattern, pools,
ripples, and substrate;



         b.   the formation of gentle side slopes (at least 3
feet horizontally for 1 foot vertically), including installation of erosion
control features;



         c.   the utilization of natural materials wherever
possible;



         d.   the planting of vegetation normally associated with
streams, including primarily native riparian vegetation;



         e.   the creation of spawning and nesting areas wherever
appropriate;



         f.   the re-establishment of the fish population
wherever appropriate;



         g.   the restoration of water flow characteristics
compatible with fish habitat areas, wherever appropriate;



         h.   the filling and revegetation of prior channel;



         i.   the proposed phasing plan specifying time of year
for all project phases; and



         j.   plans for sediment control.



      5.   Stream channel armoring in the form of bulkheads, rip-rap
or other materials or devices shall not be permitted except in accordance
with the following:



         a.   significant erosion cannot be prevented in any
other way and the use of vegetation will not sufficiently stabilize the
shoreline or bank;



         b.   the bulkhead, rip-rap or other device will minimize
the transmittal of wave energy or currents to other properties; and



         c.   the change in the horizontal or vertical
configuration of the land is kept to a minimum.



      6.   Culverts shall not be permitted in streams except in
accordance with following:



         a.   where a culvert is necessary for creating access to
a property (convenience in order to facilitate general site design is not to
be considered);



         b.   the culvert allows passage of fish inhabiting the
stream, and accommodates the 100 year storm, except where a restricting
culvert is desirable as part of an overall stream and flood management plan;
and



         c.   the culvert shall be maintained to be free of
debris and sediment to allow free passage of water and, if applicable, fish.



   K.   Ownership and Control.   The Village shall require an
applicant to submit a proposed plan of ownership and control of the local
stream and water body area.  The Board of Trustees shall approve the
proposed plan prior to the Board of Trustees' approval of the development,
provided that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed ownership and
control will adequately protect the local stream and water body area in
accordance with the standards of these regulations.  Methods of ownership
and control may include, but are not limited to, homeowner association
covenants, Village management plans or private protection plans.



   L.   Stream Channel and Waterbody Development Permit.



      1.   Except as otherwise provided in this Section, to ensure
that proposed development can be carried out which is compatible and
harmonious with the natural amenities of the stream channel area and with
surrounding land uses, no person shall commence development within the
minimum setback area without first having obtained a Stream Channel and
Waterbody Development Permit.  A request for a permit shall be submitted to
and approved by the Village Engineer.



      2.   No permit shall be issued unless the applicant submits
engineering data, surveys, site plans and other information as the Village
may reasonably require in order to determine the effects of such development
on the affected land and water areas.  The permit shall not be approved by
the Village Engineer unless:



         a.   the development will not detrimentally affect or
destroy natural features such as streams, lakes, ponds, and forested areas,
but will preserve and incorporate such features into the development's site
design;



         b.   the location of natural features and the site's
topography have been considered in the designing and citing of all physical
improvements;



         c.   adequate assurances have been received so that the
clearing of the site of top soil, trees, and other natural features before
the commencement of building operations will occur.  Only those areas
approved for the placement of physical improvements may be cleared;



         d.   the development will not substantially reduce the
natural retention storage capacity of any stream, lake or pond, thereby
increasing the magnitude and volume of flood at other locations;



         e.   the soil and subsoil conditions are suitable for
excavation and site preparation and the drainage is designed to prevent
erosion and environmentally deleterious surface runoff; and



         f.   the development will be free from offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter, odorous matter, fumes,
water pollution, and other objectionable influences.



      3.   No structure shall be constructed, altered, enlarged or
otherwise created or moved, nor shall there be any clearing or removal of
natural ground cover and/or trees in connection with site preparation for
construction, immediate or future, within the sensitive area for any purpose
unless a permit is granted subject to the provisions of this Section.



      4.   Dumping, filling, mining, excavating, dredging, or
transferring of any earth material within the area is prohibited unless a
special use permit is granted.  However, normal gardening, farming and
housekeeping activities shall not be affected.



      5.   No ponds or pools shall be created and no other
alterations or improvements shall be allowed in the sensitive area for
recreational uses, storm water management, agricultural uses, or as scenic
features, unless a special use permit is granted.



   M.   Permit Exceptions.  The permit provisions of this Section
shall not apply to:



      1.   emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. 
When emergency work is performed under this Section, the person performing it
shall report the pertinent facts relating to the work to the Village within
ten (10) days after commencement of the work and shall thereafter obtain a
special use permit and shall perform such work as may be determined by the
Village Engineer to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such
emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity of the
watercourse; and



      2.   work consisting of the operation, repair, or maintenance
of any lawful use of land existing on the date of adoption of these
regulations.



   N.   Effect on Other Permits. The granting of a permit under the
provisions of this Section shall in no way affect the owner's responsibility
to obtain the approval required by any other statute, ordinance, or
regulation of any state agency or subdivision thereof, or to meet other
Village ordinances and regulations.



   O.   Expiration of Permit.  Each permit shall expire and become
null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced
within six (6) months, or work is not completed by a date which shall be
specified in the permit; except that the Director of Development Services
may, if the permittee presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented work being commenced or completed within the
specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written
application is made before the expiration date of the permit.  (Amd. Ord.
5167  2/20/17)



SECTION 6-413. WETLANDS PROTECTION.



   A.   General.  The nontidal wetlands of the Village of Orland Park
are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development
constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations.  In their
natural state, nontidal wetlands serve man and nature.  They provide habitat
areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation, water-quality maintenance and
pollution control, flood control, shoreline erosion control, natural resource
education, scientific study, open space, and recreation opportunities.



   A considerable number of these important natural resources have been
lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavation, building,
pollution, and other acts.  Piecemeal or cumulative losses may, over time,
destroy remaining wetlands.  Damaging or destroying nontidal wetlands
threatens public safety and the general welfare.



   It is therefore necessary for the Village to ensure maximum protection
for nontidal wetlands by discouraging development activities in nontidal
wetlands and those activities at adjacent upland sites that may adversely
affect nontidal wetlands and to encourage restoration of already degraded or
destroyed systems.  (Ord.2746 - 6/5/95)



   B.   Purpose.  It is the policy of the Village of Orland Park to
encourage or require planning to avoid or minimize damage to nontidal
wetlands wherever prudent or feasible; to require that activities not
dependent upon a nontidal wetland location be located at upland sites; to
allow nontidal wetland losses only when such losses are in the public
interest and after all practicable measures have been applied to reduce those
losses to the unavoidable minimum; to provide for compensation in the form of
nontidal wetland restoration or creation to offset further losses.



   Furthermore, any activities in a wetland must not threaten public
safety or cause nuisances by:



      1.   Blocking flood flows, destroying flood storage areas, or
destroying storm barriers, thereby raising flood heights or velocities on
other land and increasing flood damages;



      2.   Causing water pollution through any means, including
location of wastewater disposal systems in wet soils;  unauthorized
application of pesticides, herbicides, and  algacides; disposal of solid
wastes or stormwater runoff directly into a wetland site; or creation of
unstabilized fills;



      3.   Increasing erosion; or



      4.   Increasing runoff of sediment and stormwater.



   In addition, it is the policy of the Village not to permit activities
in or affecting nontidal wetlands that could destroy natural wetland
functions important to the general welfare by:



      1.   Decreasing breeding, spawning, nesting, wintering,
feeding, or other critical habitat for fish and wildlife, including rare,
threatened, and endangered plant and animal species and commercially and
recreationally important wildlife;



      2.   Interfering with the exchange of nutrients needed by fish
and other forms of wildlife;



      3.   Decreasing groundwater recharge capability;



      4.   Destroying sites needed for education and scientific
research as outdoor biophysical laboratories, living classrooms, and training
areas;



      5.   Interfering with public rights in waters and recreation
opportunities for fishing, boating, hiking, birdwatching, photography,
camping, and other similar activities in nontidal wetlands; or



      6.   Destroying aesthetic and property values.



   C.   Applicability.



      1.   This section shall apply to all lands in or within 50
feet of a nontidal wetland located within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Orland Park.  Areas shown on the Village of Orland Parks Comprehensive
Plans? Environmental Areas Mapping Wetlands Map as wetlands are presumed to
be nontidal wetlands consistent with the definition thereof. This official
Wetlands Map shows the general location of nontidal wetlands and should be
consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near nontidal wetlands
before engaging in regulated activity.



      2.   The actual boundaries of non-tidal wetlands shall
ordinarily be determined by the applicant through the performance of a field
survey applying the nontidal wetland definition.  The Wetlands Map is to be
used as a guide to the general location of nontidal wetlands.  The applicant
is required under Section 6-413-D.1 of this ordinance to show a Wetland
District boundary on a scaled drawing submitted as part of the permit
application.  Evidence documenting the results of the boundary survey may be
required by the Village Engineer.



   D.   Permit Requirements.



      1.   No regulated activity in or within 50 feet of a nontidal
wetland may be conducted without a permit from the Village Engineer and full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations.  All activities that are not permitted as of right or as
special permit uses shall be prohibited.



      2.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this ordinance or any
other law to the contrary, the Village Engineer may issue a temporary
nontidal wetlands permit through oral or written authorization, provided a
written permit application is received within five days, if he or she deems
that an unacceptable threat to life or severe loss of property will occur if
an emergency permit is not granted.  The emergency permit may be terminated
at any time with out process upon a determination by the Village Engineer
that the action was not or is no longer necessary to protect human health or
the environment. 



      3.   To guide restoration and creation actions should a
violation occur, the Village Engineer shall have the power to order the
violator to develop a plan as described in Section 6-413 G.2. of this
ordinance for the approval of the Village Engineer.  Field verification of
absence or existence of wetland areas, in the form of a wetland report
checklist, shall be provided for approval of the Village Engineer.  (Ord.
3837 - 12/1/03)



   E.   Uses by Right in a Nontidal Wetland.



      1.   The following uses shall be allowed as a right within a
nontidal wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance or federal, state or local law and provided they do not require
structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein or
authorized by special permit:



         a.   Conservation or preservation of soil, water,
vegetation, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife;



         b.   Outdoor recreational activities, including fishing,
birdwatching, hiking, biking, boating, horseback riding, swimming, and
canoeing;



         c.   The harvesting of wild crops, such as marsh hay,
ferns, moss, wild rice, berries, tree fruits, and seeds in a manner that is
not injurious to natural reproduction of such crops and provided the
harvesting does not require alteration of nontidal wetland by changing
existing nontidal wetland water conditions or sources, tilling of soil, or
planting of crops;



         d.   Forestry practices limited to the thinning and
harvesting of native timber in accordance with a forest management plan that
incorporates best management practices approved by the Cook County Forest
Preserve District pursuant to its current regulations.



         e.   The continued cultivation of agricultural crops,
provided no nontidal wetlands are subject to cultivation where no such use
existed five years prior to the effective date of application.



         f.   Education, scientific research, and nature trails;



      2.   Special Permit Uses in a nontidal Wetland.



         Regulated activities other than those specified in Section
6-413 E.1 may not be conducted except upon application to the Development
Services department and issuance of a special use permit.  (Amd. Ord. 5167
 2/20/17)



   F.   Standards and Procedures for Special Use Permits.



      1.   Procedures.  Application for a special use permit to
conduct a regulated activity shall be made to the Development Services
Department on forms furnished by that office.  All special uses must be
established in nontidal wetlands as special uses in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in Section 5-105 (I) of this Code. 
Permits shall ordinarily be valid for a period of one year from the date of
issue and shall expire at the end of that time unless a longer period is
specified by the Director of Development Services upon issuance of the
permit.  The request for renewal of a permit shall follow the same form and
procedure as the original application except that the Director of Development
Services shall have the option of not holding a hearing if the original
intent of the permit is not altered or extended in any significant way. 
(Am. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      2.   Standards.  The Village Board, after according
consideration to the comments of the general public, other affected
municipalities and other counties, and federal and state agencies with
jurisdiction over the area in question, shall issue a nontidal wetland permit
only if it finds that  the regulated activity is in the public interest and
that the applicant has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that
the regulated activity:



         a.   Is water-dependent or requires access to the
nontidal wetland as a central element of its basic function, or is not
water-dependent but has no practicable alternative;



         b.   Will result in minimum feasible alteration or
impairment to the nontidal wetland?s functional characteristics and its
existing contour, vegetation, fish and wildlife resources, and hydrological
conditions;



         c.   Will not jeopardize the continued existence of
species that appear on federalor state endangered species lists;



         d.   Will not cause significant degradation of
groundwater or surface-water quality;



         e.   Complies with all applicable state, local, and
federal laws, including those related to sediment control, pollution control,
floodplain zoning, and on-site  wastewater disposal;



         f.   Will provide a nontidal wetland buffer area of not
less than 50 feet between the nontidal wetland and upland activities for
those portions of a regulated activity that need not be conducted in the
wetland; and



         g.   Complies with other standards contained in this
ordinance, including those pertaining to nontidal wetland creation and
restoration as required.



      3.   Practicable Alternative.



   For all permit applications, an alternative site for the proposed
activity shall be considered practicable if it is available and the proposed
activity can be carried out on that site after taking into consideration
costs, existing technology, infrastructure, and logistics, in light of
overall project purposes.



   G.   Nontidal Wetland Restoration and Creation.



      1.   Standards.  As a condition of a permit issued or as an
enforcement action under this ordinance, the Director of Development Services
may require that the applicant engage in the restoration or creation of other
nontidal wetlands in order to offset, in whole or in part, the losses
resulting from the action of an applicant or violator under these
regulations.  In making a determination of whether such a requirement will
be imposed, and, if so, the degree to which it would be required, the
Director of Development Services will consider the following:  (Amd. Ord.
5167  2/20/17)



         a.   Recommendations by the Army Corp of Engineers.



         b.   The long and short term effects of the action upon
the nontidal wetland and associated aquatic ecosystem, and the reversible or
irreversible nature of the impairment or loss;



         c.   The type and benefit of the wetland functions and
associated resources lost;



         d.   The type, size, and location of the wetland
altered, and the effect it may have upon the remaining system or watershed of
which the wetland is a part;



         e.   Observed or predicted trends with regard to the
gains or losses of this type of wetland in the watershed of which the wetland
is a part;



         f.   The cost and likely success of the possible
compensation measures in relation to the magnitude of the proposed project or
violation; and



         g.   The degree to which an applicant has demonstrated a
good-faith effort to incorporate measures to minimize and avoid wetland
impacts within the proposed project.



      An applicant or violator may prepare or be required by the
Director of Development Services to develop a nontidal wetlands restoration
or creation plan of review and approval of the Director of Development
Services.  The approval shall be based on the recommendation of a qualified
consultant which shall be at the cost of the applicant.  The creation or
restoration of wetlands shall not be an alternative to the standards set
forth in Section 6-413.G.1. but shall be used only to compensate for
unavoidable losses.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



      2.   Restoration and Creation Plan Requirements.



   The plan should state the location, by metes and bounds description, of
the site proposed for restoration or creation; ownership; size; type; and
complete ecological assessment (flora, fauna, hydrology, wetland functions,
etc.) of the wetland being restored or the area where a new wetland will be
created; and the natural suitability of the proposed site for establishing
the replacement wetland (i.e., water source and drainage patterns,
topographic position, wildlife habitat opportunities, value of the existing
area to be converted, etc.)  In addition, plane view and cross-sectional,
scaled drawings; topographic survey data, including slope percentage and
final grade elevations; and other technical information are required in
sufficient detail to explain, illustrate, and provide for:



         a.   Soil and substrate conditions; topographic
elevations; grading and excavation; erosion and sediment control needed for
wetland construction and long-term survival;



         b.   Planting plans specifying plant species types,
quantities, locations, size spacing, or density; source of plant materials,
propagules, or seeds; timing, season, water, and nutrient requirements for
planting; and, where appropriate, measures to protect plants from predation;



         c.   Water-quality parameters, water source, water
depths, water-control structures, and water-level maintenance practices
needed to achieve the necessary ambient water conditions and
hydrocycle/hydroperiod characteristics;



         d.   Mid-course corrections and a three-year monitoring
and replacement plan establishing responsibility for removal of exotic and
nuisance vegetation and permanent establishment of the wetland system and all
its component parts; and



         e.   A demonstration of fiscal, administrative, and
technical competence of sufficient standing to successfully execute the
overall project.



   H.   Suspension, Revocation.



      The Director of Development Services may suspend or revoke a
permit if he or she finds that the applicant has not complied with the
conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope
of the work set forth in the permit.  The Director of Development Services
shall cause notice of his or her denial, issuance, conditional issuance,
revocation, or suspension of a permit by written notice to the petitioner. 
(Ord. 2746  6/5/95; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



SECTION 6-414. CONSERVATION AREAS.



   A.   Intent.  It is the intent of the Village to promote open space
in order to preserve natural features and the Village's natural heritage, as
well as to provide for flood control, to provide residents with views of
natural areas, to provide residents the opportunity to interact with nature
in their own neighborhoods, to increase property values, to provide wildlife
habitat corridors, and to generally improve the quality of life.  The Board
of Trustees shall consider the use of conservation easements as an
alternative way of preserving open space in developments.



   B.   Requirements.



      1.   Conservation easements shall be required when critical
and sensitive environmental areas, as identified in the Comprehensive Plan,
are located in a proposed development and are not protected through public
land acquisition.



      2.   Developers shall be required to provide legal
descriptions of the conservation easement, to enter into a grant of
conservation easement, and to record the easement on a Plat of Subdivision
with the County.



      3.   Developers shall transfer the conservation easement only
to an agency of the State of Illinois, to a unit of local government or to a
not-for-profit corporation or trust whose primary purposes include the
conservation of land, natural areas, open space or water areas, or the
preservation of native plants or animals, or biotic communities.



      4.   The conservation easement grantee shall preserve and
maintain said property in its natural state and maintain all trails and
nature signs located within said property.



      5.   The grantee shall have the right to view the easement in
its scenic condition at ground level from adjacent roadways and property. 
  (Ord.2746 - 6/5/95)



SECTION 6-415. BIKEWAYS AND BIKEPATHS.



   A.   Intent.  It is the intent of the Village to provide bikeways,
bikepaths and other bicycle facilities in order to promote bicycling as a
means of both recreation and transportation.  The Board of Trustees shall
consider bicycle traffic when it approves all future improvements to the
existing street system, as well as the cost and desirability of building
facilities such as bicycle lanes, bicycle routes, shoulder improvements and
wide curb lanes.



   B.   Requirements.



      1.   Bikeways shall be required on one side of all arterial
and collector streets or at other alternate locations including reasonable
off-site connections that provide contiguity to the overall system.  The use
of additional pedestrian ways or bikepaths in any instance to provide safe
and convenient access to schools, parks or other similar destinations may be
recommended by the Plan Commission and required by the Board of Trustees.



      2.   Developers shall be required to install bicycle parking
and racks sufficient to serve all new commercial and industrial
developments.  Developers of other uses may be required to install bicycle
parking and racks, provided that the uses generate such need, and subject to
the approval of the Director of Development Services.  (Amd. Ord. 5167 
2/20/17)



      3.   Although bike paths are generally not required in the
rural/suburban area (Exhibit 2), there may be circumstances in which
continuity for larger networks of bicycle paths, or nearby sidewalk or bike
path access to schools, parks, neighborhood commercial, or similar features
may necessitate installation of such facilities in certain areas. 
Sidewalks, bikepaths or streetlights on perimeter roads may be required if
health, safety and welfare reasons warrant such installation.



   C.   Construction Requirements.  The construction requirements and
other standards set out in the Guide For Development of New Bicycle
Facilities, 1981, or as hereinafter updated, published by the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), 444 North
Capital Street, N.W., Suite 225, Washington, D.C. 20001, that pertain to the
planning, operation and maintenance of roadways, bikeways and bikepaths shall
be applicable to all development located within the Village.  Copies of this
Guide shall be kept on file at the Department of Development Services and the
Building Department.  (Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)

ARTICLE 7:
MICELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



SECTION 7-101. CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES



   A.   Time of Construction of Improvements.   All public and private
improvements required by these regulations shall be installed after approval
of a subdivision plat, a final resubdivision plan, or a final development
plan.  No construction shall commence prior to said approval.



   B.   Time of Construction of Buildings. No building permits shall be
issued for the construction of any building or structure unless a final plan
of a subdivision, final plan of resubdivision, or final development plan has
been approved and recorded and unless all public improvements are provided to
serve the subdivision in the manner and in accordance with the approved and
recorded plat; provided, however, that building permits may be issued if all
grading operations and drainage improvements are completed and the first
layer of bituminous concrete wearing course has been placed on the road or
roads to be improved, and provided that a road with the first layer of
bituminous concrete wearing course has been placed on a road leading to any
model or trailer or that other access to such model or trailer is provided by
an improved road.



   C.   Use of Existing Streets.   Only those streets designated by
the Plan Commission during the approval of the final plan or final
development plan may be used for access to the subdivision by all equipment
and trucks engaged in the construction of all improvements, utility services
and buildings.



   D.   Sequence of Construction.   All underground utilities, water
mains, sanitary sewers or storm sewers installed in streets, alleys, service
roads or highways shall be installed prior to the surfacing of such
streets.  Service connections to such underground utilities and sewers shall
be extended to the property line of each lot so as to prevent disturbing the
surface improvements in such public ways when service connections are later
made.  Where underground utilities are located in the parkway adjacent to
the paved roadway, service connections to properties across such roads shall
only be made by drilling under the pavement in such a way that the surfacing
is not disturbed or weakened.  All access streets shall be constructed
before building construction may begin.



   E.   Maintenance During Construction.  The subdivider shall clean
and maintain all public ways, sewers, ponds and drains free from snow, mud,
debris, trash or other extraneous material prior to acceptance of the street
by the Village  at all times during construction and as the Village Engineer
may otherwise deem necessary.  The Police Department shall have the
authority to issue tickets to the developer or his or her agents in the event
of any such violation.  The Village shall withhold any subsequent
development approvals for the development until the tickets have been paid
and the violation corrected.



   F.   Construction Noise.  The subdivider shall take every
precaution to assure that undue noise from construction operations is kept at
a minimum.  To assure that contractors are aware of this requirement, the
following construction noise standard shall be made a part of all contracts
entered into for construction of proposed improvements:



      1.   Any engine or engine-driven equipment used for hauling or
construction activities shall be equipped with an adequate muffler in
constant operation. The exhaust system shall not have a cutout, bypass or

the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the
Village rights-of-way and the Village as a whole.



      2.   Intent.  In enacting this Section, the Village intends
to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the Village and, in
particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by
establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility
facilities, including without limitation:



         a)   prevent interference with the use of streets,
sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places;



         b)   prevent the creation of visual and physical
obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and
pedestrian traffic;



         c)   prevent interference with the facilities and
operations of the Village's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located
in rights-of-way or public property;



         d)   protect against environmental damage, including but
not limited to damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities;



         e)   protect against increased stormwater run-off due to
structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces;



         f)   preserve the character of the neighborhoods in
which facilities are installed;



         g)   preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined
parkways that characterize the Village's residential neighborhoods;

facilities in the rights-of-way; and



         i)   assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of
private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations.



      3.   Facilities Subject to This Section.  This Section
applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the Village. A facility
lawfully established prior to the effective date of this Section may continue
to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently
constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any
applicable franchise, license or similar agreement.



      4.   Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.  The
Village, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to
enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of
locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or
within the Village rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to
enter into such an agreement may request that the Village enter into such an
agreement. In such an agreement, the Village may provide for terms and
conditions inconsistent with this Section.



      5.   Effect of Franchises, Licenses, or Similar Agreements.

license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such
agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof, provided however that
the Village may impose on such provider such competitively neutral and
nondiscriminatory requirements, terms and conditions set forth in this
Section as are (a) necessary to preserve, protect or to advance the public
safety and welfare or to manage rights-of-way, and (b) do not conflict with
the requirements, terms and conditions, set forth in such franchise, license

to be paid by any electricity utility that is paying the municipal
electricity infrastructure maintenance fee pursuant to the Electricity
Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.



   E.   Action on Permit Applications.



      1.   Village Review of Permit Applications. Completed permit
applications, containing all required documentation, shall be examined by the
Village Department of Public Works within a reasonable time after filing. 
If the application does not conform to the requirements of applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Department of
Public Works shall reject such application in writing, stating the reasons
therefor.  If the Village Department of Public Works is satisfied that the
proposed work conforms to the requirements of this Section and applicable
ordinances, codes, laws, rules, and regulations, the Village Department of
Public Works shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.  In all
instances, it shall be the duty of the applicant to demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Village Department of Public Works, that the construction
proposed under the application shall be in full compliance with the
requirements of this Section.



      2.   Additional Village Review of Applications of
Telecommunications Retailers.



         a)   Pursuant to Section 4 of the Telephone Company Act,
220 ILCS 65/4, a telecommunications retailer shall notify the Village that it
intends to commence work governed by this Section for facilities for the
provision of telecommunications services.  Such notice shall consist of
plans, specifications, and other documentation sufficient to demonstrate the
purpose and intent of the facilities, and shall be provided by the
telecommunications retailer to the Village not less than ten (10) days prior
to the commencement of work requiring no excavation and not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the commencement of work requiring excavation.  The
Village Department of Public Works shall specify the portion of the
right-of-way upon which the facility may be placed, used and constructed.



         b)   In the event that the Village Department of Public
Works fails to provide such specification of location to the
telecommunications retailer within either (i) ten (10) days after service of
notice to the Village by the telecommunications retailer in the case of work
not involving excavation for new construction or (ii) twenty-five (25) days
after service of notice by the telecommunications retailer in the case of
work involving excavation for new construction, the telecommunications
retailer may commence work without obtaining a permit under this Section.



         c)   Upon the provision of such specification by the
Village, where a permit is required for work pursuant to Sub-Section D. of
this Section, the telecommunications retailer shall submit to the Village an
application for a permit and any and all plans, specifications and
documentation available regarding the facility to be constructed.  Such
application shall be subject to the requirements of Sub-Sections D. 3 and D.
4 of this Section.



      3.   Additional Village Review of Applications of Holders of
State Authorization Under  the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007.
Applications by a utility that is a holder of a State-issued authorization
under the Cable and Video Competition Law of 2007 shall be deemed granted
forty-five (45) days after submission to the Village, unless otherwise acted
upon by the Village, provided the holder has complied with applicable Village
codes, ordinances, and regulations.



   F.   Effect of Permit.



      1.   Authority Granted; No Property Right or Other Interest
Created. A permit from the Village authorizes a permittee to undertake only
certain activities in accordance with this Section on Village rights-of-way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to
impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in or adjacent the
rights-of-way.



      2.   Duration.  No permit issued under this Section shall be
valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless construction is actually
begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.



      3.   Pre-construction meeting required.  No construction
shall begin pursuant to a permit issued under this Section prior to
attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who
will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting.  The
pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated
by the Village with such Village representatives in attendance as the Village
deems necessary.  The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the work
under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas
where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence of
other utility facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid
disruption of other utilities, use of rights-of-way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.



      4.   Compliance with All Laws Required.  The issuance of a
permit by the Village does not excuse the permittee from complying with other
requirements of the Village and applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules,
and regulations.



      5.   Business License Required.  All contractors and
subcontractors performing construction activities authorized under a permit
issued by the Village shall be properly licensed and bonded in accordance
with the requirements of the Village. Issuance of a permit by the Village
does not excuse contractors or subcontractors of the applicant from obtaining
the proper license to do business in the Village.



   G.   Revised Permit Drawings. 



   In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any
material respect from the locations identified in the plans, drawings and
specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee shall
submit a revised set of as-built drawings or plans to the Village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work.  The revised
drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit.  If any
deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of this
Section, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with
Sub-Section U. of this Section.  If the Village denies the request for a
variance, then the permittee shall either remove the facility from the
right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit and
submit revised drawings or plans therefor.



   H.   Insurance.



      1.   Required Coverages and Limits.  Unless otherwise
provided by franchise, license, or similar agreement, each utility occupying
right-of-way or constructing any facility in the right-of-way shall secure
and maintain the following liability insurance policies insuring the utility
as named insured and naming the Village, and its elected and appointed
officers, officials, consultants, agents, and employees as additional insured
on the policies listed in paragraphs a. and b. below:



         a.   Commercial general liability insurance, including
premises-operations, explosion, collapse, and underground hazard (commonly
referred to as X, C, and U coverages) and products-completed operations
coverage with limits not less than:



            1.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for bodily
injury or death to each person;



            2.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for
property damage resulting from any one accident; and



            3.   Five million dollars ($5,000,000) for all
other types of liability;



         b.   Automobile liability for owned, non-owned and hired
vehicles with a combined single limit of one million dollars ($1,000,000) for
personal injury and property damage for each accident;



         c.   Worker's compensation with statutory limits; and



         d.   Employer's liability insurance with limits of not
less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per employee and per accident.



   If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the
contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and
subcontractors shall comply with this Sub-Section.



      2.   Excess or Umbrella Policies.  The coverages required by
this Sub-Section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella
policies.  Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over
underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss
covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy,
the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss.



      3.   Copies Required.  The utility shall provide copies of
any of the policies required by this Sub-Section to the Village within ten
(10) days following receipt of a written request therefor from the Village.



      4.   Maintenance and Renewal of Required Coverages.  The
insurance policies required by this Sub-Section shall contain the following
endorsement:



      It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy may not be
canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Village, by registered mail or certified mail, return
receipt requested, of a written notice addressed to the Village President of
such intent to cancel or not to renew.



      Within ten (10) days after receipt by the Village of said notice,
and in no event later than ten (10) days prior to said cancellation, the
utility shall obtain and furnish to the Village evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this Section.



      5.   Self-Insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a
portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by
Sub-Section H. 1 of this Section.  A utility that self-insures is not
required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the
requirement for the naming of additional insureds under Sub-Section H. 1, or
the requirements of Sub-Sections H. 2, H. 3 and H. 4 of this Section.  A
utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the Village evidence
sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance
coverage and limit requirements required under Sub-Section H. 1 of this
Section, such as evidence that the utility is a private self insurer under
the Workers Compensation Act.



      6.   Effect of Insurance and Self-Insurance on Utility's
Liability.  The legal liability of the utility to the Village and any person
for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or
self-insurance required by this Sub-Section shall not be limited by such
insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts
thereunder.



      7.   Insurance Companies.  All insurance provided pursuant to
this Section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued
by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the State
of Illinois.  [All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be
rated A- or better and of a class size X or higher by A.M. Best Company.]



   I.   Indemnification. 



   By occupying or constructing facilities in the right-of-way, a utility
shall be deemed to agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Village and its
elected and appointed officials and officers, employees, consultants, agents
and representatives harmless from and against any and all injuries, claims,
demands, judgments, damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney's fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from
or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its
affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights-of-way, and in
providing or offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or
omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this  Section or by a
franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the
utility's indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries,
claims, demands, judgments, damages, losses or expenses arising out of or
resulting from the negligence, misconduct or breach of this Section by the
Village, its officials, officers, employees, consultants, agents or
representatives.



   J.   Security.



      1.   Purpose.  The permittee shall establish a Security Fund
in a form and in an amount as set forth in this Sub-Section. The Security
Fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this Sub-Section at
the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work
authorized under the permit.  The Security Fund shall serve as security for:



         a)   The faithful performance by the permittee of all
the requirements of this Section;



         b)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the
Village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes,
rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the Village
issued pursuant to this Section; and



         c)   The payment by permittee of all liens and all
damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the Village may pay or incur by
reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this
Section including, without limitation, any damage to public property or
restoration work the permittee is required by this Section to perform that
the Village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of
the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due
the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Section or any other
applicable law.



      2.   Form.  The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to
the Village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond
in a form acceptable to the Village, or an unconditional letter of credit in
a form acceptable to the Village.  Any surety bond or letter of credit
provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:



         a)   Provide that it will not be canceled without prior
notice to the Village and the permittee;



         b)   Not require the consent of the permittee prior to
the collection by the Village of any amounts covered by it; and



         c)   Shall provide a location convenient to the Village
and within the State of Illinois at which it can be drawn.



      3.   Amount.  The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be
sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the
right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Department of
Public Works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, that the Village estimates are likely
to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration.  The
dollar amount so determined by the Village shall be multiplied by 125% to
establish the Security Fund amount. Where the construction of facilities
proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations
in the Village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in
one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in
another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of
restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Department of Public
Works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a
single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the
construction under the permit.  The amount of the Security Fund for phased
construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been
required under the provisions of this Sub-Section 3. for any single phase.



      4.   Withdrawals.  The Village, upon fourteen (14) calendar
days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its
intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw
an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not
reimbursed the Village for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice
period.  Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:



         a)   Fails to make any payment required to be made by
the permittee hereunder;



         b)   Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities
that are due and unpaid;



         c)   Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages,
claims, costs or expenses which the Village has been compelled to pay or
incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or



         d)   Fails to comply with any provision of this Section
that the Village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in
the Security Fund.



      5.   Replenishment.  Within fourteen (14) calendar days after
receipt of written notice from the Village that any amount has been withdrawn
from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security Fund to the
amount specified in Sub-Section 3. of this Section J.



      6.   Interest.  The permittee may request that any and all
interest accrued on the amount in the Security Fund be returned to the
permittee by the Village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the
Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund
below the minimum balance required in Sub-Section 3. of this Section J.



      7.   Closing and Return of Security Fund.  Upon completion of
the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the
return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit,
within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any
provisions of this Section or other applicable law.  In the event of any
revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary to
cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a
result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs,
loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.



      8.   Rights Not Limited.  The rights reserved to the Village
with respect to the Security Fund are in addition to all other rights of the
Village, whether reserved by this Section or otherwise authorized by law, and
no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said Security Fund
shall affect any other right the Village may have.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery
with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise
violated.



   K.   Permit Suspension and Revocation.



      1.   Village Right to Revoke Permit.  The Village may revoke
or suspend a permit issued pursuant to this Section for one or more of the
following reasons:



         a)   Fraudulent, false, misrepresenting, or materially
incomplete statements in the permit application;



         b)   Non-compliance with this Section;



         c)   Permittee's physical presence or presence of
permittee's facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within
the rights-of-way presents a direct or imminent threat to the public health,
safety, or welfare; or



         d)   Permittee's failure to construct the facilities
substantially in accordance with the permit and approved plans.



      2.   Notice of Revocation or Suspension.  The Village shall
send written notice of its intent to revoke or suspend a permit issued
pursuant to this Section stating the reason or reasons for the revocation or
suspension and the alternatives available to permittee under this Section K.



      3.   Permittee Alternatives Upon Receipt of Notice of
Revocation or Suspension.  Upon receipt of a written notice of revocation or
suspension from the Village, the permittee shall have the following options:



         a)   Immediately provide the Village with evidence that
no cause exists for the revocation or suspension;



         b)   Immediately correct, to the satisfaction of the
Village, the deficiencies stated in the written notice, providing written
proof of such correction to the Village within five (5) working days after
receipt of the written notice of revocation; or



         c)   Immediately remove the facilities located on, over,
above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way and restore
the rights-of-way to the satisfaction of the Village providing written proof
of such removal to the Village within ten (10) working days after receipt of
the written notice of revocation. 



   The Village may, in its discretion, for good cause shown, extend the
time periods provided in this Sub-Section.



      4.   Stop Work Order.  In addition to the issuance of a
notice of revocation or suspension, the Village may issue a stop work order
immediately upon discovery of any of the reasons for revocation set forth
within Sub-Section 1. of this Section K.



      5.   Failure or Refusal of the Permittee to Comply.  If the
permittee fails to comply with the provisions of Sub-Section 3. of this
Section K., the Village or its designee may, at the option of the Village:
(1) correct the deficiencies;  (2) upon not less than twenty (20) days
notice to the permittee, remove the subject facilities or equipment; or (3)
after not less than thirty (30) days notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the non-compliance, deem them abandoned and property of the Village. 
The permittee shall be liable in all events to the Village for all costs of
removal.



   L.   Change of Ownership or Owner's Identity or Legal Status.



      1.   Notification of Change.  A utility shall notify the
Village no less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the transfer of
ownership of any facility in the right-of-way or change in identity of the
utility.  The new owner of the utility or the facility shall have all the
obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former owner under the permit, if
any, and applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this
Section, with respect to the work and facilities in the right-of-way.



      2.   Amended Permit.  A new owner shall request within thirty
(30) days of assuming its ownership responsibility that any current permit be
amended to show current ownership. If the new owner fails to have a new or
amended permit issued in its name, within said 30-day period, the new owner
shall be presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and
conditions of the permit if the new owner uses the facility or allows it to
remain on the Village's right-of-way.



      3.   Insurance and Bonding.  All required insurance coverage
or bonding must be changed to reflect the name of the new owner upon transfer.



   M.   General Construction Standards.



      1.   Standards and Principles.  All construction in the
right-of-way shall be consistent with applicable ordinances, codes, laws
rules and regulations, and commonly recognized and accepted traffic control
and construction principles, sound engineering judgment and, where
applicable, the principles and standards set forth in the following IDOT
publications, as amended from time to time:



         a)   Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge
Construction;



         b)   Supplemental Specifications and Recurring Special
Provisions;



         c)   Highway Design Manual;



         d)   Highway Standards Manual;



         e)   Standard Specifications for Traffic Control Items;



         f)   Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices
(92 Ill. Adm. Code § 545);



         g)   Flagger's Handbook; and



         h)   Work Site Protection Manual for Daylight
Maintenance Operations.



      2.   Interpretation of Municipal Standards and Principles. 
If a discrepancy exists between or among differing principles and standards
required by this Section, the Village Department of Public Works shall
determine, in the exercise of sound engineering judgment, which principles
apply and such decision shall be final. If requested, the Village Department
of Public Works shall state which standard or principle will apply to the
construction, maintenance, or operation of a facility in the future.



   N.   Traffic Control.



      1.   Minimum Requirements.  The Village's minimum
requirements for traffic protection are contained in IDOT's Illinois Manual
on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and this Code.



      2.   Warning Signs, Protective Devices, and Flaggers.  The
utility is responsible for providing and installing warning signs, protective
devices and flaggers, when necessary, meeting applicable federal, state, and
local requirements for protection of the public and the utility's workers
when performing any work on the rights-of-way.



      3.   Interference with Traffic.  All work shall be phased so
that there is minimum interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.



      4.   Notice When Access is Blocked. At least forty-eight (48)
hours prior to beginning work that will partially or completely block access
to any residence, business or institution, the utility shall notify the
resident, business or institution of the approximate beginning time and
duration of such work; provided, however, that in cases involving emergency
repairs pursuant to Sub-Section T. of this Section, the utility shall provide
such notice as is practicable under the circumstances.



      5.   Compliance.  The utility shall take immediate action to
correct any deficiencies in traffic protection requirements that are brought
to the utility's attention by the Village.



   O.   Location of Facilities.



      1.   General Requirements. In addition to location
requirements applicable to specific types of utility facilities, all utility
facilities, regardless of type, shall be subject to the general location
requirements of this subsection.



         a)   No Interference with Village Facilities.  No
utility facilities shall be placed in any location if the Village Department
of Public Works determines that the proposed location will require the
relocation or displacement of any of the Village's utility facilities or will
otherwise interfere with the operation or maintenance of any of the Village's
utility facilities.



         b)   Minimum Interference and Impact.  The proposed
location shall cause only the minimum possible interference with the use of
the right-of-way and shall cause only the minimum possible impact upon, and
interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners
who adjoin said right-of-way.



         c)   No Interference with Travel.  No utility facility
shall be placed in any location that interferes with the usual travel on such
right-of-way.



         d)   No Limitations on Visibility.  No utility facility
shall be placed in any location so as to limit visibility of or by users of
the right-of-way.



         e)   Size of Utility Facilities.  The proposed
installation shall use the smallest suitable vaults, boxes, equipment
enclosures, power pedestals, and/or cabinets then in use by the facility
owner, regardless of location, for the particular application.



      2.   Appearance Standards.



         1)   The Village may prohibit the installation of
facilities in particular locations in order to preserve visual quality.



         2)   A facility may be constructed only if its
construction does not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or
terrain features visible to the right-of-way user or to adjacent residents
and property owners, and if it does not impair the aesthetic quality of the
lands being traversed.



         3)   Underground utilities are required for all new
construction on private property and are required in the following locations
as part of any regional road reconstruction or widening project: La Grange
Road from 131st Street to Interstate 80, 159th Street from 71st Court to
Ravinia Avenue, Harlem Avenue from 151st Street to 159th Street, and Ravinia
Avenue from 142nd Street to 163rd Street.  (Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



      3.   Parallel Facilities Located Within Highways.



         a)   Overhead Parallel Facilities.  An overhead
parallel facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway
only if:



            (1)   Lines are located as near as practicable to
the right-of-way line and as nearly parallel to the right-of-way line as
reasonable pole alignment will permit;



            (2)   Where pavement is curbed, poles are as
remote as practicable from the curb with a minimum distance of two feet (0.6
m) behind the face of the curb, where available;



            (3)   Where pavement is uncurbed, poles are as
remote from pavement edge as practicable with minimum distance of four feet
(1.2 m) outside the outer shoulder line of the roadway and are not within the
clear zone;



            (4)   No pole is located in the ditch line of a
highway; and



            (5)   Any ground-mounted appurtenance is located
within one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as possible to
the right-of-way line.



         b)   Underground Parallel Facilities.  An underground
parallel facility may be located within the right-of-way lines of a highway
only if:



            (1)   The facility is located as near the

one foot (0.3 m) of the right-of-way line or as near as practicable.



      4.   Facilities Crossing Highways.



         a)   No Future Disruption.  The construction and design
of crossing facilities installed between the ditch lines or curb lines of
Village highways may require the incorporation of materials and protections
(such as encasement or additional cover) to avoid settlement or future
repairs to the roadbed resulting from the installation of such crossing
facilities.



         b)   Cattle Passes, Culverts, or Drainage Facilities. 
Crossing facilities shall not be located in cattle passes, culverts, or
drainage facilities.



         c)   90 Degree Crossing Required.  Crossing facilities
shall cross at or as near to a ninety (90) degree angle to the centerline as
practicable.



         d)   Overhead Power or Communication Facility. An
overhead power or communication facility may cross a highway only if:

            (2)   Capacity for the utility's foreseeable
future expansion needs is provided in the initial installation.



         f)   Markers.  The Village may require the utility to
provide a marker at each right-of-way line where an underground facility
other than a power or communication facility crosses a highway.  Each marker
shall identify the type of facility, the utility, and an emergency phone
number.  Markers may also be eliminated as provided in current Federal
regulations.  (49 C.F.R. §192.707 (1989)).



      5.   Facilities to be Located Within Particular
Rights-of-Way.  The Village may require that facilities be located within
particular rights-of-way that are not highways, rather than within particular
highways.



      6.   Freestanding Facilities.



         a)   The Village may restrict the location and size of
any freestanding facility located within a right-of-way, or other public
places.



         b)   All freestanding facilities located within a
right-of-way shall be located underground to the greatest extent possible, as
determined by the Development Services Department, and to the extent that the
Development Services Department determines that it is not technically
possible to install any such facilities underground, such facilities shall be
substantially screened from view by landscaping pursuant to a landscaping
plan which shall be approved in advance by the Development Services
Department.  A utility shall screen any facility, lawfully established
within a right-of-way prior to the effective date of this Section, within a
reasonable period of time not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar
days after notification from the Village to screen that specific facility.
(Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



         c)   All freestanding facilities within any right-of-way
shall be so located so as to cause only the minimum possible interference
with the use of such right-of-way.  No freestanding facilities shall be
placed within any right-of-way in such a manner to interfere with the usual
travel on such right-of-way, nor shall such facilities limit the visibility
of vehicular and/or pedestrian traffic within such right-of-way.



         d)   The owner of any freestanding facility shall
promptly comply with the reasonable requests of the Development Services
Department with respect to the location and screening of such facilities
within any right-of-way.  (Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



      7.   Facilities Installed Above Ground.  Above ground
facilities may be installed only if:



         a)   No other existing facilities in the area are
located underground;



         b)   New underground installation is not technically
feasible; and



         c)   The proposed installation will be made at a
location, and will employ suitable design and materials, to provide the
greatest protection of aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed
without adversely affecting safety.  Suitable designs include, but are not
limited to, self-supporting armless, single-pole construction with vertical
configuration of conductors and cable.  Existing utility poles and light
standards shall be used wherever practicable; the installation of additional
utility poles is strongly discouraged.



      8.   Facility Attachments to Bridges or Roadway Structures.



         a)   Facilities may be installed as attachments to
bridges or roadway structures only where the utility has demonstrated that
all other means of accommodating the facility are not practicable.  Other
means shall include, but are not limited to, underground, underwater,
independent poles, cable supports and tower supports, all of which are
completely separated from the bridge or roadway structure. Facilities
transmitting commodities that are volatile, flammable, corrosive, or
energized, especially those under significant pressure or potential, present
high degrees of risk and such installations are not permitted.



         b)   A utility shall include in its request to
accommodate a facility installation on a bridge or roadway structure
supporting data demonstrating the impracticability of alternate routing. 
Approval or disapproval of an application for facility attachment to a bridge
or roadway structure will be based upon the following considerations:



            (1)   The type, volume, pressure or voltage of the
commodity to be transmitted and an evaluation of the resulting risk to
persons and property  in the event of damage to or failure of the facility;



            (2)   The type, length, value, and relative
importance of the highway structure in the transportation system;



            (3)   The alternative routings available to the
utility and their comparative practicability;



            (4)   The proposed method of attachment;



            (5)   The ability of the structure to bear the
increased load of the proposed facility;



            (6)   The degree of interference with bridge
maintenance and painting;



            (7)   The effect on the visual quality of the
structure; and



            (8)   The public benefit expected from the utility
service as compared to the risk involved.

reconstructed with a concrete surface/base in the last seven (7) years, or
resurfaced in the last three (3) years, pavement cut permits shall not be
issued unless such work is determined to be an emergency repair or other work
considered necessary and unforeseen before the time of the reconstruction or
unless a pavement cut is necessary for a J.U.L.I.E. locate.



         e)   Encasement.



            (1)   Casing pipe shall be designed to withstand
the load of the highway and any other superimposed loads.  The casing shall
be continuous either by one-piece fabrication or by welding or jointed
installation approved by the Village.



            (2)   In the case of water main or service
crossing, encasement shall be furnished between bore pits unless continuous
pipe or Village approved jointed pipe is used under the roadway.  Casing may
be omitted only if pipe is installed prior to highway construction and
carrier pipe is continuous or mechanical joints are of a type approved by the
Village.  Bell and spigot type pipe shall be encased regardless of
installation method.



            (3)   In the case of gas pipelines of 60 psig or

trimming that is done by any other utility with facilities in the
right-of-way and that is not performed pursuant to applicable Illinois laws
and regulations specifically governing same, shall not be considered a normal
maintenance operation, but shall require the application for, and the
issuance of, a permit, in addition to any other permit required under this
Section.



         a)   Application for Tree Trimming Permit. 
Applications for tree trimming permits shall include assurance that the work
will be accomplished by competent workers with supervision who are
experienced in accepted tree pruning practices.  Tree trimming permits shall
designate an expiration date in the interest of assuring that the work will
be expeditiously accomplished.



         b)   Damage to Trees.  Poor pruning practices resulting
in damaged or misshapen trees is not permitted and shall be grounds for
cancellation of the tree trimming permit and for assessment of damages.  The
Village will require compensation for trees extensively damaged. The formula
developed by the International Society of Arboriculture will be used as a
basis for determining the compensation for damaged trees.  The Village may
require the removal and replacement of trees if trimming or radical pruning
would leave them in an unacceptable condition. For tree removal see Section
6-305.1 Tree Preservation. (Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



      3.   Specimen Trees or Trees of Special Significance.  The

will not be permitted on rights-of-way unless the utility demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Department of Public Works that such spraying is the only
practicable method of vegetation control.



   R.   Removal, Relocation, or Modifications of Utility Facilities.



      1.   Notice.  Within ninety (90) days following written
notice from the Village, a utility shall, at its own expense, protect,
support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove, relocate, change or
alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way
whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal,
relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the
construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any Village improvement
in or upon, or the operations of the Village in or upon, the rights-of-way.



      2.   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities.  Within thirty (30)
days following written notice from the Village, any utility that owns,
controls, or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances
within the rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of
such facilities or appurtenances from the rights-of-way.  A facility is
unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:



         a)   Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's
license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law;



         b)   If the facility was constructed or installed
without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required;

         d)   If the facility was constructed or installed at a
location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise.



      3.   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The
Village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located
within the rights-of-way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety
emergency.  If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to
notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and
shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility.



      4.   Abandonment of Facilities.  Upon abandonment of a
facility within the rights-of-way of the Village, the utility shall notify
the Village within ninety (90) days.  Following receipt of such notice the
Village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility
if the Village Department of Public Works determines that such removal will
be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare.  In the
event that the Village does not direct the utility that abandoned the
facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the Village, the
abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of
all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.



   S.   Clean-up and Restoration.



      The utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf
and terrain and other property within ten (10) calendar days after any
portion of the rights-of-way are disturbed, damaged or destroyed due to
construction or maintenance by the utility, all to the satisfaction of the
Village.  This includes restoration of entrances and side roads. Restoration
of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the
Village Department of Public Works.  Such cleanup and repair may be required
to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other
requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially
equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project. 
The time period provided in this Sub-Section may be extended by the Village
Department of Public Works for good cause shown.

      1.   General.  Facilities on, over, above, along, upon,
under, across, or within rights-of-way are to be maintained by or for the
utility in a manner satisfactory to the Village and at the utility's expense.



      2.   Emergency Maintenance Procedures.  Emergencies may
justify non-compliance with normal procedures for securing a permit:



         a)   If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled
portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to
provide all necessary protection for traffic on the highway or the public on
the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or
flaggers.  If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of
the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment
required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. 
Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no
other means of access to the facility is available.



         b)   In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as
possible, notify the Village Department of Public Works of the emergency,
informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the
traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. 
If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement
of traffic, the Village police shall be notified immediately.



         c)   In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at
hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least
inconvenience to the traveling public.



      3.   Emergency Repairs.  The utility must file in writing
with the Village a description of the repairs undertaken in the right-of-way
within 48 hours after an emergency repair.



   U.   Variances.



      1.   Request for Variance.  A utility requesting a variance
from one or more of the provisions of this Section must do so in writing to
the Village Department of Public Works as a part of the permit application. 
The request shall identify each provision of this Section from which a
variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted.



      2.   Authority to Grant Variances.  The Village Department of
Public Works shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision
of this Section identified in the variance request on an individual basis.



      3.   Conditions for Granting of Variance.  The Village
Department of Public Works may authorize a variance only if the utility
requesting the variance has demonstrated that:



         a)   One or more conditions not under the control of the
utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a
special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable,
given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and



         b)   All other designs, methods, materials, locations or
facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is
requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach.



      4.   Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance.  As a
condition for authorizing a variance, the Village Department of Public Works
may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards
and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this Section
but which carry out the purposes of this Section.



      5.   Right to Appeal.  Any utility aggrieved by any order,
requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made
by the Village Department of Public Works under the provisions of this
Section shall have the right to appeal to the corporate authorities of the
Village, or such other board or commission as it may designate.  The
application for appeal shall be submitted in writing to the Village Clerk
within 30 days after the date of such order, requirement, decision or
determination.  The corporate authorities of the Village shall commence its
consideration of the appeal at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
corporate authorities of the Village occurring at least seven (7) days after
the filing of the appeal.  The corporate authorities of the Village shall
timely decide the appeal.



   V.   Penalties.



   Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply
with any of the provisions of this Section shall be subject to fine in
accordance with the penalty provisions of the Code.  There may be times when
the Village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims,
because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit
and this Section.  Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the
cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall
bear the Village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining,
modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the
permit.  No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule
a permit related cost apportionment of the Village. Sanctions may be imposed
upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.



   W.   Enforcement.



   Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting any additional
or further remedies that the Village may have for enforcement of this Section.



   X.   Severability.



   If any section, Sub-Section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or
portion of this Section is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions hereof.



(Ord. 4347 - 3/3/08)



ARTICLE 8:
NONCONFORMITITES



SECTION 8-101.   NONCONFORMITIES.



   A.   Purpose, Applicability.   The purpose of this Section is to
regulate and limit the continued existence of uses and structures established
prior to the effective date of these regulations that do not conform to these
regulations.  Any nonconformity created by a change in the classification of
property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the
provisions of this Section, with the "effective date" referenced below being
the date the text of these regulations or the Zoning Map is amended to render
a particular use, structure, or lot nonconforming.  Many nonconformities may
continue, but the provisions of this Section are designed to curtail
substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about their eventual
improvement or elimination in order to preserve the integrity of these
regulations.



   B.   Nonconforming Uses.



      1.   Nonconforming uses of land or structures, and
nonconforming structures that contain nonconforming uses, may continue only
in accordance with the provisions of this Section.



      2.   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow
the continuation of a nonconforming use.



      3.   A nonconforming use shall not be expanded, nor shall a
nonconforming use be enlarged by additions to the structure in which the
nonconforming use is located or the occupation of additional lands, unless
its nonconforming status is removed pursuant to Subsection F, or it complies
with the terms of Subsection C(4) below.



      4.   A structure in which a nonconforming use is located shall
not be moved unless the use thereafter conforms to the standards of the
zoning district or districts to which it is moved.



      5.   Except as provided in Subsection F, a nonconforming use
shall not be changed to any other use unless the new use conforms to the
standards of the zoning district in which it is located.  Once a
nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the nonconforming use shall
not be re-established.



      6.   Where a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned
for six (6) consecutive months or displaced for any period of time due to
structural damage under Subsection (7) below, then the use shall not be
re-established or resumed, and any subsequent use of the land or structure
shall conform to the requirements of these regulations.



      7.   Where a building or structure in which a nonconforming
use is located is destroyed or damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of its
gross building area, then the structure may be repaired or restored only for
uses which conform to the standards of these regulations for the zoning
district in which it is located. In the event that such damage or destruction
is less than fifty percent (50%) of the gross building area, repairs or
construction must be diligently pursued to completion and must be started
within one (1) year from the date of the partial destruction.



   C.   Nonconforming Structures.



      1.   A nonconforming structure devoted to a use permitted in
the zoning district in which it is located may continue only in accordance
with the provisions of this Section.



      2.   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow
the continuation of nonconforming structures.



      3.   Except as provided in Subsection (4) or in Subsection F
below, a nonconforming structure shall not be expanded.



      4.   A nonconforming structure may be reconstructed or
expanded:



         a.   if it is nonconforming solely because of its
failure to comply with the off-street parking requirements of Section 6-306
of these regulations, and the enlargement will not increase the required
amount of off-street parking by more than three (3) additional spaces;



         b.   if the expansion will not increase the degree of
nonconformity;



         c.   if the structure is nonconforming as to its setback
and is located within the Old Orland Historic District; or



         d.   if it is nonconforming due to the use of government
exercising the powers of eminent domain and the reconstruction or expansion
conforms to zoning requirements. 



         This provision excludes the expansion of non-conforming
signs.  (Amd. Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



      5.   A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it
thereafter conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is
located.



      6.   Where a nonconforming structure is abandoned for twelve
(12) consecutive months, then the structure shall be removed or modified to
conform to the requirements of these regulations. (Amd. Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



      7.   Any part of a nonconforming structure which is destroyed
or damaged to less than    fifty (50) percent of the assessed value of such
structure may be repaired or restored if a building permit or a sign permit
for the repair or restoration is issued within six (6) months of the date of
the damage.  Any nonconforming structure which is destroyed or damaged to
fifty percent (50%) or more of its assessed value may be repaired or 
restored only if the structure conforms to the standards of these regulations
for the    zoning district in which it is located.  Assessed value shall
be determined by      reference to the official property tax assessment
rolls for the year the structure is      destroyed or damaged.  The
extent of damage or destruction shall be determined by the Village Engineer
by comparing the estimated cost of repairs or restoration with    the
assessed value.  (Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



      8.   No conforming sign shall be erected on the same premises
as an existing nonconforming sign until the nonconforming sign has been
removed or changed to a conforming sign.  However, in commercial retail
establishments, the fact that one particular establishment therein has a
nonconforming sign will not prohibit a different establishment therein from
erecting a conforming sign on the same premises.



      9.   A sign approved prior to December 12, 1977 will be
allowed to remain as non-conforming structures as long as the sign remains in
good repair.  If such sign is damaged beyond 50% of its size or destroyed,
or if the sign undergoes a change of use or ownership, the sign must
thereupon be removed or brought into conformance within six (6) months. 
(Ord. 3281 - 8/16/99 & Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00)



      10.   For signs approved subsequent to December 12, 1977, no
modification or replacement is required of the owner of the sign on February
3, 1992.  If the sign is damaged beyond 50% of its size or destroyed, the
replacement sign shall be required to conform with these regulations.  (Ord.
3281 - 8/16/99)



      11.   Any sign that was not previously approved by the Village
and that does not conform to these regulations (illegal signs) shall be
immediately removed at the expense of its owner.



   D.   Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Accessory Structures.



      1.   No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure
shall continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by
abandonment, damage, or destruction unless such accessory use or accessory
structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning
district in which it is located.



      2.   A nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure may
be expanded only if the nonconforming features of that use or structure are
not expanded so as to increase the degree of nonconformity.



      3.   Any nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure
shall be brought into conformity with these regulations whenever a
substantial improvement to, addition to, or change in the principal use or
structure on the property is proposed and approved.



      4.   In no event shall a nonconforming accessory use or
accessory structure continue later than five-and-one-half (5-1/2) years from
the effective date of these regulations.



   E.   Nonconforming Vacant Lots.



      1.   Except as provided below in Subsection (2), a
nonconforming vacant lot may be used for any of the uses permitted by these
regulations in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the
use meets all limitations and minimum requirements for setbacks, height, open
space, and floor area established in these regulations for the zoning
district in which the lot is located.



      2.   If two adjacent nonconforming vacant lots are combined
under single ownership, and the combination results in the creation of a
single lot that is more than one-and-one-half (1 1/2) times the width or area
required in the zoning district, then the joint lot may be divided into two
(2) lots of equal width and area without being further classified as
nonconforming. (Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



   F.   Termination of Status as a Nonconformity.



      1.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections B and C
above prohibiting the continuation, reconstruction, or expansion of
nonconforming uses and structures, a nonconforming use or structure may be
deemed to be in conformity with these regulations, and may be allowed to
continue and to expand as a lawfully existing use or structure, through the
issuance of a special use permit in accordance with the provisions of this
Section.



      2.   To establish a nonconforming use or structure as a
lawfully existing use or structure, the owner of the property, or his or her
authorized agent, shall apply for a special use permit in accordance with the
procedures established in Chapter 5-105 of these regulations.



      3.   A special use permit shall not be issued for the
nonconforming use or structure unless it is to be improved according to the
following requirements:



         a.   A buffer conforming to the standards of Section
6-305 shall be provided between the nonconforming use or structure and any
abutting lot.  Where the nonconforming use or structure is residential and
the adjacent lot is located in a residential or agricultural district, a
Class C buffer shall be provided.  Where the nonconforming use or structure
is residential and the adjacent lot is located in a district other than a
residential or agricultural district, a Class D buffer shall be provided. 
Where the nonconforming use or structure is non-residential and the adjacent
lot is located in a residential or agricultural district, a Class D buffer
shall be provided.  Where the non-conforming use or structure is
non-residential and the adjacent lot is located in a district other than a
residential or agricultural district, a Class C buffer shall be provided. 
(Ord. 4610 - 12/20/10)



         b.   Any off-street parking area located on the lot
shall be improved to meet the landscaping standards established in Section
6-305 for the zoning district in which the parking area is located.



         c.   Any nonconforming sign, outdoor lighting,
off-street parking area, or other accessory structure or accessory use
located on the lot shall be terminated, removed, or brought into conformity
with these regulations.



         d.   No nonconforming structure shall be expanded so as
to increase the degree of nonconformity, such as by further encroachment into
a required setback.



         e.   Any expansion to the nonconforming use or structure
shall meet all off-street parking requirements, bulk regulations, and other
requirements established by these regulations for that use or structure and
the zoning district in which it is located.



      4.   Upon determining that the nonconforming use or structure
satisfies all of the above requirements, the Board of Trustees shall approve
that use or structure or for the expansion of that use or structure.  Upon
receipt of the special use permit the use or structure shall no longer be
treated as a nonconformity and shall be allowed to continue as a lawfully
existing use or structure unless the structure is abandoned for twelve (12)
consecutive months or the use is discontinued for three (3) consecutive years
or is destroyed or damaged to 100 percent of its assessed value.  This
status as a lawfully existing use shall apply only to the specific use or
structure for which the permit is issued and not to any other use or
structure that may be located on the lot. (Ord. 4926 - 9/15/14)



      5.   In no event shall the use or structure be allowed to
expand to greater than fifty percent (50%) of the floor area or lot area that
it occupied on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective
date of any amendment to these regulations which rendered the use or
structure nonconforming.



ARTICLE 9:
ENFORCEMENT



SECTION 9-101.   ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES.



   The provisions of these regulations shall be enforced by the Village
Manager.  In addition to other remedies provided by these regulations and
other applicable laws, the Village Manager shall, when a violation has been
determined to exist:



   A.   Direct the Director of Development Services not to continue any
development review process for the developer until the violation has been
corrected;  (Ord. 3672  8/5/02; Amd. Ord. 5167  2/20/17)



   B.   Inform the violator that no further work under an existing
approval may proceed until the violation has been corrected.



      In the event that a violator has been previously determined to
have violated a provision of these regulations within the prior five (5)
years, the Development Services Director may require that the violator
implement appropriate mitigation measures for the site where the violation
was committed.  Such measures may include installation of landscaping and
requirements for posting a performance guarantee acceptable to the Village
such as cash bond, letter of credit or, at the discretion and approval of the
Board of Trustees, other security methods to ensure compliance with the order
of the Development Services Director. (Amd. Ord. 4996  6/15/15)



SECTION 9-102.   PENALTIES.



   Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits,
neglects, refuses to comply with, or who resists enforcement of any of the
provisions of these regulations shall upon conviction be fined not less than
two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) nor more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) for each offense.  Each day that a violation is permitted to
exist shall constitute a separate offense.  (Ord. 3354 - 4/17/00; Amd. Ord.
5126 - 9/19/16)



   In the event any building or structure is used, erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure or land is used in violation of these regulations, the Village
Manager or any owner or tenant of real property in the same contiguous zoning
district as the building, structure or land in question, in addition to other
remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding



      1.   To prevent the unlawful erection, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion,  maintenance, or use,



      2.   To prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or
land,



      3.   To prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in
or about the premises, or



      4.   To restrain, correct, or abate the violation.  When any
such action is instituted by an owner or tenant, notice of such action shall
be served upon the Village of Orland Park at the time suit is begun by
serving a copy of the complaint on the President of the Board of Trustees.



ARTICLE 10:
EFFECTIVE DATES AND SEVERABILITY



SECTION 10-101.   EFFECTIVE DATE.



   These regulations shall become and be effective immediately upon its
passage, approval and publication in the manner provided by law.



SECTION 10-102.   SEVERABILITY.



   If any section or specific provision or standard of these regulations
or any zoning district boundary that now exists or may exist in the future is
found by a court to be invalid for any reason, the decision of the court
shall not affect the validity of any other section, provision, standard, or
district boundary of these regulations except the provision in question. 
The other portions of these regulations not affected by the decision of the
court shall remain in full force and effect.
