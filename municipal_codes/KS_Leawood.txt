It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an individual or entity to discriminate against any individual in the terms, conditions or privileges of the sale or lease of real property including rental housing, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity or to discriminate against any individual in such individual's use or occupancy of rental housing because of the sexual orientation or gender identity of individuals with whom such individual associates. Nothing in this article shall prohibit a religious organization or any nonprofit institution or organization operated, supervised or controlled by or in conjunction with a religious organization, from limiting the sale, rental or occupancy of real property or rental housing which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose to individuals of the same religion, or from giving preference to such individuals.
(c) Public Accommodation. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for the owner, operator, lessee, manager, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation to refuse, deny or make a distinction, directly or indirectly, in offering its goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations to any individual because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
(d) Defenses. It shall be a defense to any allegation of an unlawful discriminatory practice brought hereunder:
1. that the individual or entity did not know or have reason to know of the aggrieved individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity;
Code of the City of Leawood
2. that the individual or entity acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing that an act or omission was not a violation of this ordinance; or
3. that any adverse action taken against the aggrieved individual would have been taken regardless of the individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity (i.e. the aggrieved individual violated the law, a workplace rule, a lease provision or policy applicable to all similarly situated individuals, such as employees, lessees, customers, etc.).
(e) Exceptions. Nothing in this article shall:
1. prohibit a fraternal or social association/corporation in fact not open to the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides lodging which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or from giving preference to its members.
2. prohibit an employer from requiring an employee, during the employee's hours at work, to adhere to reasonable dress or grooming standards not prohibited by other provisions of Federal, State, or local law.
3. require an employer to hire unqualified individuals or to retain employees when there is a legitimate non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory reason to terminate employment.
4. be construed to prohibit an employer from requiring all of its employees, as a condition of employment, to utilize the employer’s applicable established internal human resource procedure(s) to address any allegation of discrimination or retaliation in the workplace. The fact that an employer requires an employee to utilize the employer’s applicable established internal human resource procedure(s) to address any allegation of discrimination or retaliation in the workplace shall not, in itself, be deemed a violation of this article. However, an employee may simultaneously file a complaint with the city as provided in this ordinance; completion of the employer’s procedures is not a pre-requisite to filing a complaint with the city.
5. be construed to require any person or entity subject to this article to make changes requiring a building permit to any existing facility, except as otherwise required by law.
6. be construed to prohibit an employer or place of public accommodation to post signs for restrooms and dressing rooms based on gender.
7. be construed to prohibit or require an action in violation of a person’s rights protected by K.S.A. 60-5301 et seq.
8. be construed to make it lawful to discriminate or retaliate against individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, marital status, familial status, or military status. Such discrimination and retaliation is not addressed in this article because federal and state laws consistently address unlawful discriminatory and retaliatory practices related to those characteristics and provide appropriate procedures for addressing complaints for such discrimination and retaliation.

This requirement may be waived by the Public Works Director at his or her discretion for safety concerns, or some other good cause under the condition that does not cause discrimination among ROW-users.
If this requirement is waived, the facilities shall be located as directed by the Public Works Director, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding location and height. Above ground Facilities shall comply with the Public Improvement Construction Standards and all applicable zoning regulations, and be located in a manner that does not compromise the public health, safety or welfare. The height of any such facility will not exceed the lessor of:
1. 35 feet for residential or collector streets or 45 feet for arterial streets; and
2. 66 inches above the height of existing street light poles along the right-of-way surrounding the facility.

If a ROW-user desires to construct, maintain or operate facilities along such right-of-way, the Public Works Director may require the ROW-user to use such conduit, and to contribute to the expense of such conduit, provided, however, the ROW-user use of the conduit is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances.
Code of the City of Leawood
(j) All earth, materials, sidewalks, paving, crossings, utilities, other public improvements or improvements of any kind damaged or removed by the ROW-user shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by the ROW-user at its sole expense and to the reasonable satisfaction of the City.

A ROW-user shall not construct or reconstruct any of its facilities located upon, over, under or within the City right-of-way without first having submitted in writing a description of its planned improvement to the Public Works Director and having received a permit for such improvement. The Public Works Director may require that any drawings, plans and/or specifications submitted be certified by a Kansas registered professional engineer stating that such drawings, plans and/or specifications comply with all applicable technical codes, rules and regulations, unless such plans are based directly on nationally recognized codes, which are appropriately cited, and attested to on the plans by the signature of an authorized official of the organization applying for the permit.

13-337. PLACEMENT OF GATES ON PUBLIC STREETS.
(a) Intent. It is the stated policy of the Governing Body of the City of Leawood, Kansas, that the installation of limited access gates between residential subdivisions is not in the overall general interest of the citizens of Leawood and its neighboring communities. The installation of a limited access gate should be a rare exception with any installation being clearly demonstrated to the Governing Body by professional documentation that the positive impact of such an installation significantly exceeds the potential detrimental impact created by the presence of the limited access gate. Additionally, any limited access gate permitted and installed subsequent to the effective date of this ordinance, should be subject to periodic review with regard to maintenance.
(b) Gates prohibited; exceptions. Subject to the terms of this section, no person or entity shall install or maintain a limited access gate on or along any public street. Limited access gates installed prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be subject to the terms of this ordinance. Limited access gates on public streets may only be installed upon approval of the Governing Body.
(c) Procedure for approval. A person or entity desiring to install a limited access gate on or along a public street shall provide information and documentation to the City Administrator proving the following factors:
(1) The City has not previously decided that a limited access gate located at or near the site should be denied;
(2) The street connection involved has been constructed;
(3) There are at least two existing unobstructed access points within any directly affected subdivision;
(4) The furthest linear travel surface distance between the closest unobstructed access point and any home site is less than or equal to 1,500 feet;
Code of the City of Leawood
(5) The magnitude of the density, defined as dwelling unit per acre, between the affected subdivisions varies by at least 50%;
If the City Administrator determines that these factors have been met, then the applicant shall remit to the City the amount necessary for the City to commission a traffic study to evaluate the vehicle and pedestrian traffic and the capacity of the street design and street construction of the affected streets with and without having the proposed limited access gate. The study shall then be distributed to any directly affected neighboring city and subdivision, with a request for a formal response by a date certain. Upon expiration of the date certain, the City Administrator shall make a recommendation as to compliance with these conditions and shall compile this information and his findings and shall submit the information to the Planning Director. The applicant may then, upon filing the proper development application and fees, proceed with a proposed final development plan amendment with the Planning Commission.
If the City Administrator finds that any of the above referenced elements have not been met, then the applicant may not proceed with a request for amendment to the final development plan. The City Administrator shall inform the applicant of this decision. The applicant may then seek appeal to the Governing Body and the matter shall be scheduled on the next available agenda for hearing. If the Governing Body by majority vote of its membership determines that the factors have been met, then the applicant may proceed with filing the proper development application and fees necessary to request amendment to its final development plan.

Trees are long-lived and their services and value improve with age. For these reasons, Street Trees are recoginized as important green infrastructure in our community. Examples of how Street Trees provide services to our community include:
1. Street Trees improve air quality by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering out pollutants and providing oxygen.
2. Street Trees preserve and enhance the physical and aesthetic environment.

13-604. APPLICABILITY OF IMPACT FEE.
(a) This Ordinance shall be uniformly applicable to residential and nonresidential development, but not public and quasi-public uses, on property in South Leawood which must be served by transportation improvements as a condition of development approval. For purposes of this Ordinance, property is "served by" transportation improvements when off-site secondary arterial street improvements are necessary in order to provide north-south and east-west access to and from the property via continuous, improved arterial streets. For purposes of this Ordinance, "improved arterial streets" means and refers to sec-ondary arterial streets identified on the Major Street Plan and constructed to secondary arterial street standards pursuant to applicable City regulations.
(b) This Ordinance shall be applicable to development occurring prior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to the initiation of transportation improvements in South Leawood as set forth in the Master Plan and Major Street Plan; provided, however, that such transportation improvements are actually provided within a reasonable period of time following payment of the Impact Fee imposed by this Ordinance.
(Ord. 1031C; 02-01-88)
13-605. IMPOSITION OF IMPACT FEE.
(a) No building permit for development to which this Ordinance is applicable shall be issued by the City nor shall any development subject to this Ordinance be granted final plat approval by the City unless the applicant therefor or the owner of the subject property has paid the applicable impact fee in full in the amount and manner prescribed herein, unless exempt or partially exempt pursuant to subsection (b) or Section 13-612 herein.
(b) The Impact Fee shall not be imposed on:
(1) residential or nonresidential development for which final plat approval had been granted by the City;
(2) nonresidential development for which a building permit has been issued by the City on or before the date of adoption of this ordinance; or
(3) residential development for which preliminary plat approval and rezoning has been granted by the City prior to November 2, 1987 and which approval and/or rezoning included stipulations imposed by the City which effectively prevented the applicant from submitting a final plat or plats for all or a portion of the proposed development prior to November 2, 1987.
Code of the City of Leawood
(c) Imposition of the Impact Fee does not alter, negate, supersede or otherwise affect any other requirements of City, County, State or Federal legislation or regulations that may be applicable to a development, including City zoning and/or subdivision regulations that may impose on-site or abutting arterial street improvement requirements, local or collector street improvement requirements, right-of-way dedication requirements, and/or design and construction standards for local, collector or arterial streets. Provided, however, that an applicant for development approval shall be eligible for a credit for the provision of arterial street improvements pursuant to Section 13-613 herein.
(d) Upon receipt of an application for a preliminary plat, the Director of Planning and Development shall preliminarily calculate the amount of the Impact Fee due by multiplying the Impact Fee rate by the number of gross acres in the proposed development for which subdivision approval is being sought and multiplying the product by the applicable Impact Fee coefficient. This calculation shall be an estimate only for the benefit of the applicant for subdivision approval and shall be subject to final determination at such time as the applicant for development requests final plat approval or a building permit is requested for nonresidential development for which a final plat is not required.
(Ord. 1031C; 02-01-88)
13-606. IMPACT FEE RATE. The Impact Fee Rate shall be established by Resolution of the City Council initially upon the adoption of this Ordinance, and thereafter as part of the annual review provided in Section 13-609 or at such other times as deemed necessary by the City. If no action is taken by the City Council to amend the Impact Fee Rate, the rate then in effect shall remain in effect.
(Ord. 1031C; 02-01-88)

Code of the City of Leawood
(d) In the annual review process, the Governing Body may take into consideration the following factors: inflation as measured by changes in an appropriate construction cost index used by the City; construction cost increases as measured by actual experience during the year; changes in the design, engineering, location, or other elements of proposed transportation improvements; revisions to the Comprehensive Plan and Major Street Plan; changes in the anticipated land use mix and/or intensity of development in South Leawood; and such other factors as may be deemed relevant and appropriate.

The Impact Fee requirement is intended to be consistent with and to further the objectives and policies of the Master Plan and Major Street Plan and to be coordinated with other City policies, ordinances and resolutions by which the City seeks to ensure the provision of an adequate street system in conjunction with the development of land. In no event shall a property owner be obligated to pay an Impact Fee in an amount in excess of the amount calculated pursuant to this Ordinance; but, provided that a property owner may be required, pursuant to City zoning and subdivision regulations to dedicate land and/or to construct or escrow money for the construction of local and collector streets and on-site and abutting arterial streets, to collector street standards, in addition to meeting the Impact Fee requirements set forth herein.

(Ord. 1839C, 01-03-00)
15-503. INTERPRETATIONS. The provisions of this article are intended to supplement existing zoning and land use ordinances of the City.

15-504. OBJECTIVES. To promote the public health, safety, protection of property and general welfare of the citizens of Leawood, this “Stormwater Management Ordinance” is enacted for the general purpose of assuring the proper balance between use of land and the preservation of a safe and beneficial environment. More specifically, the provisions of these regulations, as amended from time to time, are intended to reduce property damage and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding and erosion of soil through the following:
(a) Establishment of a Stormwater Management System.
(b) Definition and establishment of Stormwater Management Practice.
(c) Establishment of methods and guidelines for attenuating or avoiding flooding and erosion within the City from cumulative effects of increased volume and peak discharge of surface water runoff.
(d) Establishment of an appeal board to review disputed decisions of the Director of Public Works or Building Official and to resolve disputes regarding the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of this article.

(a) Development Design - Streets, blocks, depth of lots, parks, and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the velocity of overland flow and allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the ground, and to preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels and detention basins, and include, whenever possible, streams, and floodplains within park and other public grounds.
(b) Stormwater System Design - Unless otherwise provided by the Director of Public Works, the latest approved edition of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria, Division II, Section 2600, Construction and Material Specifications, adopted April 1996, (except Section 2602.2 B Corrugated Steel Pipe and Division V) and Section 5600, Storm Drainage Systems and Facilities, of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria, adopted February 15, 2006, prepared by the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter American Public Works Association or the latest edition as amended, which is by reference made a part hereof as though expressly rewritten and incorporated in the ordinance, shall govern the design and construction of storm sewer systems within the City except as otherwise noted herein.
(c) Methods of Controlling Downstream Flooding - The Stormwater Drainage Study shall identify downstream flooding impacts of the proposed development. If the Stormwater Drainage Study indicates the proposed development will cause or increase downstream local flooding conditions during the design storm, provisions to minimize such flooding conditions shall be included in the design of storm drainage improvements and/or the temporary controlled detention of stormwater runoff and its regulated discharge to the downstream storm drainage system.
(d) Downstream Improvements - Improvements to minimize downstream flooding conditions may include the construction of dams, dikes, levees, and floodwalls; culvert enlargements; and channel clearance and modification projects.
(1) Detention Basins - All detention basins shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 5608. All modeling of detention basins shall use either HEC-1 or the KU Penn State Runoff, (enhanced version PSRM Version 7) or subsequent editions, or as otherwise approved in advance by the City Engineer.
(2) Outlet Control Works - Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices and shall function without requiring attendance or control during operation. Size and hydraulic characteristics shall be such that all water in detention storage is released to the downstream storm drainage system within 24 hours after the end of the design rainfall.
Code of the City of Leawood
(e) Other Design Considerations - All stormwater detention basins shall be designed with the capability of passing a 100-year storm event from a fully developed watershed basin through the outlet works without causing failure of the embankment. It is not the intent of this requirement to entail any additional reduction of the peak runoff rate; but to assure the integrity and safety of the structure. All underground pipe systems to the detention basin shall tie directly into the outlet structure and not discharge directly into the basin unless waived by the Director of Public Works, in accordance with good engineering practices.
(f) Appearance - Pipes, drainage structures, outlet works, or other necessary structural features such as a fence and a gate of detention basins shall be devised so as to be minimum in number and inconspicuous.

(a) The purpose of this Code shall be to prevent the discharge of pollutants from land and activities within the City into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and/or into surface waters.
(b) The Governing Body of the City hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface waters, both through inappropriate non-stormwater discharges into the MS4 or the surface waters directly, and through the wash off and transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by stormwater during rainfall events.
(c) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals, particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation, recreation, and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals.
(d) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that this ordinance will promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system.
Code of the City of Leawood
(e) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental preservation.
(f) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that a reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on activities within the City is necessary to eliminate or minimize such discharges of pollutants, to protect the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value of existing water resources within the City and within downstream communities, and to comply with the provisions of the City's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the NPDES program.

ARTICLE 7. POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL
15-701. TITLE.
This Article 7 of Chapter 15 shall be known as the Post-Construction Storm Water Runoff Control Ordinance (“Ordinance”).
(Ord. 2287C; 12-17-07)
15-702. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
(a) The purpose of this Ordinance is to minimize and prevent the discharge of pollutants from developed land into the surface waters of the City by establishing reasonable requirements for the treatment of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment activities.
(b) The Governing Body finds that land development and the associated increases in impervious cover can increase the quantity and nature of pollutants carried by stormwater runoff, increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, aggravate stream channel erosion and sediment transport, alter the hydrologic response of watersheds, and degrade the ecological function of downstream rivers, creeks, streams, lakes and other water bodies.
(c) Further, the Governing Body finds that stormwater treatment facilities and requirements can minimize those impacts by reducing pollutant levels carried in stormwater runoff, removing or reducing the concentrations of those pollutants that are carried, reducing stream bank erosion, and by restoring stormwater runoff rates and volumes to levels closer to the pre-development hydrologic regimes.

(Ord. 1839C, 01-03-00)
15-503. INTERPRETATIONS. The provisions of this article are intended to supplement existing zoning and land use ordinances of the City. In their interpretations and application, the provisions herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, protection of property and general welfare and where a conflict occurs the most stringent interpretation will apply.
(Ord. 1839C, 01-03-00)
15-504. OBJECTIVES. To promote the public health, safety, protection of property and general welfare of the citizens of Leawood, this “Stormwater Management Ordinance” is enacted for the general purpose of assuring the proper balance between use of land and the preservation of a safe and beneficial environment. More specifically, the provisions of these regulations, as amended from time to time, are intended to reduce property damage and to minimize the hazards of personal injury and loss of life due to flooding and erosion of soil through the following:
(a) Establishment of a Stormwater Management System.
(b) Definition and establishment of Stormwater Management Practice.
(c) Establishment of methods and guidelines for attenuating or avoiding flooding and erosion within the City from cumulative effects of increased volume and peak discharge of surface water runoff.
(d) Establishment of an appeal board to review disputed decisions of the Director of Public Works or Building Official and to resolve disputes regarding the interpretation and implementation of the provisions of this article.

The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein establish minimum requirements, which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship.

(a) Development Design - Streets, blocks, depth of lots, parks, and other public grounds shall be located and laid out in such a manner as to minimize the velocity of overland flow and allow maximum opportunity for infiltration of stormwater into the ground, and to preserve and utilize existing and planned streams, channels and detention basins, and include, whenever possible, streams, and floodplains within park and other public grounds.
Code of the City of Leawood
(b) Stormwater System Design - Unless otherwise provided by the Director of Public Works, the latest approved edition of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria, Division II, Section 2600, Construction and Material Specifications, adopted April 1996, (except Section 2602.2 B Corrugated Steel Pipe and Division V) and Section 5600, Storm Drainage Systems and Facilities, of the Standard Specifications and Design Criteria, adopted February 15, 2006, prepared by the Kansas City Metropolitan Chapter American Public Works Association or the latest edition as amended, which is by reference made a part hereof as though expressly rewritten and incorporated in the ordinance, shall govern the design and construction of storm sewer systems within the City except as otherwise noted herein.
(c) Methods of Controlling Downstream Flooding - The Stormwater Drainage Study shall identify downstream flooding impacts of the proposed development. If the Stormwater Drainage Study indicates the proposed development will cause or increase downstream local flooding conditions during the design storm, provisions to minimize such flooding conditions shall be included in the design of storm drainage improvements and/or the temporary controlled detention of stormwater runoff and its regulated discharge to the downstream storm drainage system.
(d) Downstream Improvements - Improvements to minimize downstream flooding conditions may include the construction of dams, dikes, levees, and floodwalls; culvert enlargements; and channel clearance and modification projects.
(1) Detention Basins - All detention basins shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 5608. All modeling of detention basins shall use either HEC-1 or the KU Penn State Runoff, (enhanced version PSRM Version 7) or subsequent editions, or as otherwise approved in advance by the City Engineer.
(2) Outlet Control Works - Outlet works shall not include any mechanical components or devices and shall function without requiring attendance or control during operation. Size and hydraulic characteristics shall be such that all water in detention storage is released to the downstream storm drainage system within 24 hours after the end of the design rainfall.
(e) Other Design Considerations - All stormwater detention basins shall be designed with the capability of passing a 100-year storm event from a fully developed watershed basin through the outlet works without causing failure of the embankment. It is not the intent of this requirement to entail any additional reduction of the peak runoff rate; but to assure the integrity and safety of the structure. All underground pipe systems to the detention basin shall tie directly into the outlet structure and not discharge directly into the basin unless waived by the Director of Public Works, in accordance with good engineering practices.
Code of the City of Leawood
(f) Appearance - Pipes, drainage structures, outlet works, or other necessary structural features such as a fence and a gate of detention basins shall be devised so as to be minimum in number and inconspicuous.

(a) The purpose of this Code shall be to prevent the discharge of pollutants from land and activities within the City into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and/or into surface waters.
(b) The Governing Body of the City hereby finds that pollutants are discharged into surface waters, both through inappropriate non-stormwater discharges into the MS4 or the surface waters directly, and through the wash off and transport of pollutants found on the land and built surfaces by stormwater during rainfall events.
(c) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharge of pollutants may lead to increased risks of disease and harm to individuals, particularly children, who come into contact with the water; may degrade the quality of such water for human uses, such as drinking, irrigation, recreation, and industry; and may damage the natural ecosystems of rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands, leading to a decline in the diversity and abundance of plants and animals.
(d) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that this ordinance will promote public awareness of the hazards involved in the improper discharge of trash, yard waste, lawn chemicals, pet waste, wastewater, oil, petroleum products, cleaning products, paint products, hazardous waste, sediment and other pollutants into the storm drainage system.
(e) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that such discharges are inconsistent with the provisions and goals of the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and other federal and state requirements for water quality and environmental preservation.
(f) Further, the Governing Body of the City hereby finds that a reasonable establishment of restrictions and regulations on activities within the City is necessary to eliminate or minimize such discharges of pollutants, to protect the health and safety of citizens, to preserve economic and ecological value of existing water resources within the City and within downstream communities, and to comply with the provisions of the City's responsibilities under the Clean Water Act and the NPDES program.

ARTICLE 7. POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF CONTROL
15-701. TITLE.
This Article 7 of Chapter 15 shall be known as the Post-Construction Storm Water Runoff Control Ordinance (“Ordinance”).
(Ord. 2287C; 12-17-07)
15-702. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
(a) The purpose of this Ordinance is to minimize and prevent the discharge of pollutants from developed land into the surface waters of the City by establishing reasonable requirements for the treatment of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment activities.
(b) The Governing Body finds that land development and the associated increases in impervious cover can increase the quantity and nature of pollutants carried by stormwater runoff, increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, aggravate stream channel erosion and sediment transport, alter the hydrologic response of watersheds, and degrade the ecological function of downstream rivers, creeks, streams, lakes and other water bodies.
(c) Further, the Governing Body finds that stormwater treatment facilities and requirements can minimize those impacts by reducing pollutant levels carried in stormwater runoff, removing or reducing the concentrations of those pollutants that are carried, reducing stream bank erosion, and by restoring stormwater runoff rates and volumes to levels closer to the pre-development hydrologic regimes.

SECTION 8. Indemnity
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representative, while installing, repairing or maintaining Distribution Facilities in the Right-of-Way or in regards any action or inaction related to Grantee’s obligations set forth in this Franchise.

SECTION 16. Failure to Enforce.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Franchise Ordinance shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

c. Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City.

Further, Grantee is hereby granted the right to lease its Facilities in whole or in part to affiliates or third parties, provided that the Grantee maintains ownership of such Facilities. This contract Franchise shall not be construed, in any manner, as relieving lessees of their obligation to obtain a Contract franchise.
Code of the City of Leawood
b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property).
d. Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573.
e. This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.
SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
a. Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate its Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way.

Code of the City of Leawood
b. Grantee’s use of the Public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the City’s Ordinance for Managing the Use and Occupancy of Public Right-of-way, adopted as Ordinance No.1834C, and amendments thereto.
c. Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
a. In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.00 per Access line per month. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.
b. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.
c. Grantee shall pay on a quarterly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the quarter for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
d. Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement, or comparable documents showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
e. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
f. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.
Code of the City of Leawood
g. Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Contract franchise.
h. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001 and 17-1902, and amendments thereto. The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
i. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
Code of the City of Leawood
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee’s activities in the Public right-of-way.
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND.
a. During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the state of Kansas. Should Grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance:
1. Workers’ compensation as provided for under any worker’s compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers’ liability limit equal to the amount required by law.
2. Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee’s operations under this Contract franchise.
b. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.

Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force. Grantee shall provide thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of cancellation or material change to its insurance.

The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance.
SECTIOIN 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal.

Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.
Code of the City of Leawood
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
a. The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee’s rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee’s property in good repair.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

b. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.

Code of the City of Leawood
h. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City. The franchise fee is compensation pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(j) and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
i. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.

There is hereby granted to Grantee this nonexclusive Contract franchise to construct, maintain, extend and operate its Facilities along, across, upon or under any Public right-of-way for the purpose of supplying Telecommunication services to the consumers or recipients of such service located within the corporate boundaries of the City, for the term of this Contract franchise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Contract franchise.
b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the KCC.

c. Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.

Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.00 per Access line per month. The access line fee shall be a maximum of $2.25 per month per access line in 2006, a maximum of $2.50 per access line in 2009, and a maximum of $2.75 per access in line in 2012 and thereafter.

Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
d. Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement, or comparable documents, showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
Code of the City of Leawood
e.

The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
i. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
Code of the City of Leawood
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors.

Grantee acknowledges that, prior to any renewal of this Contract Franchise, as set forth below, that it shall produce the required bond or shall produce evidence that it has been unable to obtain a bond from three recognized surety companies. The City reserves its right to reject renewal of this Contract Franchise if Grantee is unable to provide such a bond.
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION.
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court’s final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.

Code of the City of Leawood
b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:

Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed the maximum Access line fee allowed by Statute. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.

c. Upon forty-five (45) days prior written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
d. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
Code of the City of Leawood

The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Ordinance.
g. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City.

h. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
Code of the City of Leawood
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.

Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.

SECTION 2. GRANT OF CONTRACT FRANCHISE.
a. There is hereby granted to Grantee this nonexclusive Contract franchise to construct, maintain, extend and operate its Facilities along, across, upon or under any Public right-of-way for the purpose of supplying Telecommunication services to the consumers or recipients of such service located within the corporate boundaries of the City, for the term of this Contract franchise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Contract franchise.
b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the KCC. Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property).
d. Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573.
e. This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.
SECTION 3. USE OF PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
a. Pursuant to K.S.A. 17-1902, and amendments thereto, and subject to the provisions of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have the right to construct, maintain and operate it Facilities along, across, upon and under the Public right-of-way. Such Facilities shall be so constructed and maintained as not to obstruct or hinder the usual travel or public safety on such public ways or obstruct the legal use by other utilities.
Code of the City of Leawood
b. Grantee’s use of the Public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the City’s Ordinance for Managing the Use and Occupancy of Public Right-of-way, adopted as Ordinance No.1834C, and amendments thereto.
c. Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
a. In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.75 per access in line. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.
b. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.
c. Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the month for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
d. Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement, or comparable documents, showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
e. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
f. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.
Code of the City of Leawood
g. Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Contract franchise.
h. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City under K.S.A. 12-2001 and 17-1902, and amendments thereto. The franchise fee is compensation for use of the Public right-of-way and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
i. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a contract franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
Code of the City of Leawood
Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee’s activities in the Public right-of-way.
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND
a. During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the state of Kansas. Should Grantee elect to use the services of an affiliated captive insurance company for this purpose, that company shall possess a certificate of authority from the Kansas Insurance Commissioner. Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance:
1. Workers’ compensation as provided for under any worker’s compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers’ liability limit equal to the amount required by law.
2. Commercial general and umbrella liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee’s operations under this Contract franchise.
b. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.
c. Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and shall endeavor that said insurance will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice. Grantee shall make available to the City on request the policy declarations page and a certified copy of the policy in effect, so that limitations and exclusions can be evaluated for appropriateness of overall coverage.
Code of the City of Leawood
d. Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a performance bond in the amount of $50,000, payable to the City to ensure the appropriate and timely performance in the construction and maintenance of Facilities located in the Public right-of-way. The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance. Grantee has represented to the City that it is currently unable to obtain such a bond but has, in lieu of bond, provided a Letter of Credit naming the City of Leawood as beneficiary, in the amount of $50,000.00, issued by Citibank, irrevocable and automatically extended without amendment for additional periods if necessary, for the length of this franchise, in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Grantee acknowledges that, prior to any renewal of this Contract Franchise, as set forth below, that it shall produce the required bond or shall produce evidence that it has been unable to obtain a bond from three recognized surety companies. The City reserves its right to reject renewal of this Contract Franchise if Grantee is unable to provide such a bond.
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION.
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court’s final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.
Code of the City of Leawood
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
a. The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a customer of Grantee and as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee’s rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee’s property in good repair.
b. In granting its consent hereunder, the City does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, its Home Rule powers under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City.
c. In granting its consent hereunder, Grantee does not in any manner waive its regulatory or other rights and powers under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Kansas as the same may be amended, or under the Constitution of the State of Kansas, nor any of its rights and powers under or by virtue of present or future ordinances of the City.
d. In entering into this Contract franchise, neither the City's nor Grantee's present or future legal rights, positions, claims, assertions or arguments before any administrative agency or court of law are in any way prejudiced or waived.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee.
SECTION 10. TERM AND TERMINATION DATE.
a. This Contract franchise shall be effective for a term of two (2) years from the effective date of this Contract franchise.

c.

Code of the City of Leawood
This franchise does not provide franchisee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator [as defined by 47 USC § 522(5)] within the City. Upon franchisee’s request for a franchise to provide cable service as a cable operator [as defined by 47 USC § 522(5)] within the City, the City agrees to timely negotiate such franchise in good faith with franchisee.

Section 3. Use of Public Right-of-Way and Utility Easements. Franchisee’s facilities shall be located in the right-of-way and utility easements as now constructed and as further authorized by the City in accordance with all applicable laws, statutes and/or ordinances.

Placement, changes, additions, replacements, maintenance and repairs to franchisee’s facilities shall be conducted in compliance with any applicable ordinance and/or permit requirement. Franchisee will be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits as required by the City for work performed in the right-of-way and utility easements, as well as paying any associated permit fee. In addition, franchisee shall be subject to all technical specifications, design criteria, policies now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by the City, or any other appropriate governmental entity. In its use of the right-of-way and utility easements within the City, franchisee shall be subject to all right-of–way management ordinances and all other applicable rules, regulations, policies, laws, orders, resolutions, and ordinances now or hereafter adopted or promulgated by any appropriate governmental entity now or hereafter having jurisdiction, including, but not limited to the City in the reasonable exercise of its police powers.

In the event the City is required by to disclose such information, the City shall provide franchisee seven [7] days advance notice of its intent to disclose such information and shall take such action as may be reasonably required to cooperate with the franchisee to safeguard such information. The City shall also have access to and the right to examine, at all reasonable times, all books, receipts, files, records and documents of the franchisee necessary to verify the correctness of such statement and to correct the same, if found to be erroneous. If such statement of gross revenues is incorrect, then such payment shall be made upon such corrected statement, including interest on said amount at the annual rate of ten [10%] percent.
Regardless of whether franchisee is providing service within the City, the City’s acceptance of any payment determined as hereinbefore provided to be deficient shall not be construed as a release of liability from the City or an accord or satisfaction of any claim that the City may have for additional sums owed by franchisee. In addition to access to the records of franchisee for audits, upon request, franchisee shall provide reasonable access to records necessary to verify compliance with the terms of this franchise ordinance.
Section 6. Term. This franchisee ordinance shall be effective for a term of one [1] year from the effective date.
Section 7. Renegotiation of Franchise. If the City has a good faith belief that franchisee is offering local telecommunications services within the City beyond those telecommunications services contemplated by this ordnance, the City may seek renegotiation of this franchise if the City reasonably believes that such services constitute local telecommunications services subject to a franchise fee under K.S.A. § 12-2001. In the event the City seeks renegotiation under such circumstances, franchisee agrees to negotiate with the City in good faith in a timely manner. Nothing herein shall preclude the City from seeking a separate franchise agreement with franchisee if the City has a good faith belief that franchisee is offering services other than telecommunications services that are subject to a franchise fee under K.S.A. § 12-2001. The purpose of this provision is to allow the City to ensure that franchisee is paying a franchise fee for all services for which a franchise fee is appropriate.

City approval may be denied only upon a good faith finding by the City that the assignee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform its obligations in accordance with this franchise ordinance or any other appropriate governmental requirement. If franchisee should seek approval to assign this franchise, franchisee shall notify the City in writing. All such assignments shall be in writing and authenticated copies thereof shall be filed with the City Clerk. This franchise shall be assignable only in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas, as the same may exist at the time when any assignment is made. Any attempts to transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the rights granted herein by the City or franchisee’s facilities not conforming with the requirements of this section shall be null and void.
Section 13. Other Service Providers. Franchisee shall not interfere with any agreement between the City and another service provider. Additionally, if and when the City requires or negotiates to have another service provider cease to use its existing poles and to relocate its facilities underground, all other service providers using the same poles, including franchisee when applicable, shall also relocate their facilities underground at that time; provided, however, that such placement is economically reasonable. The City shall not unreasonably enter into such an agreement with another service provider, and notice of any intent to enter into such an agreement shall be timely provided to franchisee.

The City agrees to immediately notify franchisee of any such claim, demand, suit, proceeding, and/or action, by providing written notice via certified mail to franchisee. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the City, or any agent from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at their own expense.

The City shall have the right to waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state law, if the City determines: [a] that it is in the public interest to do so; and [b] that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on franchisee or its subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the City. The waiver of any provision in any one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this franchise ordinance unless the statement so recites.

If, within such thirty [30] day period, the franchisee does institute an action, as above provided, and prosecutes such action to final judgment with due diligence, then, if the Court finds that the franchise is subject to cancellation by the reason addressed by this section, this franchise shall immediately terminate after such final judgment is rendered and all available appeals exhausted.
Section 21. Miscellaneous Provisions.
a. Nonexclusive Clause. The privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain franchisee’s facilities and to provide service within the City is nonexclusive.

b. The grant of this usage of the Public right-of-way by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated herein. It does not:
Code of the City of Leawood
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property).
d. Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573.
e. This authority shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.

The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory.

Code of the City of Leawood
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
a. In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.00 per Access line per month. The access line fee shall be a maximum of $2.25 per month per access line in 2006, a maximum of $2.50 per access line in 2009, and a maximum of $2.75 per access in line in 2012 and thereafter. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.
b. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.
c. Grantee shall pay on a monthly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the quarter for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
d. Upon written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City either a 9K2 (gross receipts) or 9KN (access lines) statement, or comparable documents, showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
e. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
f. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.

h. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City. The franchise fee is compensation pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(j) and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
Code of the City of Leawood
i. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage by its negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee’s activities in the Public right-of-way.
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND

Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance:
Code of the City of Leawood
1. Workers’ compensation as provided for under any worker’s compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers’ liability limit equal to the amount required by law.
2. Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee’s operations under this Ordinance.
b. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars (2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.

The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance..
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION.
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Ordinance, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Ordinance shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Ordinance, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Ordinance.

Code of the City of Leawood
afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the either party from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Ordinance, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Ordinance shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal.

Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Ordinance or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Ordinance shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
a.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Ordinance shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

a.

b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:
Code of the City of Leawood
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC).

Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.00 per Access line per month. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back, provided the City provides Grantee with written notice ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.

If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
Code of the City of Leawood

Code of the City of Leawood
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law.

SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
a. The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee’s rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee’s property in good repair.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee.

Code of the City of Leawood
b. The grant of this Contract franchise by the City shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the Public right-of-way, and shall give only the right to occupy the Public right-of-way, for the purposes and for the period stated in this Contract franchise. This Contract franchise does not:
1. Grant the right to use Facilities or any other property, telecommunications related or otherwise, owned or controlled by the City or a third-party, without the consent of such party;
2. Grant the authority to construct, maintain or operate any Facility or related appurtenance on property owned by the City outside of the Public right-of-way, specifically including, but not limited to, parkland property, City Hall property or public works facility property; or
3. Excuse Grantee from obtaining appropriate access or attachment agreements before locating its Facilities on the Facilities owned or controlled by the City or a third-party.
c. As a condition of this grant, Grantee is required to obtain and is responsible for any necessary permit, license, certification, grant, registration or any other authorization required by any appropriate governmental entity, including, but not limited to, the City, the FCC or the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC). Grantee shall also comply with all applicable laws, statutes and/or city regulations (including, but not limited to those relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way or other public property).
d. Grantee shall not provide any additional services for which a franchise is required by the City without first obtaining a separate franchise from the City or amending this Contract franchise, and Grantee shall not knowingly allow the use of its Facilities by any third party in violation of any federal, state or local law. In particular, this Contract franchise does not provide Grantee the right to provide cable service as a cable operator (as defined by 47 U.S.C. § 522 (5)) within the City. Grantee agrees that this franchise does not permit it to operate an open video system without payment of fees permitted by 47 U.S.C. § 573(c)(2)(B) and without complying with FCC regulations promulgated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 573.
e. This authority to occupy the Public right-of-way shall be granted in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and not in conflict with state or federal law.

Code of the City of Leawood
b. Grantee’s use of the Public right-of-way shall always be subject and subordinate to the reasonable public health, safety and welfare requirements and regulations of the City. The City may exercise its home rule powers in its administration and regulation related to the management of the Public right-of-way; provided that any such exercise must be competitively neutral and may not be unreasonable or discriminatory. Grantee shall be subject to all applicable laws and statutes, and/or rules, regulations, policies, resolutions and ordinances adopted by the City, relating to the construction and use of the Public right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the City’s Ordinance for Managing the Use and Occupancy of Public Right-of-way, adopted as Ordinance No.1834C, and amendments thereto.
c. Grantee shall participate in the Kansas One Call utility location program.
SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed the maximum Access line fee allowed by Statute. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back; provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.
a. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.
b. Grantee shall pay on a quarterly basis without requirement for invoice or reminder from the City, and within 45 days of the last day of the quarter for which the payment applies franchise fees due and payable to the City. If any franchise fee, or any portion thereof, is not postmarked or delivered on or before the due date, interest thereon shall accrue from the due date until received, at the applicable statutory interest rate.
c. Upon forty-five (45) days prior written request by the City, but no more than once per quarter, Grantee shall submit to the City a certified statement showing the manner in which the franchise fee was calculated.
d. No acceptance by the City of any franchise fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact the correct amount, nor shall acceptance of any franchise fee payment be construed as a release of any claim of the City. Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
Code of the City of Leawood
e. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.
f. Unless previously paid, within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Ordinance, Grantee shall pay to the City a one-time application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00). The parties agree that such fee reimburses the City for its reasonable, actual and verifiable costs of reviewing and approving this Ordinance.
g. The franchise fee required herein shall be in addition to, not in lieu of, all taxes, charges, assessments, licenses, fees and impositions otherwise applicable that are or may be imposed by the City. The franchise fee is compensation pursuant to K.S.A. 12-2001(j) and shall in no way be deemed a tax of any kind.
h. Grantee shall remit an access line (franchise) fee or a gross receipts (franchise) fee to the City on those access lines that have been resold to another telecommunications local exchange service provider, but in such case the City shall not collect a franchise fee from the reseller service provider and shall not require the reseller service provider to enter a franchise ordinance.
SECTION 5. INDEMNITY AND HOLD HARMLESS.
It shall be the responsibility of Grantee to take adequate measures to protect and defend its Facilities in the Public right-of-way from harm or damage. If Grantee fails to accurately or timely locate Facilities when requested, in accordance with the Kansas Underground Utility Damage Prevention Act, K.S.A. 66-1801 et seq., it has no claim for costs or damages against the City and its authorized contractors unless such parties are responsible for the harm or damage caused by their negligence or intentional conduct. The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee, affiliate or subcontractor of Grantee, or its respective officers, agents, employees, directors or representatives, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.
Code of the City of Leawood
The indemnity provided by this subsection does not apply to any liability resulting from the negligence of the City, its officers, employees, contractors or subcontractors. If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law. This section is solely for the benefit of the City and Grantee and does not create or grant any rights, contractual or otherwise, to any other person or entity.
Grantee or City shall promptly advise the other in writing of any known claim or demand against Grantee or the City related to or arising out of Grantee’s activities in the Public right-of-way.
SECTION 6. INSURANCE REQUIREMENT AND PERFORMANCE BOND
a. During the term of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall obtain and maintain insurance coverage at its sole expense, with financially reputable insurers that are licensed to do business in the state of Kansas.

Grantee shall provide not less than the following insurance:
1. Workers’ compensation as provided for under any worker’s compensation or similar law in the jurisdiction where any work is performed with an employers’ liability limit equal to the amount required by law.
2. Commercial general liability, including coverage for contractual liability and products completed operations liability on an occurrence basis and not a claims made basis, with a limit of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury, personal injury, and property damage liability. The City shall be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising from Grantee’s operations under this Contract franchise.
b. As an alternative to the requirements of subsection (a), Grantee may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that it is self-insured and as such Grantee has the ability to provide coverage in an amount not less than one millions dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and two million dollars ($2,000,000) in aggregate, to protect the City from and against all claims by any person whatsoever for loss or damage from personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occasioned by Grantee, or alleged to so have been caused or occurred.

Grantee shall, as a material condition of this Contract franchise, prior to the commencement of any work and prior to any renewal thereof, deliver to the City a certificate of insurance or evidence of self-insurance, satisfactory in form and content to the City, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and will not be cancelled or materially changed with respect to areas and entities covered without first giving the City thirty (30) days prior written notice.

The required performance bond must be with good and sufficient sureties, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the State of Kansas, and satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance.
SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION.
In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures: Before the City proceeds to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, it shall first serve a written notice upon Grantee, setting forth in detail the neglect or failure complained of, and Grantee shall have sixty (60) days thereafter in which to comply with the conditions and requirements of this Contract franchise. If at the end of such sixty (60) day period the City deems that the conditions have not been complied with, the City shall take action to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise by an affirmative vote of the City Council present at the meeting and voting, setting out the grounds upon which this Contract franchise is to be revoked and terminated; provided, to afford Grantee due process, Grantee shall first be provided reasonable notice of the date, time and location of the City Council’s consideration, and shall have the right to address the City Council regarding such matter. Nothing herein shall prevent the City from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law. Upon any determination by the City Council to revoke and terminate this Contract franchise, Grantee shall have thirty (30) days to appeal such decision to the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas. This Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked and terminated at the end of this thirty (30) day period, unless Grantee has instituted such an appeal. If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court’s final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
a. The City specifically reserves its right and authority as a public entity with responsibilities towards its citizens, to participate to the full extent allowed by law in proceedings concerning Grantee’s rates and services to ensure the rendering of efficient Telecommunications service and any other services at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of Grantee’s property in good repair.

SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

SECTION 4. COMPENSATION TO THE CITY.
a. In consideration of this Contract franchise, Grantee agrees to remit to the City a franchise fee of 5% of Gross Receipts. To determine the franchise fee, Grantee shall calculate the Gross Receipts and multiply such receipts by 5%. Thereafter, subject to subsection (b) hereafter, compensation for each calendar year of the remaining term of this Contract franchise shall continue to be based on a sum equal to 5% of Gross Receipts, unless the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year that it intends to switch to an Access line fee in the following calendar year; provided, such Access line fee shall not exceed $2.00 per Access line per month. In the event the City elects to change its basis of compensation, nothing herein precludes the City from switching its basis of compensation back provided the City notifies Grantee prior to ninety days (90) before the end of the calendar year.
b. Beginning January 1, 2004, and every 36 months thereafter, the City, subject to the public notification procedures set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001 (m), and amendments thereto, may elect to adopt an increased Access line fee or gross receipts fee subject to the provisions and maximum fee limitations contained in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto, or may choose to decline all or any portion of any increase in the Access line fee.
c.

Any dispute concerning the amount due under this Section shall be resolved in the manner set forth in K.S.A. 12-2001, and amendments thereto.
f. The City shall have the right to examine, upon written notice to Grantee no more often than once per calendar year, those records necessary to verify the correctness of the franchise fees paid by Grantee.

The City and its authorized contractors shall be responsible to take reasonable precautionary measures including calling for utility locations and observing marker posts when working near Grantee’s Facilities.
b. Grantee shall indemnify and hold the City and its officers and employees harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, judgments, costs, liens, losses, expenses, fees (including reasonable attorney fees and costs of defense), proceedings, actions, demands, causes of action, liability and suits of any kind and nature, including personal or bodily injury (including death), property damage or other harm for which recovery of damages is sought, to the extent that it is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be caused by the negligence of Grantee, any agent, officer, director, representative, employee or subcontractor of Grantee, while installing, repairing or maintaining Facilities in the Public right-of-way.

SECTION 7. REVOCATION AND TERMINATION.
a. In case of failure on the part of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise, or if Grantee should do or cause to be done any act or thing prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise, Grantee shall forfeit all rights, privileges and franchise granted herein, and all such rights, privileges and franchise hereunder shall cease, terminate and become null and void, and this Contract franchise shall be deemed revoked or terminated, provided that said revocation or termination, shall not take effect until the City has completed the following procedures:

If Grantee does timely institute such an appeal, such revocation and termination shall remain pending and subject to the court’s final judgment. Provided, however, that the failure of Grantee to comply with any of the provisions of this Contract franchise or the doing or causing to be done by Grantee of anything prohibited by or in violation of the terms of this Contract franchise shall not be a ground for the revocation or termination thereof when such act or omission on the part of Grantee is due to any cause or delay beyond the control of Grantee or to bona fide legal proceedings.
b. Nothing herein shall prevent the City or Grantee from invoking any other remedy that may otherwise exist at law.
SECTION 8. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.

Code of the City of Leawood
SECTION 9. FAILURE TO ENFORCE.
The failure of either the City or the Grantee to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this Contract franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver or relinquishment shall be deemed to have been made by the City or the Grantee unless said waiver or relinquishment is in writing and signed by both the City and the Grantee.

If Grantee and the City are found jointly liable by a court of competent jurisdiction, liability shall be apportioned comparatively in accordance with the laws of this state without, however, waiving any governmental immunity available to the City under state law and without waiving any defenses of the parties under state or federal law.

signed by the Mayor and City Clerk approving said amendment.
16-2-2.3 Interpretation of Boundaries
The boundaries of the districts on the official zoning map shall be determined by the legal descriptions
associated with approved zoning applications, or lacking such legal descriptions, on the basis
of the location of the boundary as depicted on the official zoning map. Where uncertainty exists
regarding the boundaries of districts, the following rules shall apply:
A) The district boundary lines are center lines of streets or railroads or such lines extended,
property lines or such lines extended, a line lying in the center of a stream or drainage
way, or the city limits of the City.
B) In the event the exact location of a boundary cannot be determined by the foregoing
methods, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall, upon application, determine the location of
the boundary.

as “permitted” in the applicable district on Table of Uses, Section 16-2-7, all uses of land
and rezoning of property within the City of Leawood shall be subject to the planned zoning procedures
in Article 3. Except as may be exempted in Article 3, all uses of property in any zoning district
on the Zoning Map adopted herewith and for which no development plans have been submitted
and approved, shall require the submittal of preliminary and final development plans for any
new construction, reconstruction and alteration of any building, structure, parking area or other
new or altered activity and shall meet all other requirements of Article 3.
16-2-3.2 Special Uses
In addition to compliance with the Planned Development plan process, all uses designated as requiring
a “Special Use Permit” in the Table of Uses 16-2-7 shall be authorized in the applicable
district only to the extent permitted by a Special Use Permit approved pursuant to 16-4-3. No use
of a building, structure or land that is designated as a Special Use in any zoning district shall hereafter
be established, and no existing Special Use, or part thereof, shall hereafter be expanded or
changed to another Special Use in such district, unless a Special Use Permit has been secured in
accordance with the provisions of Section 16-4-3 of this Ordinance and in addition to compliance
with the Planned Development Procedures in Article 3. Any established use on the effective date
of this Ordinance that would be reclassified as a Special Use in the district in which it is located
has all the rights of an approved Special Use and does not require any additional approval or review.
No Special Use already established on the effective date of this Ordinance shall be altered,
modified, or enlarged unless a new Special Use Permit is issued in conformance with the regulations
applicable to the zoning district in which such use is located.

or use is permitted by and in conformance with the provisions of Section 16-4-1 of this Ordinance,
and all other regulations or requirements pertaining, whether generally or specifically, to the
district in which such building, structure or use is located.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 6
16-2-3.5 Classification of Uses Not Listed
In the case where a use is not authorized on the Table of Uses, Section 16-2-7, as a permitted,
planned or special use in the applicable district, or authorized as an Accessory Use as provided in
Article 4 of this Ordinance, such use shall be prohibited unless the Planning Commission determines
that the proposed use is sufficiently similar to a use expressly authorized in the applicable
district and not otherwise prohibited or intended to be prohibited by this Ordinance or other applicable
regulations and such determination is approved by the Governing Body. Except as provided
in this subsection, uses not listed have been determined either not to be appropriate in any district,
incompatible with certain existing uses, or are sufficiently rare or unexpected as to be incapable of
being listed at the time of adoption of this Ordinance. Any use not shown as an authorized use,
but constituting a use that is required to be permitted by law shall be authorized only in the BPBusiness
Park district subject to the following conditions:
A) The use shall be permitted only to the extent required by law to be permitted;
B) The use shall be approved only as a planned use, except if by law it is required to be permitted
by right;

Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 8
A) Construction of new or additions to existing residential property shall provide a front setback
equal to or greater than the setback provided for in the district regulations.
Where the front setback on the existing structure exceeds the minimum regulation of this
Ordinance, the setbacks set forth in the subsections below shall apply:
1) Single street frontage: Any construction of new or additions to existing residential
buildings located on or along a single street frontage shall provide a front setback
equal to or greater than the average of the front setback provided by the existing
structures on the two adjoining properties. If any one of the structures on
the adjoining lots is situated on a curve or corner, then the calculation set forth
above shall utilize an average setback for such structure, calculated by averaging
the smallest and largest front setbacks provided by the structure.
2) Corner lot - structure facing intersection of two streets: Any construction of
new or additions to existing residential buildings located on a corner lot with the
structure facing the intersection of two streets, shall provide for a front setback
which shall not be less than the setback provided by the existing structures on the
adjoining lots. The setback lines provided by each adjoining lot shall be drawn to
an intersecting point outlining the area allowed for the front setback for such corner
lot.
3) Corner lot - structure facing one street: Any construction of new or additions to
existing residential buildings located on a corner lot with the structure facing one
street, shall provide a front setback equal to or greater than the average measurement
of the two nearest structures on either side of the subject property along
the same street.
If the setback of any structure to be used in the formula set forth above provides a setback,
which is less than the setbacks mandated in the City’s district regulations, then the
setback mandated in the district regulation shall be used in the calculation.
B) Where the rear yard of a home is fully adjacent to a platted outlot owned and maintained
by a Homeowners Association, then the rear yard setback may be encroached upon by 10
feet if:
1) The owner of the home secures written consent by the Homeowners Association
for the encroachment; and
2) The outlot does not contain buildings, swimming pools or structures of any kind.
(Ord. 1998, 7-15-03)

No part of a setback, open space, lot area, off-street parking, or loading space required in connection
with any building, structure or use for the purpose of complying with this Ordinance shall be
used to satisfy any part of such bulk, off-street parking or loading space requirements for any other
building, structure or use.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 9
16-2-4.7 Structures Permitted Above the Height Limits
Subject to the limitations of this Section, the following may exceed the district height limitations
provided they are allowed for a use permitted in the district in which they are erected or
constructed and provided architectural design and appearance have been approved by the
Planning Commission and the Governing Body: chimneys, cooling towers, condensers, elevator
bulkheads, belfries, stacks, steeples, ornamental towers, monuments, cupolas, domes, spires, and
necessary mechanical appurtenances and their protective housing, and provided that a parapet
wall is used to screen such mechanical appurtenances from view. Parapet walls shall not be
calculated in the overall height of the structure they serve. Buildings and structures constructed
for the purpose of public uses, government uses, or public utility facilities, may exceed the height
limitations of the district. However, no portion of any structure may be erected to a height
exceeding 75 feet without approval of the Governing Body incorporated in the conditions of an
approved Development Plan. Unless otherwise provided for in an approved Development Plan,
any increase in the permitted height of any such structure above the height allowed herein or in
such district regulations shall require at least one additional foot of setback space on all sides for
each additional foot by which such building or structure exceeds such height limit, and provided,
further, that to the extent the lot of such building or structure is adjacent to a residential area, an
additional three feet of setback space for each additional foot by which such building or structure
exceeds the height limitation in the district is required between such building and the lot lines of
the adjacent residential neighborhood. Provided, further, in no event shall any such structure
exceed the height of 155 feet, unless otherwise allowed by height limitations in the applicable
district [see e.g., Section 16-3-9(A)(8)].

Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 12
D) Bulk Regulations:
For purposes of this Section of this Ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings
as set forth below:
Average Single-Family Floor Area Ratio – 0.23
Base Lot Area – 15,000 sq. ft.
Base Lot Depth – The base lot depth is calculated by dividing the minimum lot area required
per the bulk regulations below by the minimum lot width required per the bulk regulations
below. In an R-1 district, this calculation is 15,000/100=150.
Garage Allowance - 450 sq.ft.
Lot Depth - The lot depth is the measurement from the front property line to the rear
property line. For non-rectangular lots, lot depth will be calculated by measuring the distance
from the midpoint of the front lot line to both the point on the rear lot line that is closest
and that which is the farthest away. The average of these two measurements will then
be taken to determine the lot depth.
Lot Width -The horizontal distance between the side property lines measured at the required
front yard setback line.
New – A dwelling that is constructed on a lot upon which a dwelling has never existed.
Rebuild – A dwelling that is constructed on a lot upon which a dwelling has previously existed.
Remodel – Any improvement to the exterior or interior of a dwelling that requires a building
permit, including construction that increases the size of a dwelling in terms of height,
length, width or total floor area.
Single Story Dwelling – A dwelling which has no habitable living space above the floor
on which the main entrance is located.
Square Footage – The livable area of a dwelling excluding any basement area.
Two-Story Dwelling – A dwelling wherein there is a habitable living space above the floor
on which the main entrance is located.
Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
Front Setback: 35 feet, unless the setback regulations in Section 16-2-4.5 apply. In
addition, no rebuild shall be permitted to have a front setback greater
than the average of the midpoints (50% of the depth) of the adjacent
homes facing the same street on either side of the subject property.
Midpoints will be calculated by determining the distance from the front
property line to the midpoint of the dwelling along the side directly adjacent
to the subject lot. See Figure B below.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 13
Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to grant
an exception to the required Front Setback for the addition of a nonenclosed
front entryway to an existing structure, after notice and public
hearing as provided for in Section 16-5-3, and upon a determination
that such exception shall not cause adverse impact on surrounding
properties and that the following conditions are met:
a) The existing structure was legally constructed and the structure
meets the required front yard setback; and
b) The proposed entryway addition is no larger than 75 sq. ft., and
protrudes into the required setback by no more than 6 feet; and
c) The proposed entryway addition will be architecturally attached to
and be constructed of the same materials as the primary residence;
and
d) The exception is necessary to allow for the entryway improvement
to be made.
Side Setback: 15 feet; except that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power
to grant an exception to the required Side Setback for additions to existing
structures, after notice and public hearing as provided for in Section
16-5-3, and upon a determination that such exception shall not
cause adverse impact on surrounding properties and that the following
conditions are met:
a) The existing structure was legally constructed with a Side Setback
of less than 15 feet; and
b) In no case shall any proposed addition be any closer than 10 feet
to the property line; and
c) The proposed addition shall not extend beyond the existing side
build line of the existing structure; and
d) The proposed addition shall not cause further encroachment than
that of the existing structure.
Corner Lot Side
Setback:
30 feet
Rear Setback: For lots that have a depth of 150 feet or less, 30 feet. For lots that
have a depth of more than 150 feet, the rear yard setback shall be calculated
using the following formula: 70% x (Lot depth-150) + 30. If the
dwelling has a front setback greater than the front setback required per
these bulk regulation or the requirement contained in Section 16-2-4.5
of this Ordinance, then the rear setback shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the difference between the actual front setback and the required
minimum front setback; provided in no circumstance shall the
rear setback be less than 30 feet.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 14
Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
Irregular Lot Rear
Setbacks:
On lots, with an irregular rear property line, with a primary structure
placed at approximately a 45 degree angle toward the street or lots of
other than generally rectangular shape, the rear yard setback shall
have an average distance of 30 feet. This setback shall be determined
by extending the sidewalls of the structure to the rear property
line and calculating the square footage within the area between the
rear walls, the side extensions and the rear property line(s). This figure
will then be divided by the distance between the extended sidewall
lines. This will give the average depth of the area enclosed and
this must be equal to or greater than 30 feet. In no case shall the
structure be located less than 15 feet from any property line.
Lot Area; existing
lots:
15,000 square feet per dwelling
Lot Area; new lots:* The greater of 15,000 sq. ft. or the average (up to a maximum of 1
acre) of all lot sizes within 300 feet of any lot line. For the purposes of
this calculation, only lots within the municipal boundary of the City of
Leawood shall be included.
Lot Frontage: 100 feet
Minimum Lot
Width:
100 feet as measured at the front setback
Height Limit: 35 feet as measured at grade at the front door, unless one of the restrictions
or exceptions outlined in Subsection E below should apply.
Maximum Square
Footage
The maximum square footage allowed for any single family residential
structure shall be determined by the following formula:
(.23 x Base Lot Area x (Lot Width/Minimum Lot Width) x (Lot
Depth/Base Lot Depth))+Garage Allowance
Open Space 30% of lot area
*Lots created after the effective date of this Ordinance.
E) Restrictions on Height. The maximum height of a dwelling shall be further limited as follows:
1) Additional Restrictions.
a. Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwellings other than those situated between two Two-
Story Dwellings: The maximum height of the exterior wall at the side-yard
setback shall not exceed 23 feet in height as measured from the front door elevation;
provided, that for each additional foot of setback, one additional foot
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 15
of height may be added up to thirty feet. Provided, that the total height of the
dwelling shall not exceed 30 feet as measured at grade at the front door.
b. Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwellings situated between two Two-Story Dwellings:
If the Rebuilt or Remodeled dwelling has two story dwellings on either side,
then the maximum height of the exterior wall adjacent at the side-yard setback
shall not exceed 23 feet in height as measured from the front door elevation;
provided, that for each additional foot of setback, one additional foot of height
may be added, provided, the subject dwelling shall not be greater than the
taller of the two adjacent dwellings. If one of the adjacent dwelling received
an adjustment in height as provided in Subsection F below, then such adjustment
shall be subtracted from the height of the adjacent dwelling for purposes
of determining the allowed height for the subject dwelling.
c. If the Rebuilt or Remodeled dwelling is situated on a corner lot, then the
above guidelines shall apply using the dwellings on the two nearest abutting
lots on either side of the subject dwelling to determine the height limit. See
Figure A below.
2) Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwelling Height Limit Modified. In all cases, however, a rebuilt
or remodeled dwelling may be built to the dimensions of the previous dwelling
existing prior to the demolition or destruction. In addition, an increase in height
may be granted at a rate of 1 foot for every 1 foot in side yard setback provided
above the minimum side yard setback required, up to a maximum of 3 feet.
F) Board of Zoning Appeals Authorized to Grant Exceptions. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall have the power to grant an exception to the above stated height and bulk restrictions
for, rebuilt or remodeled dwellings, after notice and public hearing as provided for in Section
16-5-3, and upon a determination that such exception shall not cause adverse impact
on surrounding properties, and that the following conditions are met:
1) Exception for Height Limit:
a. The additional height allowed shall not be more than 2 feet for a maximum
height of 37 feet for instances where the 35 foot height limit applies and 32
feet for instances where the 30 foot height limit applies; and
b. The dwelling has not already received the height increase allowed in Subsection
E above for additional side yard setback provided; and
c. The grade of the subject lot is such that applying the height limit restrictions
contained in Subsection E above would cause a hardship on the applicant in
light of the proposed design of the applicant’s dwelling and the design of the
neighboring dwellings; and
d. The proposed height of the, rebuilt or remodeled dwelling shall reflect the
character of the other surrounding dwellings in the neighborhood.
2) Exception for Maximum Square Footage:
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 16
a. The additional square footage allowed shall not be more than 20 percent of
the maximum square footage allowed pursuant to this Ordinance; and
b. The proposed size of the rebuilt or remodeled dwelling shall reflect the character
of the other surrounding dwellings in the neighborhood.
G) Grade Change. The natural grade of the lot on which the, rebuilt or remodeled dwelling is
to be placed shall not be vertically altered by more than 1 foot, unless the alteration is to
provide compliance with storm and waste water regulations or guidelines. Provided, such
alteration to the natural grade of the lot of more than 1 foot shall not exceed the most
stringent grading standard that will provide compliance with the City’s storm and waste water
regulations, and any such alteration shall first be approved in writing by the City Engineer.
H) Sewage Disposal: Connection to a sanitary sewer system is required.

of this Ordinance except as may be expressly exempted.
C) Accessory Uses: Accessory Uses in this district are governed by 16-4-1 of this Ordinance.
D) Bulk Regulations:
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 18
For purposes of this Section of this Ordinance, the following terms shall have the meanings
as set forth below:
Average Single-Family Floor Area Ratio – 0.23
Base Lot Area – 12,000 sq. ft.
Base Lot Depth – The base lot depth is calculated by dividing the minimum lot area required
per the bulk regulations below by the minimum lot width required per the bulk regulations
below. In an RP-1 district, this calculation is 12,000/100=120.
Garage Allowance - 450 sq.ft.
Lot Depth - The lot depth is the measurement from the front property line to the rear
property line. For non-rectangular lots, lot depth will be calculated by measuring the distance
from the midpoint of the front lot line to both the point on the rear lot line that is closest
and that which is the farthest away. The average of these two measurements will then
be taken to determine the lot depth.
Lot Width - The horizontal distance between the side property lines measured at the required
front yard setback line.
New – A dwelling that is constructed on a lot upon which a dwelling has never existed.
Rebuild – A dwelling that is constructed on a lot upon which a dwelling has previously existed.
Remodel – Any improvement to the exterior or interior of a dwelling that requires a building
permit, including construction that increases the size of a dwelling in terms of height,
length, width or total floor area.
Single Story Dwelling – A dwelling which has no habitable living space above the floor
on which the main entrance is located.
Square Footage – The livable area of a dwelling excluding any basement area.
Two-Story Dwelling – A dwelling wherein there is a habitable living space above the floor
on which the main entrance is located.
Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
Front Setback: 35 feet, unless the setback regulations in Section 16-2-4.5 apply. In
addition, no rebuild, as defined in Subsection E below, shall be permitted
to have a front setback greater than the average of the midpoints
(50% of the depth) of the adjacent homes facing the same street on
either side of the subject property. Midpoints will be calculated by determining
the distance from the front property line to the midpoint of the
dwelling along the side directly adjacent to the subject lot.
In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to grant
an exception to the required Front Setback for the addition of a nonArticle

Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
enclosed front entryway to an existing structure, after notice and public
hearing as provided for in Section 16-5-3, and upon a determination
that such exception shall not cause adverse impact on surrounding
properties and that the following conditions are met:
a) The existing structure was legally constructed and the structure
meets the required front yard setback; and
b) The proposed entryway addition is no larger than 75 sq. ft., and
protrudes into the required setback by no more than 6 feet; and
c) The proposed entryway addition will be architecturally attached to
and be constructed of the same materials as the primary residence;
and
d) The exception is necessary to allow for the entryway improvement
to be made.
Side Setback: 12 feet
Corner Lot Side
Setback:
30 feet
Rear Setback: For lots that have a depth of 150 feet or less, 30 feet. For lots that
have a depth of more than 150 feet, the rear yard setback shall be calculated
using the following formula: 70% x (Lot depth-150) + 30. If the
dwelling has a front setback greater than the front setback required per
these bulk regulation or the requirement contained in Section 16-2-4.5
of this Ordinance, then the rear setback shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the difference between the actual front setback and the required
minimum front setback; provided in no circumstance shall the
rear setback be less than 30 feet.
Irregular Lot Rear
Setbacks:
On lots, with an irregular rear property line, with a primary structure
placed at approximately a 45 degree angle toward the street or lots of
other than generally rectangular shape, the rear yard setback shall
have an average distance of 30 feet. This setback shall be determined
by extending the sidewalls of the structure to the rear property
line and calculating the square footage within the area between the
rear walls, the side extensions and the rear property line(s). This figure
will then be divided by the distance between the extended sidewall
lines. This will give the average depth of the area enclosed and
this must be equal to or greater than 30 feet. In no case shall the
structure be located less than 15 feet from any property line.
Lot Area; existing
lots:
12,000 square feet per dwelling
Lot Area; new lots:* The greater of 12,000 sq. ft. or the average (up to a maximum of 1
acre) of all lot sizes within 300 feet of any lot line. For the purposes of
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 20
Requirement Minimum Distance/Area
this calculation, only lots within the municipal boundary of the City of
Leawood shall be included.
Lot Frontage: 100 feet
Minimum Lot
Width:
100 feet as measured at the front setback
Height Limit: 35 feet as measured at grade at the front door, unless one of the restrictions
or exceptions outlined in Subsection E below should apply.
Maximum Square
Footage
The maximum square footage allowed for any single family residential
structure shall be determined by the following formula:
(.23 x Base Lot Area x (Lot Width/Minimum Lot Width) x (Lot
Depth/Base Lot Depth))+Garage Allowance
Open Space 30% of lot area
*Lots created after the effective date of this Ordinance.
E) Restrictions on Height. The maximum height of a dwelling shall be further limited as follows:
1) Additional Restrictions.
a. Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwellings other than those situated between two Two-
Story Dwellings: The maximum height of the exterior wall at the side-yard
setback shall not exceed 23 feet in height as measured from the front door elevation;
provided, that for each additional foot of setback, one additional foot
of height may be added up to thirty feet. Provided, that the total height of the
dwelling shall not exceed 30 feet as measured at grade at the front door.
b. Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwellings situated between two Two-Story Dwellings:
If the Rebuilt or Remodeled dwelling has two story dwellings on either side,
then the maximum height of the exterior wall adjacent at the side-yard setback
shall not exceed 23 feet in height as measured from the front door elevation;
provided, that for each additional foot of setback, one additional foot of height
may be added, provided, the subject dwelling shall not be greater than the
taller of the two adjacent dwellings. If one of the adjacent dwelling received
an adjustment in height as provided in Subsection F below, then such adjustment
shall be subtracted from the height of the adjacent dwelling for purposes
of determining the allowed height for the subject dwelling.
c. If the Rebuilt or Remodeled dwelling is situated on a corner lot, then the
above guidelines shall apply using the dwellings on the two nearest abutting
lots on either side of the subject dwelling to determine the height limit. See
Figure A below.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 21
2) Rebuilt or Remodeled Dwelling Height Limit Modified. In all cases, however, a rebuilt
or remodeled dwelling may be built to the dimensions of the previous dwelling
existing prior to the demolition or destruction. In addition, an increase in height
may be granted at a rate of 1 foot for every 1 foot in side yard setback provided
above the minimum side yard setback required, up to a maximum of 3 feet.
F) Board of Zoning Appeals Authorized to Grant Exceptions. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall have the power to grant an exception to the above stated height and bulk restrictions
for, rebuilt or remodeled dwellings, after notice and public hearing as provided for in Section
16-5-3, and upon a determination that such exception shall not cause adverse impact
on surrounding properties, and that the following conditions are met:
1) Exception for Height Limit:
a. The additional height allowed shall not be more than 2 feet for a maximum
height of 37 feet for instances where the 35 foot height limit applies and 32
feet for instances where the 30 foot height limit applies; and
b. The dwelling has not already received the height increase allowed in Subsection
E above for additional side yard setback provided; and
c. The grade of the subject lot is such that applying the height limit restrictions
contained in Subsection E above would cause a hardship on the applicant in
light of the proposed design of the applicant’s dwelling and the design of the
neighboring dwellings; and
d. The proposed height of the, rebuilt or remodeled dwelling shall reflect the
character of the other surrounding dwellings in the neighborhood.
2) Exception for Maximum Square Footage:
a. The additional square footage allowed shall not be more than 20 percent of
the maximum square footage allowed pursuant to this Ordinance; and
b. The proposed size of the rebuilt or remodeled dwelling shall reflect the character
of the other surrounding dwellings in the neighborhood.
G) Grade Change. The natural grade of the lot on which the, rebuilt or remodeled dwelling is
to be placed shall not be vertically altered by more than 1 foot, unless the alteration is to
provide compliance with storm and waste water regulations or guidelines. Provided, such
alteration to the natural grade of the lot of more than 1 foot shall not exceed the most
stringent grading standard that will provide compliance with the City’s storm and waste water
regulations, and any such alteration shall first be approved in writing by the City Engineer.
H) Sewage Disposal: Connection to a sanitary sewer system is required.

16-2-6.4 MXD (Mixed-Use Development District)
A) General Purpose and Description: This section contains the regulations for the planned
Mixed-Use Development District. These regulations are supplemented and qualified by
additional general regulations appearing elsewhere in this Ordinance which are incorporated
as part of this section by reference. Mixed-Use developments shall only be approved
in areas designated as appropriate for mixed uses in the Comprehensive Plan. All
uses authorized by the MXD District shall be subject to the Development Plan process set
forth in Article 3 of this Ordinance.
This section establishes a zoning classification which permits planned developments that
include a mixture of residential, retail, office, and cultural uses in a single structure or
multiple structures and that incorporate a coordinated, consistent theme throughout the
development in its pedestrian and vehicular access and ways consistent with the adopted
135th Street Community Plan, where applicable. It is the purpose of these regulations to
encourage a mixed-use, pedestrian oriented development within unified projects located in
proximity to designated major roadways and intersections. The MXD District allows for
traditional town center marketplace development with nodes and destination streets and
other coordinated pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development by authorizing interrelated
uses and structures with specific additional regulation of design, architecture, lighting,
greenspace and other site requirements appropriate to ensure the location of employment
and retail centers in proximity to higher density housing.
B) Permitted Land Uses and Developments: Permitted land uses and developments shall
be established in the conditions of the Ordinance and resolution governing the particular
Mixed-Use Development District; specific uses may include uses designated as Permitted,
Planned or Special Uses in any of the RP-2, RP-3, RP-4, SD-O, SD-NCR, and SD-CR
Districts. Each Mixed Use Development District shall include a mix of both multi-family
residential and commerical uses, with not less than twenty (20) percent of the total gross
floor area constructed dedicated to residential uses. For the purposes of this calculation
only, an applicant, at its discretion, may count up to 50% of hotel square footage as
residential use; the remaining percentage shall be counted as retail.
C) Accessory Uses: Accessory Uses in this district are governed by 16-4-1 of this Ordinance.

E) Additional Conditions. Additional conditions for establishment of the MXD District shall
be as established by the Development Plan pursuant to Article 3 and as may be
appropriate to ensure the suitability of mixed-uses and the design of the specific location
designated.
F) Floor Area Ratio (FAR) Calculation. The floor area ratio for this district shall be
calculated using the full square footage amount of commercial space (office and retail)
and a 25% discount of the square footage of residential space, divided by the square
footage of the entire site (including any dedicated right of way). A discount of up to a total
of 55% of the square footage of residential space may be recommended by staff and will
be subject to Governing Body approval.
G) Deviations. In addition to the deviations in Section 16-3-9 (A) 4, the following deviations
to the FAR requirement may be granted in this district:
1) Increased Open Space. Projects with permanent open space in excess of the
required minimum and the deviations already allowed may receive up to 15%
increase in the applicable maximum FAR based on not less than a 1:1 ratio of
increased floor area to increased open space. The additional open space must
provide a benefit to the community as habitat area for native flora and fauna,
strom water recharge/ management potential, and /or passive recreational
potential for the public;
2) Cultural Use. Projects which include a minimum 10% of the total square footage
for cultural uses may receive up to 10% increase in the applicable maximum FAR
based on not less than a 1:1 ratio of increased floor area to square footage of
cultural use.

16-2-6.5 BP (Planned Business Park)
A) General Purpose and Description: The Business Park District is intended to provide for
a mixture of land uses of varying types in a single coordinated development. The district
may include mixtures of office, sales, distribution, warehouse, and related service uses.
The district would be a suitable location for many business activities that desire to combine
all of their functions in one location. This district is not intended to be used by general
retail businesses without supporting office and/or distribution services. Services are
allowed which would support other businesses in the park such as copy services and
childcare centers. Assembly or processing which meets strict performance standards is
allowed. Assembly of “high tech” goods such as electronic equipment is encouraged.

16-2-8 SPECIAL DISTRICTS
16-2-8.1 REC (Planned Recreation)
A) General Purpose and Description: The REC District is intended to provide for the development
of certain lands for recreational purposes to serve Leawood residents. In order
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 38
to promote the most compatible uses to adjoining property, this district is narrow in scope
and offers a very limited range of uses.
B) Principal Permitted and Special Uses: In District REC, no building structure, land, or
premises shall be used, and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or altered, except for one or more of the following principal
permitted or special uses:
1) Public golf courses, and accessory driving ranges, subject to Article 3 plan approval,
but excluding pitch and putt and miniature golf courses;

3.
(Ord. 2013, 08-04-03)
16-2-8.2 FL (Flood Hazard Overlay District)
A) Statutory Authorization, Finding of Fact, and Purposes
1) Approval of Draft Ordinance by Kansas Chief Engineer Prior to Adoption. The following
floodplain management regulations, as written, were approved in draft form
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 39
by the chief Engineer of the Division of Water Resources of the Kansas Department
of Agriculture on May 14, 2009.
2) Statutory Authorization: The Legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A. 12-
741 et seq., and specifically in K.S.A. 12-766, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect
the health, safety, and general welfare. Therefore, the Governing Body of the
City of Leawood, Kansas ordains as follows.
B) Findings of Fact:
1) Flood Losses Resulting from Periodic Inundation. The special flood hazard areas
of the City of Leawood, Kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of
life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
2) General Causes of these Flood Losses. These flood losses are caused by (1)
The cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases
in flood heights and velocities, and (2) the occupancy of flood hazard areas
by uses vulnerable to floods, hazardous to others, inadequately elevated, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
3) Methods Used to Analyze Flood Hazards. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) that
is the basis of this Ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing
flood hazards that consists of a series of interrelated steps.
a. Selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations, which
permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence,
the area inundated, and the depth of inundation. The base flood
selected for this Ordinance is representative of large floods, which are characteristic
of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to
this Ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to
have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one year, as delineated
on the Federal Insurance Administrator’s Flood Insurance Study, and illustrative
materials of the most recent date, as amended, and any future revisions
thereto.
b. Calculation of water surface profiles based on a standard hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over-bank areas to
convey the regulatory flood.
c. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing
flood heights more than 1 foot at any point.
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is
permitted which would cause any increase in flood height.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 40
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e., that area outside the floodway encroachment
lines, but still subject to inundation by the base flood.
C) Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section to promote the public health, safety,
and general welfare; to minimize those losses described in Section 16-2-8.2(B)(1); to
establish or maintain the community’s eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) as defined in 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 59.22 (a)(3);
and to meet the requirements of 44CFR 60.3(d) and K.A.R. 5-44-4 by applying the provisions
of this Ordinance to:
1) Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or property in times
of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities.
2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities that serve such
uses, be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction.
3) Protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development
purposes due to the flood hazard.
D) General Provisions. Lands to which Section Applies. This Section shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the City, identified as numbered and unnumbered A Zones, AE,
AO, and AH Zones, on the Index Map dated August 3, 2009 of the Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) as amended, and any future revisions thereto. In all areas covered by this
Ordinance, no development shall be permitted except through the issuance of a floodplain
development permit, granted by the City Council or its duly designated representative under
such safeguards and restriction as the City Council or the designated representative
may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare, health
of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in Section 16-2-8.2(G)
and 16-2-8.2(I).
1) Compliance. No development located within the special flood hazard areas of this
City shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance
with the terms of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations.
2) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this Section to repeal,
abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this Ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this Ordinance
shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this Section are hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
3) Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Section
shall be held to be minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of
the Governing Body, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by Kansas statutes.
4) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by
this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions
or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes,
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 41
such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This Section does not
imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land
uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage.
This Section shall not create liability on the part of the City of Leawood, Kansas,
or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance
on this Section or any administrative decision lawfully made there under.
5) Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this Section is adjudged
unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the remainder of
this Section shall not be affected thereby.
E) Floodplain Development Permit
1) Permit Required. A floodplain development permit shall be required for all proposed
construction or other development, including the placement of manufactured
homes, in the areas described in Section 16-2-8.2(G). No person, firm, corporation,
or unit of government shall initiate any development or substantial improvement
or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate floodplain
development permit for each structure or other development.
2) Administration.
a. The Director of Public Works is hereby appointed to administer and implement
the provisions of this Section.
b. Duties of the Director of Public Works shall include, but not be limited to:
i. Review all applications for floodplain development permits to assure that
sites are reasonably safe from flooding and that the floodplain development
permit requirements of this Section have been satisfied.
ii. Review of all applications for floodplain development permits for proposed
development to assure that all necessary permits have been obtained
from those Federal, State or local governmental agencies from which prior
approval is required by Federal, State, or local law.
iii. Review all subdivision proposals and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether
such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
iv. Issue floodplain development permits for all approved applications.
v. Notify adjacent communities and the Division of Water Resources, Kansas
Department of Agriculture, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
vi. Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion
of any watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 42
vii. Maintain a record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of
the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially improved
structures.
viii. Maintain a record of the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
that the new or substantially improved nonresidential structures have
been flood proofed.
ix. When floodproofing techniques are utilized for a particular nonresidential
structure, the Director of Public Works shall require certification from a
registered professional engineer or architect.
3) Application for Floodplain Development Permit. To obtain a floodplain development
permit, the applicant shall first file an application in writing on a form furnished
for that purpose. Every floodplain development permit application shall:
a. Identify and describe the work to be covered by the floodplain development
permit.
b. Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot, block,
tract, house and street address, or similar description that will readily identify
and specifically locate that proposed structure or work.
c. Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended.
d. Be accompanied by plans and specifications for proposed construction.
e. Be signed by the permittee or his/her authorized agent who may be required
to submit evidence to indicate such authority.
f. Give such other information as reasonably may be required by the Director of
Public Works.
i. Indicate the assessed value of the structure and the fair market value of
the improvement.
ii. Specify whether development is located in designated flood fringe or
floodway.
iii. Identify the existing base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed
development.
F) Establishment of Zoning Districts. The mapped flood plain areas within the jurisdiction of
this Section are hereby divided into the two following districts: A floodway overlay district
(FW) and a floodway fringe overlay district (FF) identified in the Flood Insurance Study
[and accompanying map(s)]. Within these districts, all uses not meeting the standards of
this Section shall be prohibited. These zones shall be consistent with the numbered and
unnumbered A Zones (including AE, AO and AH zones) as identified on the official FIRM
and identified in the Flood Insurance Study provided by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
G) Standards For The Floodway Overlay District And The Floodway Fringe Overlay District
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 43
1) General Standards. The following are general standards for the Floodway Overlay
District and the Floodway Fringe Overlay District:
a. No permit for floodplain development shall be granted for new construction,
substantial improvements and other improvements, including the placement of
manufactured homes, within any numbered and unnumbered A zones (including
AE, AO, and AH zones) unless the conditions of this section are satisfied.
b. All areas identified as unnumbered A zones on the FIRM are subject to inundation
of the 100-year flood; however, the base flood elevation is not provided.
Development within unnumbered A zones is subject to all provision of this
Section. If Flood Insurance Study data are not available, the community shall
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation or floodway data
currently available from Federal, State or other sources. A “100 year flood”
refers to a flood level with a 1 percent greater chance of being equaled or exceeded
in any given year.
c. Until a floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within any unnumbered
or numbered A zones, or AE zones on the FIRM, unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood.
d. All new construction, subdivision proposals, substantial improvements, prefabricated
structures, placement of manufactured homes, and other developments
shall require:
i. Design or adequate anchorage to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
ii. New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters, and onsite
waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid impairment or
contamination.
iii. Construction with materials resistant to flood damage.
iv. Utilization of methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
v. All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment
and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
vi. Subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, located within special flood
hazard areas are required to assure that:
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 44
1. The proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage
2. The public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage,
3. Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood
hazards, and
4. Proposals for development, including proposals for manufactured
home parks and subdivisions, of 5 acres or 50 lots, whichever is lesser,
include within such proposals the base flood elevations data.
e. Storage, Material and Equipment.
i. Storage or processing of materials within the special flood hazard area,
which materials are buoyant in time of flooding, flammable, explosive, or
could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, is prohibited.
ii. Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to
major damage by floods and if firmly anchored to prevent flotation or if
such material or equipment is readily removable from the area within the
time available after flood warning.
2) Specific Standards. In all areas identified as numbered and unnumbered A
zones, AE, and AH Zones, where base flood elevation data have been provided,
as set forth in Section 16-2-8.2(G)(1), the following provisions are required:
a. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of
any residential structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest
floor elevated a minimum of two (2) feet above base flood elevation. The
elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer.
b. Non-Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any commercial, industrial, or other non-residential structures, including
manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, elevated a minimum of two
(2) feet above the base flood elevation or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be dry flood proofed or elevated to at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the FIRM above the highest adjacent natural
grade. In AH Zones, if no depth number is specified on the FIRM, it shall
be dry flood proofed or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent
natural grade. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. The elevation of the lowest
floor shall be certified by a licensed land surveyor or registered professional
engineer. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator
as set forth in Section 16-2-8.2(E)(2)(b)(ix).

c. Other Construction. All new construction and substantial improvements, that
have fully enclosed areas below lowest floor used solely for parking of vehicles,
building access, or storage in an area other than a basement and that
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
i. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than
one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
ii. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings
or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
flood waters.
3) Manufactured Homes
a. Manufactured homes placed within all unnumbered and numbered A zones,
AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM, shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
b. Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within unnumbered
or numbered A zones, AE, and AH zones, on the community's FIRM,
may only be installed as follows:
i. Outside of manufactured home park or subdivision;
ii. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
iii. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
iv. If such home is in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result
of a flood, then such home must be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a
minimum of two (2) feet above the base flood elevation and be securely
attached to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be
certified by a licensed land surveyor or registered professional engineer.
c. Manufactured homes which are placed or substantially improved on sites in
an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within all unnumbered and
numbered A zones, AE and AH zones, on the community's FIRM, and are not
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 46
subject to the provisions of Section 16-2-8.2(G)(6) of this Section, must be elevated
so that either:
i. The lowest floor of the manufactured home is a minimum of two (2) feet
above the base flood level; or
ii. The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than
thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely attached to
an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement. The elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified
by a licensed land surveyor or registered professional engineer.
4) Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH zones). Located within the areas of special
flood hazard as described in Section 16-2-8.2(D) are areas designated as AO
zones. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood
depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist
and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. The following
provisions apply:
a. AO Zones
i. All new construction and substantial-improvements of residential structures,
including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high
as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least
two feet if no depth number is specified).
ii. All new construction and substantial-improvements of any commercial, industrial,
or other non-residential structures, including manufactured
homes, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above
the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified
in feet on the community FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified) or together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities be
completely flood proofed to that so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and effects of buoyancy.
iii. Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes,
in order to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
b. AH Zones
i. The specific standards for all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation has been provided shall be required as set forth in Section
16-2-8.2(G)(5).
ii. Adequate drainage paths shall be required around structures on slopes,
in order to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 47
5) Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 16-
2-8.2 (G)(2) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and
potential projectiles, the following provisions shall apply:
a. The City shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle
that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry
the waters of the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of
that flood more than one foot at any point.
b. The City shall prohibit any encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the City during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
c. If Section 16-2-8.2(I) is satisfied, all new construction and substantialimprovements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of Section 16-2-8.2(G).
d. In unnumbered A zones, the City shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation or floodway data currently available from Federal,
State, or other sources as set forth in Section 16-2-8.2(G)(2).
6) Recreational Vehicles.
a. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within all unnumbered and
numbered A zones, AO, AE, and AH zones on the community's FIRM either:
i. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
ii. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use meaning that the vehicle is on
wheels or a jacking system and is attached to the site only by quickdisconnect
type utilities and security devices and it has no permanently
attached additions; or
iii. Meet the permitting, elevating, and the anchoring requirements for manufactured
homes of this Section.
H) Floodway Overlay District
All new residential lots shall be completely located outside Floodway Overlay Districts.
Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not obstructing flood flows shall be
permitted within the Floodway District to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other
ordinance and are otherwise permitted under the Leawood Development Ordinance.
All uses within the Floodway Overlay District are subject to the development plan procedures
as set forth in Article 3. All encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments must be prohibited unless certification by a
professional Kansas registered engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 48
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge.
No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation.
I) City Flood Hazard Overlay District
1) This section provides for the establishment of a city flood hazard overlay district.
This district will include those areas subject to periodic inundation by 100-year
flood but are not delineated on the most recent maps prepared by the Federal Insurance
Administration.
2) Generally, residential structures in this area shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated at least two feet above the floor hazard elevation. If this entirely
precludes the development of the lot the Director of Public Works shall decide
another form of mitigation.
3) Structures having a use other than residential shall, in general, be held to the
same criteria as otherwise provided in this Ordinance. The enforcement of this
section shall depend upon the determination of the Director of Public Works.
J) Variance Procedures
1) The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by the City of Leawood shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements as set forth
in Article 6.
2) In reviewing such applications, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider all
technical evaluation, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this Ordinance, and:
a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
c. The susceptibility of proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and
the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion
damage, for the proposed use;
g. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and flood
plain management program for that area;
i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 49
j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of
the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the
site; and
k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions
including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer,
gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.
3) Conditions for Approving Variances.
a. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements
to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing items in Section 16-2-8.2(J)(2) having been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of
structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places for the State Inventory
of Historic Places, or local inventory of historic places upon determination,
provide the proposed activity will not preclude the structure’s continued
historic designation.
c. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase
in discharge would result.
d. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
e. Variances shall only be issued upon (a) a showing of good and sufficient
cause, (b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant, and (c) a determination that the granting
of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
f. The City shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a City official
that (a) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below base flood
level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts
as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage and (b) such construction
below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification
shall be maintained with the record of all variance actions as required
by this Section.
K) Nonconforming Use.
1) A structure or the use of a structure or premises which was lawful before the passage
or amendment of the Ordinance but which is not in conformity with the provisions
of this Section may be continued subject to the following conditions:
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 50
a. If such use is discontinued for 12 consecutive months, any future use of the
building premises shall conform to this Ordinance.
2) If any nonconforming use or structure is destroyed by any means, including flood,
it shall not be reconstructed if the cost is more than 50% of the pre-damaged market
value of the structure. This limitation does not include the cost of any alteration
to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety codes
or regulations or the cost of any alteration of a structure listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, a State Inventory of Historic Places, or local inventory
of historic places upon determination.
L) Penalties for Violation
Any person or other entity who violates this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of not less than $10 and not more than $100 for each and every day that
such violation continues, or by imprisonment for 10 days for each and every day such violation
shall continue, but in no case to exceed 3 months of imprisonment, or by both such
fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the Court. However, if the offense be willful, on
conviction thereof, the punishment shall be a fine of not less than $100 or more than $500
for each and every day that such violation shall continue or by imprisonment for 10 days
for each and every day such violation shall continue, but in no case to exceed 3 months of
imprisonment, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the Court.
M) Amendments
The regulations, restrictions, and boundaries set forth in this Section may from time to time
be amended supplemented, changed, or appealed to reflect any and all changes in the
National Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, provided, however, that no such action
may be taken until after a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and
citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Leawood, Kansas.
At least 20 days shall elapse between the date of this publication and the public
hearing. A copy of such amendments will be provided to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency VII office. The regulations of this Section are in compliance with the National

structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, the installation of streets and/or walkways;
nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory

of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes
structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair
work performed. The term does not; however, include either (1) any project for improvement
of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and
which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or (2) any alteration of a
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 56
“historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a "historic structure".
“Variance” is a grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this Ordinance, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Ordinance where specific
enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. Flood insurance requirements remain
in place for any varied use or structure and cannot be varied by the community.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development
without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required
by this Ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation
is provided.
“Water Surface Elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes
and frequencies in the floodplain.

16-2-9 PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
Unless otherwise expressly provided in an approved Development Plan, the following performance
criteria shall be complied with as provided in this Section.
16-2-9.1 All Districts
A) No use shall create noise in excess of that of normal daily traffic measured at the lot lines
of the premises. In no case shall the noise level exceed 60 dB at repeated intervals or for
a sustained length of time, measured at any point along the property line. Hospital Generators
installed on or before January 1, 2003, are exempted from the noise limitation in
this section while testing the generators as required by federal, state or local law, or operating
them under conditions of a loss of standard power, provided that (1) the generators,
in combination with any noise reduction enclosures around them, shall have manufacturer’s
specification indicating that the sound/noise emanating from testing or other operation
of the emergency generator shall be no greater than 70 decibels measured at 25 feet from
the generator and no higher than 6 feet above grade, and (2) provided further however,
that because numerous factors may potentially result in noise from generator operation
exceeding the manufacturer-specified 70 decibel maximum, under no circumstance will
the noise levels from the testing or operation of the generators exceed 75 decibel at 25
feet from the generator and no higher than 6 feet above grade. After the effective date of
this ordinance, any generator not otherwise exempt as set forth above and to be newly located
on property subject to revised preliminary or final plan approval shall not fall under
this exemption and shall comply with all other City ordinances regarding noise levels.
B) Architectural quality of the buildings must be of sufficient similarity on all sides of the structure
such that all sides of the building are “finished.”
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 57
C) All public sidewalks, where required or otherwise provided, shall be a minimum of 5 feet
wide. Sidewalks at store fronts shall be a minimum of 8 feet wide.
D) No use shall create dust, dirt, particulate matter, smoke, noxious odor, radiation, noxious
gases, heat, unscreened glare, vibration or concussion which is perceptible without special
instruments at the lot lines of the premises.
E) The design of all developments, whether residential, commercial or industrial shall be such

bicycle access to facilitate the efficient movement of non-vehicular traffic throughout
the City. Where pedestrian and bikeways exist on adjacent parcels, parcel
development plans shall include connections to such systems. Where such systems
are not present on adjacent parcels, development plans shall initiate them
by providing walks and paths that create potential linkages between two or more
adjacent parcels.
2) Along pedestrian routes, provisions for landscape amenities such as seating, art
installations, fountains, and tree planting for shade and cover, shall be considered.
Required and additional landscape plantings shall provide screens or buffers
at parcel edges allowing non-vehicular movement through such areas, with

16-2-10 ARCHITECTURE/CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
The requirements of this section shall apply to all buildings and structures (including single-family
detached dwellings except where noted), unless otherwise expressly provided in a development
plan. The character of the architecture of Leawood shall be driven by the desire to create quality
buildings of lasting beauty. Precedents of style and quality within the region should be viewed as
positive models for new construction. The use of traditional materials and forms is encouraged. In
all cases, buildings shall strive to be accurate and true to their particular style, (i.e. Italianate,
Article 2 Zoning Districts
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 2 ? Page 63
Spanish Mission, Modern, etc.). These requirements shall be in addition to and in conjunction with
requirements set forth in an approved Development Plan.
16-2-10.1 Building Massing, Scale
A) Each building is to have simple, well-proportioned, volumetric form -- a simple form that is
manipulated for relief. Massing of the buildings shall reflect a continuous mass of the
building envelope. Parapets must read as integral to the mass of the building. No flat vertical
surface projections will be allowed above the building roofline. No colonnades of one
story in height shall be permitted to project beyond the face of buildings. Loggias and
other architectural elements may be created by “carving” into the mass of the building, not
by applied decoration.
B) Building Scale within areas designated for commercial land use shall have the appearance
of two floors minimum on all sides. Generally building scale shall reflect the particular use
housed in the building. Details that provide human scale to structures should be fully considered
and incorporated into the design.
C) Roof forms and pitch shall be consistent for all roofs part of the same building or block of
buildings.
D) Deviation from simple forms shall be allowed to accentuate building entries and significant
corners or points of access. Corners of buildings shall provide significant articulation
through fenestration, material, and detailing.
E) Two towers, projections, or roof accents, (i.e. finials, cupolas etc.) per building shall be
allowed. Any proposed deviation from the guideline shall be reviewed on an individual basis.
F) To maintain a coherent architectural image within the City and to reduce conflict between
facades of adjacent buildings, special attention shall be paid to regulating lines established
by existing buildings. Building heights, cornice lines, sill heights, floor levels, entry
heights are all important references to be respected to reduce visual conflicts between adjacent
buildings.
G) Linear massing will be regulated on public frontage by articulating the facade with architectural
elements. A contiguous building facade (longer than 100 feet) shall have a building
element, such as an entrance, courtyard, arcade, or other element dividing the facade
visually. Buildings shall avoid long monotonous, uninterrupted walls or roof planes.
H) All four sides of a building shall be constructed to the same standard of design and maintain
consistency in architecture.
16-2-10.2 Shading Devices

16-3-1 STATEMENT OF INTENT
The division of the City into zoning districts is based on the principle that similar conditions prevail
throughout a particular district. Development or redevelopment of any given use within these districts has
the potential, if not properly planned, to impact adversely the community with regard to traffic,
incompatibility of uses, property values, utilities or otherwise. It is the intent of this Article to authorize new
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 2
or changed uses of property as well as certain site alterations, as specified herein, if the location and
circumstances are appropriate to the use or change under the standards provided in this Article. It is also
the intent of this Article to increase the flexibility of development design by authorizing deviations to the
standard district regulations subject to the conditions and/or approval of the Governing Body. Any approval
of any development plan shall be deemed to incorporate the provisions of this Ordinance.
16-3-2 DEVELOPMENT PLANS — WHEN REQUIRED
In any zoning district, an approved development plan as provided by this Article shall be required for (A)
any change in zoning district classification, other than to the AG district, or (B) any change in use, or (C)
any construction or alteration of a structure, landscaping, parking, or drive isles on property or other exterior
change in any zoning district except when such change is:
A) Authorized by a previously approved development plan under this Planned Development
Procedure that has not expired by its own terms or as provided for in this Article;
B) Expressly exempted from the development plan requirements by the underlying zoning district;
C) An alteration or construction of one or more single-family dwellings where no subdivision of land is
required, provided a plot plan for the property is submitted and approved;
D) A change only in use that does not require a change in underlying zoning district or special use
permit and does not propose or require the alteration of parking, traffic volume or patterns, exterior
change or construction, or other physical site requirements;
E) An authorized Agricultural use in the AG Agricultural District;
F) Ordinary maintenance which does not change the exterior color, style, design, or material type;
G) Otherwise exempted from development plan requirements by state or federal law;
H) Changes authorized to be administratively approved by the Director of Planning pursuant to
Section 16-3-3.
16-3-3 ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS
The following changes to a site, building or structure may be approved by the Director of Planning and shall
not require approval or amendment of a Development Plan:
A) Change of permanent signage or sign facing if the size, characteristics, and number of signs
remain the same;
B) Change in landscaping (including location, bed material, related species, etc.) if the size and type
of landscaping remain the same or if the number of landscaping specimens is increased;
C) Change in architectural detail if it is consistent with the general intent and requirement of the
Development Plan approval; and
D) Changes in lighting if the changes otherwise satisfy the Development Plan requirements and
applicable provisions of this Ordinance.
The Director of Planning may administratively approve these changes if the proposed change is consistent
with the provisions and intent of an approved Development Plan and other applicable regulations. The
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 3
Director may deny the change, impose conditions necessary to satisfy applicable requirements, or refer the
request to the Planning Commission. If a party is aggrieved by a denial or conditions imposed on an
administrative approval, the change shall be resubmitted pursuant to the Development Plan Procedure
established in this Article.
16-3-4 DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS
A “Development Plan” shall consist of both a preliminary and final development plan approved as provided
in this Article. No construction of a structure or commencement of a use, or change or alteration in a use,
structure or site, requiring a development plan shall be authorized until approval of the final development
plan. Approval of the preliminary development plan shall be considered an act of rezoning subject to the
procedural requirements for rezoning as set forth in Article 5, except as provided herein. A final
development plan is intended only to provide final additional details or minor changes but shall otherwise
conform to the approved preliminary development plan.
The minimum steps required for approval of a Development Plan approval required by this Article are
summarized as follows:
A) Application for preliminary development plan (Section 16-3-5)
B) Notice and public hearing before the Planning Commission (Section 16-5-3)
C) Recommendation on preliminary development plan by the Planning Commission
D) Governing Body enacts ordinance approving or approving with conditions the preliminary
development plan or denies the plan
E) Submission of Final Development Plan to the Planning Commission
F) Approval of Final Development Plan:
1) No changes or minor changes – approval by the Planning Commission and review by the
Governing Body for final approval, conditional approval, or denial in accordance with voting
procedures for preliminary plan approval.
2) Substantial changes – submission of new preliminary development plan and repeat of
development plan process.
G) Once a Preliminary and Final Development Plan has been approved for a development, each lot will be
required to receive preliminary site plan and/or final site plan approval prior to construction.

deposit the estimated costs in advance of proceeding with the study and further processing of the
application.
D) Application deemed not complete. Technical studies may be required before or after an application
has been initially deemed complete. If required after, the application shall be deemed incomplete
until such study is completed and submitted as required.
16-3-7 CONSIDERATION OF PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT
PLANS
A) Procedure. A preliminary development plan shall be approved by ordinance subject to the same
procedures and requirements of initiation, Planning Commission review and recommendation, and
Governing Body approval as set forth in Article 5, for amendments to zoning district boundaries.
B) Criteria for approval. The Planning Commission may recommend and Governing Body may
approve, deny, approve with conditions, or remand, any preliminary development plan. An
approved development plan may permit deviations from the underlying district regulations only as
specified in this Article. A preliminary development plan approved subject to conditions or
restrictions may specify requirements that must be met before an applicant may submit a final
development plan application. In considering any preliminary development plan application, the
Planning Commission and the Governing Body may give consideration to all relevant factors to the
extent they are pertinent to the particular application, including:
1) Satisfaction of the conditions and requirements applicable to the requested planned use,
as set forth in this Article, including but not limited to any conditions imposed relating to the
granting of deviations.
2) The criteria governing the rezoning of the property, as set forth in the standards and
requirements found elsewhere in the development code or in other applicable law.
3) Whether the development is designed, located and proposed to be operated so that the
public health, safety and welfare will be protected.
4) Whether an identified community need exists for the proposed use.
5) Whether the development will impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of the surrounding property, or impair the use, enjoyment, or value of
neighboring properties.
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 7
6) Whether the development incorporates, as approved by the City, adequate ingress and
egress and an internal street network that minimizes traffic congestion.
7) The capability of the site to accommodate the building, parking, and drives with
appropriate open space and safe, easy ingress and egress.
8) The degree of harmony between the architectural quality of the proposed building and the
surrounding neighborhood.
9) The appropriateness of the minimum dimensions and areas of lots and yards set forth in
the applicable zoning district regulations.
10) The incorporation of standards and principles as may be adopted by the City in its
comprehensive plan or adopted regulations into the development.
C) Required finding. Prior to the approval of any planned zoning district or Development Plan, the
Governing Body shall find that such zoning or development plan is in general conformity with the
provisions of the Comprehensive Plan.
D) Development plan as condition of zoning ordinance. If the preliminary development plan
application was submitted with an application to change the zoning district category, any
development plan approved through the hearing process, concurrent with such application, shall be
deemed a condition of the ordinance that amends the zoning district category of the property,
whether or not the change in district classification is approved in the same ordinance as the
preliminary development plan.
E) Duration of validity. The approved preliminary development plan shall specify the duration of its
validity, but in no event shall an approved preliminary development plan be valid for a period longer
than twenty-four (24) months from the date of such approval until approval of a final development
plan. The Governing Body may grant one extension not exceeding twelve (12) months upon
written request. Where the preliminary development plan shows future development phases for
which sufficient detail is not anticipated to be available at the time of final development plan
approval, the Governing Body may approve a final development plan showing such conceptual
phases as future “development,” provided that the information required by the preliminary
development plan is also shown. No building permit shall be issued for any phases approved as
“future development” prior to amendment of the final development plan containing all detail as
required in this Article.
16-3-8 STANDARDS OF DEVELOPMENT
A development plan, and all uses and activities within a planned district, shall comply with the following
standards:
A) District Regulations. Except for express deviations authorized by this Article, development plans
shall comply with and be deemed to incorporate all regulations set forth in or referenced by the
applicable district.
B) Public Land Dedication. Reservation or dedication of land for public parks, playgrounds, school
sites, open spaces and other public areas shall be provided in accordance with the standards and
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 8
requirements set forth in the approved Development Plan, as amended, and in the ordinance
related thereto.
1) Reservation or dedication of land may be required by the City as a condition of development
plan approval, or the developer may voluntarily offer land to the City for reservation or
dedication but may only be accepted by the Governing Body as provided in this Section.
Notwithstanding the above, park impact fees shall be paid prior to issuance of a building
permit for a wholly non-residential development and prior to final plat recording for any
residential development.
2) Any reserved or dedicated lands must be of suitable size, location, dimension, topography
and general character and must have proper and adequate road and/or pedestrian access
for the particular purpose for which such land is intended to be used. Reserved or
dedicated land shall be clearly indicated as such on the preliminary development plan. The
Planning Commission may, at its discretion and in accordance with the Comprehensive
Plan, recommend the granting of compensating density in exchange for all or a portion of
land dedicated pursuant to this provision in order to achieve a balanced project and a fair
and equitable result.
3) In its approval of a development plan that proposes reservation or dedication, the Planning
Commission may recommend such conditions as deemed necessary to ensure that the
purposes and intent of this section are satisfied.
4) The final plan of a tract including reservation or dedication of land shall be consistent with
the approved development plan and shall incorporate all conditions and requirements
imposed by the City.
5) A final plat that has been approved by the Planning Commission and which shows
dedication of land shall be submitted to the Governing Body for acceptance or rejection of
the proposed dedication. No dedications shall be deemed approved without express action
of the Governing Body in the form of a written “Acceptance of Dedication.” Failure of the
Governing Body to execute an Acceptance of Dedication shall be deemed to be a refusal of
the proposed dedication. A final plat that shows a dedication that has not been accepted by
the Governing Body shall not be dated or endorsed by the Planning Commission.
6) If the Governing Body refuses to accept the dedication, the final plat and plan shall be
returned to the applicant for resubmission to the Planning Commission with appropriate
changes to indicate the use of the portion of the property originally proposed to be
dedicated and for reconsideration of the plat and plan as a whole.
C) Development Fees. The development plan shall be deemed to incorporate and impose as a
condition of approval the payment of all development fees, impact fees or other fees or
development dedications required in this Ordinance or by other ordinances or regulations of the
City.
D) Preliminary Development Plan Ordinance Compliance. The final development plan shall comply
with and be subject to all provisions and conditions of the ordinance approving the preliminary
development plan.
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 9
E) Other applicable regulations. The final development plan shall be subject to all other applicable
regulations of the City, whether in this Ordinance or elsewhere, and whether in existence at the
time of the development plan or thereafter, to the full extent permitted by law.
16-3-9 DEVIATIONS
A) In reviewing a preliminary development plan, preliminary plat or final plat, the Planning
Commission may recommend and the Governing Body may approve deviations from the minimum
standards set forth in the applicable district or other applicable provisions, at the request of the
applicant or otherwise, provided that any deviation so approved shall be in keeping with accepted
land planning principles and must be clearly set out in the minutes as well as on exhibits in the
record, in accordance with the limitations in this section. Deviations shall only be approved as may
be authorized in this section.
1) Standards applicable to all deviations. In addition to the specific deviation requirements
set forth below, no deviations shall be granted except when the following requirements are
satisfied:
a. Any negative impacts that may result from the deviation are adequately addressed
through appropriate mitigation or other conditions that benefit the public and fully offset
any such impact;
b. The deviation is not inconsistent with the provisions or intent of the Comprehensive
Plan;
c. The deviation does not violate the general purposes, goals and objectives of this
Ordinance, the regulation subject to deviation, and other applicable regulations.; and
d. The deviation and the resulting development promote the public benefit.
2) Use Regulations. No deviations shall be permitted to allow uses not otherwise permitted in
the zoning district governing the property.
3) Lot area. Deviations from minimum lot or development areas may be granted where
buildings are clustered so long as the overall density of the development does not exceed
applicable floor area ratios for the entire parcel. Any common open space resulting from
the variance of such density standard shall be set aside for the use and benefit of the
occupants of such development or the general public as may be required by the City.
Deviations from the required minimum lot area of 10 acres for commercial developments
may also be granted where the owner/developer makes diligent efforts, as determined by
the Community Development Director, to work with neighboring tract owners on a
development plan to include the neighboring tracts to no avail. A development plan for
less than 10 acres must take into account existing development and development plans for
surrounding properties, including paths of ingress and egress for both pedestrian and
vehicular traffic. Additionally, deviations may be allowed for landlocked parcels of less
than 10 acres, where the surrounding property has already been developed.
4) Floor area ratio. Deviations from the required floor area ratios [“FAR”] may be granted in
conformance with bonus criteria as specified in this subsection. The determination of the
satisfaction of the bonus criteria, and the amount of any bonus to be awarded shall be at
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 10
the sole discretion of the City. The total FAR for any development plan, including all
bonuses, shall not increase to more than .45, unless approved by a 3/4 super-majority vote
of the members of the Governing Body. FAR calculations shall be based on the total gross
building square footage, generally excluding structured parking area, and the total site
square footage. All approved bonus increases are to be added together before being
applied to the base FAR of the district for calculation. Floor area ratio, FAR, bonuses may
be granted as follows:
a. Increased open space. Projects with permanent natural open space ratios in excess
of the required minimum may receive up to 10% increase in the applicable maximum
FAR based on not less than a 1:1 ratio of increased floor area to increased open
space. Such permanent natural open space must provide value to the community by
preserving and providing habitat areas for native flora and fauna, storm water
recharge/ management potential, and/ or passive recreational potential for the public;
b. Superior site planning. Projects with a landscape architectural plan demonstrating
qualities of landscape conditions significantly superior to those required and/or existing
in other developments in the City, provided that the quantity of landscaping is not
reduced, may receive up to 10% increase in the applicable maximum FAR based on a
1:1 ratio of the construction value for allowable floor area to the construction value of
those qualities deemed to be unique to the project and superior to required or existing
landscape developments in the City. Projects with architecturally significant/superior
fountains, sculpture/environmental art, site lighting conditions, extensive planting,
reduction of heat islands, the limited use of potable water for irrigation, and other
aesthetic or decorative features may be considered by the City as demonstrating
significantly superior landscape conditions justifying such a deviation;
c. Architectural significance and Superior Environmental Design. Projects with an
architectural plan demonstrating qualities of building conditions significantly superior to
those required and/ or existing in other developments in the City may receive up to
10% increase in the applicable maximum FAR based on a 1:1 ratio of the construction
value for allowable floor area to the construction value of those qualities deemed to be
unique to the project and superior to required or existing developments in the City.
Projects with architecturally significant and consistent materials, massing,
environmental systems such as solar shading or natural ventilation, loggias or covered
outdoor areas that are part of the building’s use or primary circulation system, refined
details such as window and door systems, the incorporation of innovative wastewater
technologies to reduce municipal water use, the inclusion of energy systems that are
highly efficient or that utilize renewable energy systems, the reduction of waste or the
use of recycled/salvage construction, demolition or land clearing waste, the use of
materials with recycled contents that are manufactured locally or utilize rapidly
renewable materials, the promotion of high indoor air quality and the efficient delivery
of fresh air, the incorporation of materials and systems that reduce VOC emissions,
the maximizing of natural light through design or other demonstrably superior qualities
may be considered by the City as demonstrating conditions that would allow such a
bonus;
d. Pedestrian amenities. Projects with substantial pedestrian plazas and linkages,
Article 3 Planned Development Procedures
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 3? Page 11
including walkway linkages to buildings and off-site public ways, street furniture and
other features designed to encourage pedestrian circulation and usage may receive up
to 10% increase in the applicable maximum FAR based on not less than a 1:1 ratio of
value in added amenities to value in increased floor area;
e. Integrated storm water detention. Projects containing aerated wet basin storm water
management ponds that are designed to be an integral architectural and site design
element and that complements pedestrian uses on the site may receive up to 10%
increase in the applicable maximum FAR based on a .5:1 ratio of additional allowable
floor area to wet basin area; and
f. Parking structures. Projects incorporating above ground parking structures resulting in
significant increases in landscaped open space may receive up to 10% increase in the
applicable maximum FAR based on a 1:1 ratio of additional open space area to
additional allowable floor area. Projects incorporating underground parking resulting in
significant increases in landscaped open space may receive up to 15% increase in the
applicable maximum FAR based on a 1:1 ratio of additional open space area to
additional allowable floor area.
5) Setbacks. Unless provided below, subject to the general requirements for deviations, the

Neighborhood Services Administrator may only grant an exception to the setback or
screening requirements. The Neighborhood Services Administrator may grant such an
exception if it finds that the following elements are present:
a. The screening around the recreational vehicle, including existing vegetation on
adjoining lots, provides a sufficient buffer from the street and from any other

16-4-6 SIGN REGULATIONS
16-4-6.1 Statement of Intent
The Governing Body finds that unregulated proliferation of signs results in visual clutter, which is harmful
to neighborhood aesthetics and property values and may cause traffic hazards. The provisions of these
Sign Regulations are intended to regulate and control all signs in the City of Leawood. It is the intent to
limit visual clutter and reach a level of aesthetic quality by reducing disharmony in signage and to establish
a sign identity and promote traffic safety for Leawood by limiting the size, type, location and materials of
which signs may be constructed. These regulations are enacted to protect the property values in the City
by enhancing the physical appearance of the City and by authorizing the use of signs that are compatible
with their surroundings.
16-4-6.2 Applicability
A sign may be erected, placed, established, created, or maintained in the city only in conformance with the
standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this Ordinance. Signs are permitted only
as provided in Tables 16-4-6.13, 16-4-6.14, and 16-4-6.15, and subject to the further regulations set forth
in this Article and as otherwise provided by law. All other signs are prohibited.
16-4-6.3 Office, Commercial and Industrial Signage in Planned Districts
For purposes of these regulations, the terms shopping center, business park, office park, industrial park or
other grouping of buildings shall mean a project of one or more buildings with two or more tenants that has
been planned as an integrated development or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at
the time that zoning was approved by the City. No permit shall be issued for an individual sign unless and
until Sign Development Standards have been submitted to and approved by the Governing Body after
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
A) Sign Standards: The developer shall prepare a set of sign standards regulating all signage. Such
standards shall run with the land with all leases or sales of portions of the development. The sale,
subdivision or other partition of the site after the zoning approval does not exempt the project or
portions thereof from complying with these regulations. The size, color, materials, styles of
lettering, type of illumination and location shall be set out in such standards. The Final
Development Plan shall include the Sign Development Standards and be approved as part of the
Final Development Plan. These standards may be revised by resubmitting them to the Governing
Body for approval after recommendation by the Planning Commission.
Sign Development Standards for a Planned District shall meet all requirements of this Ordinance
and are subject to the limitations set forth herein and shall maintain the following as conditions of
approval and acceptance:
1) The Development sign standards, once approved, represent a firm commitment by the
developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans.
2) The sign concept is to be planned and developed in a manner that will result in clear,
readable, effective signage.
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 37
3) The developer may be given latitude in using innovative techniques in the development of
sign concepts.
4) No permit shall be issued for an individual sign in a planned district unless and until Sign
Development Standards for the development have been submitted to the Governing Body
for approval after recommendation by the Planning Commission and the sign is otherwise
in conformance with the Standards and with this Ordinance. Provided, however, that
signs that conform with both the City approved Sign Development Standards for the
applicable development and the sign requirements of this Ordinance may be permitted via
a sign permit granted by the Director of Community Development per Section 16-4-6.14
of this Ordinance. In the event any ambiguity exists as to whether a sign conforms to
either the City approved Sign Development Standards for the applicable development or
the sign requirements of this Ordinance, or the Director otherwise denies the request for
permit, then the applicant may apply for sign approval by the Governing Body after
recommendation of the Planning Commission.
B) Deviation From Requirements: Deviations in size, colors, location, number of signs, and
illumination, may be approved by the Governing Body after recommendation by the Planning
Commission if it is deemed that an equal or higher quality of development will be produced. The
City may, in the process of approving sign concepts, approve deviations from the standard
requirements as follows, provided any deviation so approved shall be in keeping with the intent of
this Ordinance, shall be clearly set out in the minutes as well as on exhibits in the record, and
provided that specific reasons justifying deviations are included in the record. The following
deviations may be granted:
1) In commercial districts if private sign standards have been approved as part of the Final
Development Plan, then deviations from this Ordinance and/or from the private sign
standards as listed above may be approved. If the Governing Body approves a deviation
from the private sign standards, then the private sign standards shall be deemed
amended; provided, in all cases, the maximum of all wall and canopy signs shall be 5% of
the total area of the façade, 200 square feet, whichever is less, or as permitted in Table
16-4-6.13.
2) Directory Signs may be permitted that are scaled to pedestrian traffic.
3) One sign for a subtenant may be permitted per primary tenant provided that all of the
following apply:
a. The primary tenant’s gross floor area shall be a minimum of 25,000 sq.ft.
b. The subtenant sign is necessary to identify a subtenant that has a presence within
the tenant space, but does not have a separate entrance into the primary tenant
space.
c. Signage shall be limited to the identification of the subtenant and shall not identify
phone numbers, product, specific services offered or any other information about the
tenant beyond the name and/or logo of the subtenant.
d. The maximum height of the subtenant sign shall be 75% of the maximum letter height
of the primary tenant.

durable material.
16-4-6.5 Permits Required
A) Permits Required. Except as provided by this Ordinance, or by other ordinance or resolution of
the city, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, alter, relocate or convert any sign or
other advertising structure as defined herein, without first obtaining a sign permit from the
Planning and Development Department after payment of the required fee. Furthermore, the
property owner shall maintain in force, at all times, a sign permit for such sign in accordance with
these regulations. No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign
unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this Ordinance in every respect and with
the Sign Development Standards in effect for the property.
1) Applications for sign permits shall be made upon the forms provided by the Planning and
Development Department.
2) One set of plans drawn to scale indicating the sign location on a site plan, sign size,

the proposed sign when placed will comply with the provisions of law, the sign permit shall be
issued.
D) Denial of Application for Sign Permit. If the Director determines that the proposed sign is not in
compliance with all the requirements of this article and with all other laws and ordinances of the

such determination.
16-4-6.6 Exemptions from Permit Requirements
Permits shall not be required for the following:
A) Any sign erected by the City, County, State or Federal government including street markers and
traffic signs.
B) Any sign necessary for public safety erected by utility companies within their respective
easements.
C) Any sign specifically required by the building codes, Leawood Development Ordinance or
Subdivision Regulations of the City of Leawood.
D) Maintenance of signs.
E) Temporary signs. [See Section 16-4-6.15 for regulations pertaining to Temporary signs.].
16-4-6.7 Sign Area Calculations
The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height.
A) Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of single panel sign shall be measured within a
single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of a sign panel, and in no case passing
through or between any adjacent elements of the same; however, such perimeter shall not include
structural elements or supports outside the limits of such sign and not forming an integral part of
the display. The gross area of a sign composed of separate letters, symbols or words attached
directly to an architectural facade shall be measured as the area enclosed by straight lines drawn
closest to copy extremities encompassing individual symbols or words. Sign band area shall be
included in the area calculations.
B) Computation of Area of Multifaced Signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one face shall
be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two
identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point
at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more
than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
C) Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of
the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade
shall be construed to be the existing grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,
mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases which the normal
grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that
the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 40
point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.
D) In the event that a building has a curved wall, the area of the facade, for sign purposes, will be
determined by drawing two lines perpendicular to the facade. This will then be considered as
straight walls, with the area of this facade to be used in determining the size of the allowed
signage.
E) Maximum area. A total of 200 square feet per sign is allowed for all permanent signage except as
allowed on Table 16-4-6.13.
(Ord. 2846, 07-01-2017)
16-4-6.8 Non-Conforming Signs
In the event a sign erected prior to the adoption of this Ordinance does not conform to the provisions and
standards of the ordinance, then such sign(s) shall be modified to conform or be removed according to the
following:
A) Nonconforming signs may only be replaced with conforming signs.
B) Any maintenance, repair or alteration of a nonconforming sign shall not cost more than 50% of the
current value of the sign as of the date of alteration or repair.
C) Any maintenance, repair or alteration in excess of 50% shall require the sign to come into
compliance.

16-4-6.15 Temporary Signs
A) Purpose and Findings.
The Governing Body enacts this Ordinance to establish reasonable, narrowly tailored regulations
for the posting of Temporary signs on public and private property. Temporary Signs left
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 53
completely unregulated, can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard, and a detriment
to property values as an aesthetic nuisance. By implementing these regulations, the City intends
to:
1) Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through temporary signs and
the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
2) Further the objectives of the City’s comprehensive plan;
3) Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
4) Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
5) Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight
caused by signs;
6) Promote economic development; and
7) Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of the temporary sign regulations.
This ordinance is not intended to, and should not be read to include, content based regulations. If
for any reason any portion or part of this Ordinance set out in this Section, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances is declared to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
will not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Section.
B) Regulations.
Temporary signs, as defined in Article 9, may be posted on property in all Zoning Districts of the
City, subject to the following requirements:
1) The total square footage for temporary signs on any lot in any district, in the aggregate,
shall not exceed forty-eight (48) square feet, with no individual sign exceeding sixteen
(16) square feet. The total square footage of a sign is measured to include all of the
visible display area of only one side of the sign and only the area of one side of a doublesided
sign is included in the aggregate calculation.
2) Signs shall not exceed five (5) feet in height measured from the average grade at the
base of the sign.
3) No sign shall obstruct or impair access to a public sidewalk, public or private street or
driveway, traffic control sign, bus stop, fire hydrant, or any other type of street furniture, or
otherwise create a hazard, including a tripping hazard.
4) No sign shall be illuminated or painted with light reflecting paint.
5) A sign shall only be posted with the consent of the property owner or occupant. Signs
posted in the public right of way may only be posted with the permission of the person or
entity that has a duty to maintain such section of the right of way. Provided further, no
temporary sign shall be placed closer than 5 feet to edge of the pavement or curb of the
street.
6) All temporary signs must be maintained in a state of good repair.
C) Removal or Replacement of Temporary Signs:
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 54
1) The person who has posted or directed the posting of the sign is responsible for the
removal or replacement of that sign.
2) If that person does not remove or replace the sign in accordance with these regulations,
then the property owner or occupant of the building or lot where the sign is posted is
responsible for the sign’s removal or replacement.
D) Obscene Materials.
Obscene signs, flags, banners, or any sign of any type are prohibited. “Obscene” is defined as
any material that (1) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards
would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (2) whether the work
depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the
applicable state law; and (3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value.

16-4-8 NONCONFORMITIES IN GENERAL
Within the zoning districts established by this Ordinance or its subsequent amendment, there exist a) lots;
b) structures; c) uses of land; d) uses of structures; e) uses of land and structures in combination; and f)
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 62
characteristics of use, which were lawful before this Ordinance was adopted or amended, but which would
now be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or its subsequent amendment.
Such instances shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconformities.
16-4-8.1 General Statement of Intent
It is the intent of this Ordinance to recognize the legitimate interests of owners of lawful nonconformities by
allowing such lawful nonconformities to continue, subject to the provisions contained herein. At the same
time, it is recognized that lawful nonconformities may substantially and adversely affect the orderly
development, maintenance, use and value of other property in the same zoning district, property that is
itself subject to the regulations and terms of this Ordinance. In order to secure eventual compliance with
the Leawood Comprehensive Plan, and with the standards of this Ordinance, it is therefore necessary to
carefully regulate lawful nonconformities.
To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
the adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been
carried on diligently. “Actual building construction” is hereby defined to include the placement of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.
16-4-8.2 Lawful Nonconformities
A) Lots: Any lot having insufficient area, width or depth for the zoning district in which it is located, or
insufficient frontage on an improved public street or an improved private street of a planned
district, or any combination thereof, shall be considered a lawful nonconforming lot only if:
1) It was lawfully platted and recorded and on file in the office of the Johnson County
Register of Deeds prior to the adoption of this Ordinance; or
2) There has been a building permit issued on that lot.
On any single lawful nonconforming lot within a zoning district which permits single-family
detached residential dwellings, one such dwelling may be constructed by right, provided that
height, lot coverage, and off-street parking requirements of the zoning district within which the
parcel is located are complied with, and all appropriate permits are obtained prior to any
construction activity.
Further, no such lot or portion thereof shall be used or sold in a manner which will increase its
degree of nonconformity.
B) Structures. Structures that were lawfully constructed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, but
which could not be constructed under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, setbacks, location on the lot or other requirements concerning
structures, shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconforming structures. As such, they may
continue to exist so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided that no reconstruction,
enlargement or alteration of said structures shall occur that will increase their nonconformity
except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance. However, any lawful nonconforming structure or
portion thereof may be altered to reduce its nonconformity.
C) Uses.
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 63
1) Uses of Land. Any use of land, which would not be permitted under the terms of this
Ordinance but lawfully existed at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, shall
hereafter be considered a lawful nonconforming use of land. As such, it may be
continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided that no enlargement,
increase or extension of the lawful nonconforming use of land occurs so that a greater
area of land is occupied than was occupied at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance,
and that no additional structures or additions to structures existing at the time of the
adoption of this Ordinance shall be constructed on the same zoning lot. Further, no such
lawful nonconforming use of land shall be moved or relocated in whole or in part to any
other portion of the zoning lot on which it is located than that portion occupied at the time
of the adoption of this Ordinance. If any lawful nonconforming use of land ceases for any
reason for a period of more than 180 consecutive days, any subsequent use of such land
shall conform to the terms of this Ordinance.
2) Uses of Structures. Any use of a structure with a replacement cost of $1,000 or more
which would not be permitted under the terms of this Ordinance but was lawfully existing
at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall hereafter be considered a lawful
nonconforming use of that structure. As such, it may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful and provided that the structure in which the lawful nonconforming use is
located shall not be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, relocated or
structurally altered except in changing the use to a permitted use in the district in which it
is located or as otherwise provided for in this Ordinance. However, a lawful
nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any parts of the structure
in which it is located where said structure or parts thereof were manifestly arranged or
designed for such use at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, but no lawful
nonconforming use of a structure shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
structure. If any lawful nonconforming use of a structure is discontinued for any reason
for a period of 180 days, such structure shall only thereafter be used in conformity with
the terms of this Ordinance.
3) Uses of Land and Structures in Combination. Any use of land in combination with a
structure which would not be permitted under the terms of this Ordinance but was lawfully
existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance shall hereafter be considered a
lawful nonconforming use of land and structure in combination. As such, it may continue
so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided the use complies with the provisions
of Section 16-4-8.2 of this Ordinance.
4) Characteristics of Use. When an otherwise lawful existing use is permitted generally in
any given zoning district but where, due to the adoption of this Ordinance, required offstreet
parking, paving of parking area, landscaping, screening, and similar regulations are
not provided, such deficiencies attributable to the use shall be considered lawful,
nonconforming characteristics of such use. Said deficiencies shall be brought into
conformance when the use or structure is expanded, enlarged or the intensity is
increased, even though the use itself is permitted generally.
16-4-8.3 Reconstruction of Certain Lawful Nonconforming Structures
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 64
Should any lawful nonconforming structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50% of
its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it may only be reconstructed in conformance with the
provisions of this Ordinance and any associated use must also comply with this Ordinance; except that
lawful nonconforming structures that are single-family detached dwellings, duplexes or townhouses of not
more than 2 laterally attached single-family dwellings, or multi-family dwellings/townhouses not exceeding
4 units may be reconstructed to their former condition, dimensions and location on the lot provided that the
destruction was caused by unintentional actions or a natural disaster and such reconstruction does not
increase the degree of nonconformity that existed prior to destruction. Reconstruction of a lawful
nonconformity, where permitted, must commence within 6 months of destruction. In such case where
reconstruction does not commence within this time limit, the nonconformity will be considered abandoned
and such structure shall be reconstructed only as a permitted use.
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to grant exceptions to this provision. Subject to the
terms of this section, the Board may, in advance of destruction, grant an exception to allow the
reconstruction of structures destroyed by 51% or greater of its replacement cost at the time of destruction.
Such exception shall apply only if the subject structure is destroyed by unintentional actions or a natural
disaster. Further, the exception shall only allow the reconstruction to the original footprint and such
reconstruction must be consistent with the current City building codes and any other safety regulations in
place at the time of reconstruction. Prior to granting the exception, the Board must find the following
factors to be present:
1) the nonconforming site improvement is the only nonconforming situation pertaining to the
property;
2) compliance with the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the property is
located is not reasonably possible, provided, however, that financial hardship cannot
constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible;
3) the property can be redeveloped or rebuilt without any significant adverse impact on
surrounding properties or the public health or safety.
In any case, the exception must be requested within 6 months of actual destruction of a structure or the
nonconformity will be considered abandoned and such structure shall be reconstructed only in
conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
If a structure that has been granted an exception is actually destroyed, reconstruction plans must be
approved by the Planning Commission and Governing Body.

The purpose of this Chapter is to provide special design guidelines/standards and development
regulations which regulate the time, place and manner of the operation of adult use facilities in order to
minimize the negative secondary effects associated with such facilities. The specific purposes of this
Chapter are to:

for the exercise of unfettered discretion in reviewing applications for establishing adult uses.
B) Ensure orderly and thorough city review of applications for adult uses.
C) Establish reasonable and uniform regulations that will reduce possible adverse secondary effects
that adult uses may have upon the residents of the city and preserve the integrity of existing
commercial areas of the city and of residential areas which are in close proximity to such
commercial areas.
D) To protect the rights conferred by the United States Constitution to adult uses in a manner that
ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes those
undesirable negative secondary effects that recognized studies have shown to be associated with
the development and operation of adult uses.
E) To allow a process whereby the unusual site development features or operating characteristics of
such uses may be conditioned through an individual review, in order to be compatible with the
surrounding uses of property.

16-4-12 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS AND
ANTENNAE
16-4-12.1 Statement of Intent.
The City of Leawood has many diverse and unique landscapes that perpetuate the identity of its
residential neighborhoods, protection of these valuable resources is paramount. Accordingly, the
Governing Body finds that the unregulated placement and design of wireless communication facilities,
towers and antennae results in visual clutter that adversely affects community aesthetics and damages the
character that Leawood is built around. This ordinance is intended to provide minimum standards that
ensure that the wireless communication needs of residents and businesses are met, while at the same
time protecting the general safety and welfare of the community.
16-4-12.2 Purpose.
A wireless communication facility, tower or antenna may be sited, constructed, designed or maintained in
the City of Leawood provided that it is in conformance with the stated standards, procedures, and other
requirements of this Ordinance.
More specifically, these regulations are necessary to:
A) Provide for suitable location of wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae so as to
mitigate their effect on residential neighborhoods and land uses;
B) Maintain community aesthetics by minimizing the visual effects of wireless communication
facilities, towers and antennae through specific design and siting criteria;
C) Maximize the use of existing towers and alternative tower structures so as to minimize the need
for new tower locations;
D) Encourage co-location among wireless service providers on existing and newly constructed sites
in order to reduce the overall number of towers needed;
E) Promote the use of innovative camouflage and disguise techniques for wireless communication
facilities, towers, and antennae so as to integrate their appearance with the many architectural
and natural themes found throughout the City of Leawood.
16-4-12.3 Special Use Permit Required
A) Special Use Permit Requirement. Unless otherwise provided herein, wireless communication
facilities, towers, and antennae located outside any building, shall be allowed only upon approval
of a special use permit granted by the Governing Body. A wireless communication facility may be
approved by a single special use permit which shall apply to all the components that comprise the
wireless communication facility; provided, that all the individual components that comprise the
wireless communication facility shall be owned by a single ownership. If the individual
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 87
components of a wireless communications facility are owned by separate ownerships, then each
component shall be approved through separate special use permits. Special use permits for
towers and antennae shall be approved by separate special use permits in cases where such
towers and/or antennae are not part of an application for a special use permit for a wireless
communication facility. A special use permit for an individual tower shall apply to the tower and
any associated landscaping and screening structures or materials. A special use permit for an
individual antenna shall apply to the antenna and any associated antenna support structure and
ground equipment.
A special use permit for any wireless communication facility, tower, and/or antenna shall allow the
specified use by the applicant only and shall not run with the land and is not transferable unless
otherwise approved by the Governing Body by stipulation in the special use permit approval.
Provided, that a special use permit for a wireless communication facility shall only be transferable
as approved by the Governing Body by stipulation in the special use permit approval if the
wireless communication facility is transferred in its entirety from one single ownership to another
single ownership. Provided further, transfer of any individual component of a wireless
communication facility that was approved originally by a single special use permit shall be
completed only by approval of a new special use permit for such component. Should the
Governing Body approve a transfer of ownership of a wireless communication facility, tower
and/or antenna by stipulation in the special use permit approval, prior to completing such transfer,
written notice of the change in ownership shall be delivered to the Planning Department no less
than 30 days prior to the effective date of the transfer of ownership. In addition, prior to the
transfer of a special use permit, a new site plan, as described in this Ordinance, shall be
submitted to the Planning Department for the wireless communication facility, tower and/or
antenna being transferred.
A special use permit for wireless communication facilities, towers, and antennae located outside
any building shall only be approved after notification of adjacent and abutting property owners
within 1000 feet of said property parcel. Written notification shall be conducted by certified return
receipt mail to those parcels within 200 feet of said property and via regular mail as a courtesy to
parcels beyond the 200-foot mark. “Said property parcel” shall be defined as the perimeter of any
parcel recognized by the Johnson County Appraiser’s Office and recorded with a real estate
identification number established for the parcel by Johnson County. As determined and evaluated
by the Plan Commission and Governing Body, wireless communication facilities, towers and
antennae may occupy a smaller leased area on the property parcel, provided that adequate space
is afforded for all facilities, landscaping, berming, and screening, and provided that proper notice
is provided from the perimeter of the property parcel and not the smaller leased area.
All wireless communication facilities and public service antennae located on City properties for
City use, Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), and WIFI systems are exempt from the special use
permit requirement, but shall follow requirements as listed in this ordinance, except as exempted
in Subsection (N) below. All wireless communication facilities, towers, and antennae shall be
exempt from the preliminary and final development plan requirements contained in Section 16-4-
3.3 of this Ordinance.
The following factors shall be considered prior to issuance of the special use permit:
1) Suitable location in accordance with the zoning districts and comprehensive plan;

Ordinance until the expiration of their applicable special use permit.
Upon application, such pre-existing wireless communication facilities, towers and antennae may
receive an extension of expiration of their permit, not to exceed 2 years, with the option of an
additional extension not to exceed one year, as recommended by the Planning Commission and
approved by the Governing Body, in order to bring the facilities into compliance or remove the
facilities. Any approval of such extension shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in
the Special Use Permit authorizing the approval.

(Ord. 2654, 03-17-14)
C) Routine maintenance shall be permitted on a non-conforming structure. Any replacement of a
pre-existing antenna on a non-conforming structure shall be permitted. Any placement of an
additional antenna on a non-conforming structure shall be considered an expansion of the Nonconforming
structure, subject to the conditions of the special use permit. Any such replacement
antenna or additional antenna placed on a non-conforming structure shall require an appropriate
application, and shall meet any and all current applicable design and technical standards and
requirements for new antennae. The cumulative effect of any additional antennae and related
facilities placed upon a non-conforming structure must comply with the radio frequency radiation

no event extend above the height of the tower; and
ii. Color: Antennas are painted to match the color scheme of the tower;
c. Cabling to the antennas is concealed within the tower;
Article 4 Supplemental
Provisions
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 4? Page 90
d. All required landscaping is provided.
G) Design Requirements.
1) Tower Design.
a. Design. All towers will be constructed of a monopole design. Guy and lattice-type
towers will not be allowed. Towers that are less than 75 feet in height must be
designed so that their antennae are internally placed, thus creating a smooth, nonprojecting
appearance. Antenna bridges and platforms are not allowed.
b. Color and Finish. Exterior finish of the monopole will provide for a non-segmented,
tapered appearance. Towers and related facilities shall be designed, camouflaged,
and colored so that their appearance blends with the surrounding natural and built
environment.
2) Antenna Design.
a. Design on Towers. All antennae installed on towers shall be internal or shall be panel
antennae of “slim-line” design and shall be mounted parallel with the tower. Antenna
bridges and platforms are not allowed. Public service omni-directional antennae
operated by the City of Leawood are exempt from this requirement.
b. Design on Alternative Tower Structures. All antennae and related facilities installed
on an alternative tower structure shall be of materials that are consistent with the
surrounding elements so as to blend architecturally with said structure and to
camouflage their appearance. Antennae on the rooftop or above a structure shall be
screened, constructed and/or colored to match the structure to which they are
attached. Antennae exceeding 12 inches in diameter on a roof or building-mounted
facility shall not exceed the height of the structure to which they are attached, unless
fully enclosed.
c. Color and Finish. Antennae and related facilities shall be of materials and color that
are consistent with the tower or alternative tower structure and surrounding elements
so as to blend architecturally with said tower or structure. The antennae and related
facilities shall be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the
color of the tower or alternative tower structure so as to make the antennae and
related facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible. Antennae mounted on the side
of a building or structure shall be painted to match the color of the building or
structure or the background against which they are most commonly seen.
3) Site Plan and Photo Simulations Required. Any application for construction of a new
wireless communication facility, tower or antenna must provide a detailed site plan of the
proposed project. This properly scaled site plan will include one page (including ground

16-8-5 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
16-8-5.1 General Provisions
All subdivisions shall contain the public improvements required for the highest practical level of
safety and welfare of the residents of the subdivision. Such improvements must be of high quality,
designed for the longest practical life and be capable of low cost maintenance. The subdivider
shall, therefore, install at its cost all improvements and they shall comply with the specifications
and standards of the City as set forth in this Ordinance or in other City Codes.
Such improvements shall be installed and as-built plans submitted to the Public Works Department
prior to proper recording of the final plat by the City. No building permit shall be issued for a
building to be placed on a lot that is not fully served by all of these improvements. For purposes of
this Ordinance "being fully served" shall mean that the sanitary sewers (except where alternate
methods are used), water supply, street pavement, sidewalks/bikeways, storm sewers, street
lighting, street markers and monuments shall be installed, duly inspected and found acceptable,
accepted by the City Council, and service connections, if appropriate, applied for.
16-8-5.2 Minimum Required Improvements
The following shall be the minimum required improvements in a subdivision.
A) Streets
1) Where a local or collector street abuts a subdivision, the subdivider shall make
arrangements to pay at least fifty (50) percent of the cost to develop the street to
City standards and shall dedicate one half of the required right of way. Where a
designated arterial street abuts the property owner's land, the property owner shall
make satisfactory arrangements to pay at least fifty (50) percent of the cost to
develop said street to the standards prescribed for a major collector and shall
dedicate one half of the right of way needed for an arterial street. When a
designated arterial street runs completely through the property owner’s land, the
owner shall be required to construct said street to the standards prescribed in the
City Code of the City of Leawood and dedicate the required right-of-way. In cases,
however, where unusual ownership patterns, abnormal street or road conditions,
location of the subdivision on unimproved roadways and other circumstances
make this procedure unworkable, inequitable or contrary to the public interest, the
City may impose additional or alternative conditions for achieving acceptable
improvements.
2) Street name markers conforming to city standards shall be installed on all
intersections.
B) Storm Drainage Facilities
1) Storm water handling facilities shall be designed and installed throughout the
subdivision by the subdivider. All storm water facilities shall be designed by a
professional engineer registered in the State of Kansas and the preliminary plans
Article 8 Subdivisions and Lot Splits
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 8? Page 15
shall be approved by the City Engineer and so certified to the Planning
Commission prior to approval of the final plat.
C) Sidewalks
1) Pedestrian ways shall be separated from roadways used for vehicular traffic.
Sidewalks and/or bikeways shall be required and shall be designed to provide all
residential building sites with direct access to all neighborhood facilities, including
elementary schools, parks, playgrounds, churches, and shopping centers.
2) A sidewalk shall be constructed along one side of all local streets and both sides
of all collector and arterial streets and streets in multifamily and commercial areas.
3) Paved bikeways may be substituted for or provided in addition to sidewalks where
such a facility would benefit the public or comply with the Hike/Bike Trail Plan of
the Comprehensive Plan.
D) Water
1) Water lines shall be installed by the subdivider in keeping with policies and
specification of the water district serving the subdivision.
2) Fire hydrants shall be installed as part of the water main construction to the
standards of the Leawood Fire Department.
E) Sanitary Sewers
1) Sanitary sewers shall be installed by the subdivider in keeping with local and State
standards. Where no system of mains or treatment is available, the City may deny
the subdivision or require special engineering documentation supporting an
alternative sewage disposal system.
F) Street Lighting
1) Street lighting standards and fixtures shall be provided in accordance with the City
requirements.
2) Tree planting and other landscaping shall be regulated to prevent interference with
street lighting or safe sight distance at any intersection or driveway.
G) Monuments
1) Monuments in the form of iron pins not less than one-half inch in diameter and 24
inches in length shall be driven to one inch below the final grade at each block
corner. Corners of the subdivision shall be marked with steel pin not less than
three-fourths inch in diameter and three feet in length, driven to one inch below
final grade. The City Engineer may require additional monuments where the
public interest will be served.
16-8-5.3 Maintenance Surety
In the event that building permits are desired before all of the improvements are in place, the
subdivider may place with the City of Leawood a performance surety and agreement, in the form of
a letter of credit, cash or other like security approved at the sole discretion of the Governing Body,
Article 8 Subdivisions and Lot Splits
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 8? Page 16
guaranteeing the installation of all improvements, whereupon building permits may be issued. The
amount of the surety shall be fixed by the Governing body in an amount not less than 100% of the
estimated cost of all improvements as determined by the City Engineer and shall be conditioned
upon the actual completion of such work or improvements within a specified period, in accordance
with such regulations, which may be enforced by the City by all lawful remedies. In no event shall
an occupancy permit be granted until all such improvements are completed to the satisfaction of
the Director of Public Works.
Such surety and the issuance of building permits may be in increments as may be deemed
practical by the City Engineer but in no case less than one full block length of the street.
The subdivider or the contractors responsible for the construction of public street pavement, curbs
and gutters, storm sewers, sidewalks, bikeways, street markers and street lighting shall deposit
surety in the form of bond or cash with the City guaranteeing against failure of any of those public
works elements for a period of two years following acceptance by the City. The amount of surety
shall be determined by the City Engineer and shall be generally equal to the cost of construction.
In the case of performance surety being as set out above, that surety may be retained by the City
for two years following acceptance of the public works elements in satisfaction of this maintenance
bond requirement. Release of maintenance surety shall be by action of the City Council after
written report from the City Engineer stating that all the improvements are in satisfactory condition.
16-8-6 EXCEPTIONS AND ADMINISTRATION
16-8-6.1 Rule Exceptions
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such an unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such
development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in these
subdivision regulations would result in substantial hardship or inequity, the City may vary from said
requirements of design, but not of procedure or improvements, so that the subdivider may develop
the property in a reasonable manner. At the same time, however, there must be a finding of
unusual hardship as opposed to the mere granting of privileges so that the public welfare and
interest of the City is protected and general intent and spirit of this Ordinance preserved. Such a
rule exception shall state the reason for each variation and may be passed by a three-fourths (3/4)
vote of the regular membership of the Planning Commission subject to review and action, including
approval, denial or conditional approval, by a majority of the membership of the Governing Body.
16-8-6.2 Validity
If any section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these regulations shall be held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such a holding shall not affect any other
section, clause, paragraph, provision or portion of these regulations.
16-8-6.3 Conflict with Private Covenants
The standards and procedures set out herein shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion and protection of health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public. These
Article 8 Subdivisions and Lot Splits
Leawood Development Ordinance Article 8? Page 17
regulations shall not annul or abrogate any covenant, restriction or private agreement; however
when these regulations impose a higher standard than such covenant, restriction or private
agreement, then these regulations shall prevail.
