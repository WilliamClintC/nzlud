COLTON MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances 
of the City of Colton, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 8, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
> 
PREFACE 
The Colton, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1974, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the Ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of the City Attorney. 
The code is organized by subject Matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number Designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine Vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses Following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an Ordinance disposition table, Following the text of the code, listing by number all Ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 8, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. O-01-19, passed February 5, 2019 .

HOW TO Use YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the Laws of the City as accessible as possible to City officials, City Employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation Uses a unique and versatile numbering Structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each Part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which Ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which May contain Ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later Use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one Ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing Material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive Ordinance Material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "Ordinance history note," which lists the underlying Ordinances for that section. The Ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and Year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a secondary Ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent Ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume Preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code User to those portions of the State statutes that are applicable to the Laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help Users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 8, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific Ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very Useful table tells you the status of every Ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by Ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the Ordinance. If the Ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the Ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the Ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes Used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 8, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for Use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each Ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the Ordinance number, adoption date, description of the Ordinance and the disposition within the code of each Ordinance. By Use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent Ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which Uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code User the date of the most recent supplement and the last Ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that Must be pulled from the code and the new pages that Must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 8, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later Use.

3.  Use of the land, or portion thereof, is in compliance with all applicable laws and adopted plans. 
B.  The City Shall not reimburse the owner for costs related to financing any land donation. 
C.  An owner Shall only be entitled to reimbursement to the extent that any land donation benefits property not within the owner's project. Thus, an owner May receive a Mitigation Fee credit as provided in this chapter for property that serves the owner's project and reimbursement for the additional land donation that benefits subsequently developed property. 
D.  In no event Shall an owner receive a Mitigation Fee credit and/or reimbursement in excess of the City's most recent estimated cost of acquiring the land. 
E.  Any reimbursement agreement entered into under this section Shall require the City, for a period of up to fifteen years, to reimburse the owner from the proceeds of the Mitigation Fees collected from new projects that directly benefit from the land donated that is the subject of the reimbursement agreement.

(Ord. No. O-07-15, § 2, 6-2-2015)  
3.46.110 - Deferrals, Waivers and Reductions. 
The City Council is empowered to grant deferral, waiver or reduction of any fee imposed by this chapter upon request. Such deferral, waiver or reduction May only be granted if, in the opinion of the City Council, properly supported by specific findings and evidence, that deferral, waiver or reduction would allow a fairer financing arrangement to be imposed, or where waiver or reduction is required because imposition of such Mitigation Fees in full would cause inequities because prior mitigation lands have been donated. Findings must be based on written and other evidence submitted by the property owner substantiating the owner's contention that the fee should be deferred, waived or reduced. 
Findings must include facts supporting deferral, waiver or reduction including, without limitation, findings that in the case of deferral (1) other properties to be benefitted by any fee will not be burdened by the review and delay in fee imposition, and (2) alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have been proposed for review and will be approved prior to the payment of the fees in question, and (3) delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement; and, in the case of waiver or reduction the owner will receive insufficient or no benefit from the fee imposed and would therefore be required, if the fee were imposed in full, to pay more than their fair share for the benefit received. 
(Ord. No. O-07-15, § 2, 6-2-2015)  
3.46.120 - Exemptions.

A Person who owns, leases, occupies or otherwise maintains within the City a place or Premises upon which or from which he engages in the Business of selling Goods, wares, and merchandise, and whose Gross Receipts from such Sales are attributable to Business activities carried on within the City and activities carried on outside the City, May apportion such Gross Receipts and include in the measure of tax those Gross Receipts directly attributable to activities carried on within the City. 
B.  In making a calculation of Gross Receipts to be reported as the measure of tax, the Person May deduct from one hundred percent of Gross Receipts the percentage of Gross Receipts deemed to be directly attributable to selling activities carried on by such Person outside the City. 
For the purposes of this calculation, the Person May deduct, to the extent appropriate, but in no case in an amount greater than, the Following percentages of those Sales, or particular categories of Sales, on which the corresponding elements of the selling process are performed at a place or location outside the City: 
1.  A Person May deduct one hundred percent of Gross Receipts deemed to be directly attributable to selling activities carried on by such Person outside the City if the Person has in place a similar Business License or Permit in the location outside the City and is accounting for those Gross Receipts at that location. 
2.  A Person May deduct up to twenty percent of Gross Receipts deemed to be attributable to selling activities carried on by such Person outside the City if the Person does not have in place a similar Business License or Permit in that location and is not accounting for those Gross Receipts at that location.

Such Application Shall be made in writing to the Collector and Shall be accompanied by a statement of facts supporting the basis for such modification. The Collector Shall make his determination on the basis of evidence presented to him, and such other evidence as he May have, May request from the taxpayer, or May discover from other sources.

C.

D.  Any variation from the percentages provided for under this ruling Shall be Approved in writing by the Collector.

A.

Such Uses also subject neighboring Residents to excessive Noise and traffic, particularly when the Property or Facility is small or the Use is intense. As such, the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that Special Events are conducted so as not to violate any other Ordinance or regulation of the City or cause any detrimental effects to surrounding Properties and the community. The provisions set forth in this chapter Shall establish criteria for characterizing events as "Special Events" and standards and conditions for approving and Permitting such Special Events.

They can also interfere with the proper collection of data concerning the diversion of waste within the City from landfills. The purpose of these regulations is to promote the health, safety, and/or welfare of the public, and protect the property rights of the owners of the parcels on which the UDCBs are located, by providing minimum blight-related performance standards for the operation of UDCBs, including establishing criteria to ensure that (1) material is not allowed to accumulate outside of the UDCBs, (2) UDCBs remain free of graffiti and blight, (3) UDCBs are maintained in sanitary conditions, (4) the UDCBs are not placed without the approval of property owners, (5) contact information is readily available so that the operators can be contacted if there are any blight-related questions or concerns, and (6) that operators properly report information concerning the diversion of materials from landfills. This section regulates the size, number, placement, installation and maintenance of UDCBs, as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing purposes.

6.16.290 - Commercial organic waste recycling program. 
A.  Purpose. In October of 2014 Governor Brown signed AB 1826 Chesboro (Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), which requires businesses to recycle their organic waste on and after April 1, 2016, depending on the amount of waste they generate per week. Organic waste means food waste, green waste, landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food waste. This law phases in the mandatory recycling of commercial organics over time, with the minimum threshold of organic waste generation by businesses decreasing over time. This chapter establishes the City of Colton Commercial Organic Waste Recycling Program. 
B.  Application. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all businesses as defined in the mandatory organics recycling law, which defines a business as a commercial or public entity (such as a school or hospital) including multifamily residential dwellings (five units or more), that generates a specified amount of organic waste within the city limits (multifamily dwellings are not required to have a food waste diversion program). A business that meets the waste generation threshold shall engage in one of the following organic recycling activities: 
1.  Source separate organic waste from other waste and participate in a waste recycling service provided through the City's waste hauler that includes collection and recycling of organic waste. 
2.  Recycle its organic waste on site, or self-haul its organic waste off site for recycling. 
3.  Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically recycles organic waste. 
Businesses may be required to show proof of compliance. 
C.  Implementation Schedule. The implementation schedule is as follows: 
1.  Businesses that generate four cubic yards of organic waste per week shall arrange for organic waste recycling services. 
2.  January 1, 2019: Businesses that generate four cubic yards or more of commercial solid waste per week shall arrange for organic waste recycling services. 
3.  Summer/Fall 2021: If CalRecycle determines that the statewide disposal of organic waste in 2020 has not been reduced by fifty percent of the level of disposal during 2014, the organic recycling requirements on businesses will expand to cover businesses that generate two cubic yards or more of commercial solid waste per week. Additionally certain exemptions may no longer be available if this target is not met. 
D.  Exemptions. On a case-by-case basis, individual businesses may be exempt from the organic waste recycling requirements. Exemptions may include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Lack of sufficient space in multifamily complexes or businesses to provide additional organic material recycling bins. 
2.  The current implementation by a business of actions that result in the recycling of a significant portion of its organic waste. 
3.  Limited-term exemptions for extraordinary and unforeseen events. 
E.  Enforcement. It will be the responsibility of the waste hauler to implement and enforce this program as provided in the current agreement between the City and the waste hauler. At the time this chapter was adopted Republic Services, Inc. (Contractor) was the waste hauler. Under the current agreement, it is stated that: 
"Contractor shall provide Commercial Organic Waste Collection services for Commercial Customers in the City generating eight cubic yards or more of Organic Waste per week. Contractor shall provide appropriate containers to Commercial Customers and provide weekly collection for such Commercial Organic Waste containers. Contractor will deliver the Collected Organic Waste to a Composting or Processing Facility approved by the City for composting, anaerobic digestion, use as animal feedstock or other means of diversion accepted by CalRecycle, depending on the reasonable availability of a Composting or Processing Facility and as permitted by Applicable Law." 
Collection of all associated fees shall be subject to all provisions under the current franchise agreement with the waste hauler, and as outlined in the most recently adopted Waste Hauler Fee schedule. 
F.  Incompatible provisions. To the extent any provision of this chapter is incompatible with or at variance with any prior adopted ordinance or resolution, the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence, and all prior ordinances and resolutions shall be interpreted to harmonize with and not change the provisions of this chapter. 
G.  Severability. If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or the application of same to any person or set of circumstances is held to be unconstitutional, void, or invalid, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter which shall remain in full force and effect, and all provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable for that purpose.

Chapter 8.16 - REGISTRATION AND MAINTENANCE OF VACANT AND ABANDONED COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY 
 
8.16.010 - Purpose. 
Vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods, especially when the owner of the building fails to actively maintain and manage the building to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood. Vacant buildings (whether or not those buildings are boarded), substandard, or unkempt buildings, and long-term vacancies discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values. Vacant buildings are potential fire hazards and can jeopardize the ability of owners of neighboring property from securing or maintaining affordable fire insurance. It is the responsibility of property ownership to prevent owned property from becoming a burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare. One vacant building which is not actively and well maintained and managed can be the core and cause of spreading blight. It is the purpose and intent of the city council, through the adoption of this chapter, to define the responsibilities of owners of, and to establish registration and monitoring programs for, vacant commercial, and/or industrial buildings and properties.

(Ord. No. O-16-16, § 3, 9-6-2016)  
8.16.070 - Monitoring program and purpose. 
A.  Vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in residential and nonresidential neighborhoods, especially when the owner of the building fails to maintain and manage the building to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood. Vacant buildings often attract transients and criminals, including drug users. Use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals, who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods, creates a risk of fire for the vacant buildings and adjacent properties. Vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for junk and debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass. Vacant buildings which are boarded up to prevent entry by transients and other long-term vacancies discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values. 
B.  Because of the potential economic and public health, welfare and safety problems caused by vacant buildings, the city needs to monitor vacant buildings, so that they do not become attractive nuisances, are not used by trespassers, are properly maintained both inside and out, and do not become a blighting influence in the neighborhood. City departments involved in such monitoring include the police department, development services department, and the public works department. There is a substantial cost to the city for monitoring vacant buildings (whether or not those buildings are boarded up), which should be borne by the owners of the vacant buildings. The fees for a monitoring program pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be separate from and in addition to any registration fees or administrative penalties required or otherwise assessed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. O-16-16, § 3, 9-6-2016)  
8.16.080 - Monitoring program procedures. 
A.  Authority. The chief building official shall be responsible for administering a program for identifying and monitoring the maintenance of all vacant buildings in the city. The program shall be documented and regularly updated. The program shall be available for public review. 
B.  Purposes. The purposes of the monitoring program shall be: 
1.  To identify buildings that become vacant; 
2.  To order vacant buildings that are open and accessible to be secured against unlawful entry pursuant to City codes, including the building code, or other applicable law; 
3.  To initiate proceedings against the owner of any vacant building found to be substandard as defined in this chapter or a nuisance under any other provision of this code; 
4.  To maintain surveillance over vacant buildings so that timely enforcement proceedings are commenced in the event a building becomes substandard or a nuisance; and 
5.  To establish and enforce rules and regulations for the implementation and compliance with the provisions of this Chapter. 
C.  Fee Imposed. There is imposed upon every owner of a vacant building monitored pursuant to this chapter, an annual vacant building monitoring fee in an initial amount as the city council may establish by resolution, provided that the fee shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of monitoring the vacant building. The fee shall be payable as to any building, residential or nonresidential, which: 
1.  Is boarded up by voluntary action of the owner or as the result of enforcement activities by the city; or 
2.  Is vacant for more than ninety days for any reason. 
D.  Fee Deferral. The vacant building monitoring fee may be deferred upon a showing by the owner that: 
1.  The owner has obtained a building permit and is progressing diligently to repair the premises for occupancy; and 
2.  The building meets all applicable codes and is actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; and 
3.  Imposition of the fee is paid prior to final inspection and/or close of escrow of a pending sale. 
E.  Procedure. The vacant building monitoring fee shall be billed to the owner of the property and mailed to the owner's address as set forth on the last equalized assessment roll of the San Bernardino County assessor. Any owner billed may apply for a waiver on the grounds set forth in subsection d of this section by submitting a written statement of the grounds for the waiver, and the owner's daytime telephone number, to the chief building official within thirty days after the billing is mailed to the owner. The owner shall provide substantial evidence in support of the owner's statement of the grounds for the waiver. The chief building official shall review the written statement and all related evidence and may contact the owner to discuss the application for waiver. The chief building official shall prepare a written decision which shall be mailed to the owner and shall set forth the reasons for the decision. 
F.  Any owner aggrieved by the decision of the chief building official relating to an application for waiver may appeal the chief building official's decision to the city manager by filing with the city clerk a written notice of appeal within ten days of the decision. The city manager shall set a time and place for a hearing of such appeal, and notice of such hearing shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the owner at his or her last known address at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing. The decision and order of the city manager on such appeal shall be final and conclusive. 
G.  If the fee is not paid within sixty days after billing, or within sixty days after the decision of the chief building official or the city manager, the city manager may thereupon order that the fee be specially assessed against the property involved. If the city manager orders that the fee be specially assessed against the property, it shall confirm the assessment and thereafter said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property taxes are applicable to the special assessment. 
H.  The city manager may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, a description of the real property subject to the lien, and the amount of the fee.

Chapter 9.23 - PSYCHOACTIVE HERBAL INCENSE, PSYCHOACTIVE BATH SALTS AND OTHER SYNTHETIC DRUGS 
 
9.23.010 - Purpose and intent. 
Recreational use of psychoactive herbal incense, psychoactive bath salts and similar products known as "synthetic drugs" has been documented to cause hallucinations, agitation, psychosis, aggression, suicidal and homicidal ideations, cannibalism and death. While state and federal laws and regulations prohibit some synthetic drugs, the makers of these drugs continually alter the composition of the compounds in their products so as to escape the purview of these laws and regulations. 
It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to prohibit the sale or possession of psychoactive herbal incense and psychoactive bath salts, as those terms are defined herein, in the City in order to protect and preserve the public peace, safety, health, and welfare of those within the City and to provide the City with reasonable measures to address the dangers to the community posed by synthetic drugs, including those not regulated by state or federal law. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to cease or limit or encroach in any way upon any field of law occupied by federal law or by the laws of the state of California. 
The prohibition of psychoactive herbal incense and psychoactive bath salts is necessary and in the interests of the public health, safety and general welfare because there is the substantial likelihood of the sale and use of these illegal drugs in the City of Colton. The sale and use of psychoactive herbal incense and psychoactive bath salts in the City would result in undesirable impacts to the community. Among these impacts are: increased potential for the sale of these controlled substances to minors and adults for their use, increased dependency on these controlled substances, increased harm to the users of these controlled substances, and increased risk of injury to persons or property by users of these controlled substances.

Chapter 9.27 - GRAFFITI* 
 
9.27.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The City Council finds and determines that the writing, spraying, scratching, etching or otherwise affixing Graffiti or other inscribed Materials on public or privately owned real or Personal Property without the consent or Permission of the Owner is injurious to the public health, safety and welfare, for the Following reasons: 
A.  Graffiti Markings are often placed on real or Personal Property, or Structures or Components thereof, by gangs to indicate illicit control over certain locations or areas for purposes of criminal activity. 
B.  Graffiti Markings directly and indirectly encourage gang warfare, including drive-by shootings, and other Acts of violence that result in injuries and fatalities to gang members and innocent by-standers. 
C.  Graffiti Markings are destructive to public and Private Property and cause depreciation of Property values and depreciation in the value of adjacent and surrounding Properties. 
D.  Graffiti Markings result in blight and deterioration of Property and Business values in the community and lead to economic loss. 
The City Council also finds it necessary to enlist Property Owners to actively engage in immediately removing Graffiti and preventing its spread. In the past, the City has provided unlimited, free Graffiti removal services. While this is a valuable service to Property Owners, the City Council recognizes that such actions do not encourage Property Owners to deal directly with the problem of Graffiti and formulate their own ideas, solutions and defense strategies to prevent its spread. In addition, as a result of the City's limited financial resources and resulting reductions in available staff and crews directly assigned to Graffiti removal, the City Council finds that it Must develop alternative approaches to prevent the spread of Graffiti in the City of Colton. 
Therefore, the purposes of this chapter are: (1) to prohibit the defacement of public and Private Property with Graffiti and declare Graffiti to be a Public Nuisance; (2) prohibit the possession of Graffiti Implements by Minors; and (3) provide for the removal of Graffiti and the recovery of costs incurred by the City in such removal. By enacting the provisions contained herein, the City Council seeks to diminish the negative and undesirable impact of Graffiti and promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Colton.

VII. - OFFENSES BY OR AGAINST MINORS  
Chapter 9.32 - JUVENILE CURFEW AND DAYTIME LOITERING* 
 
9.32.010 - Juvenile curfew regulations. 
A.  Purpose. The City is concerned with the level of Juvenile violence, Juvenile gang Activity, and Juvenile crime in the City. The City finds that Juveniles are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful and gang-related Activities and to be victims of older perpetrators of crime. Recent Local statistics regarding Juvenile crime and victimization indicate that enforcement of a curfew for Juveniles decreases Juvenile victimization and increases the number of arrests for violent crimes during curfew hours. The City Council believes that having an enforceable Juvenile curfew Ordinance is critical to preserving the public health, safety and welfare. 
The City further finds and determines that Juveniles are repeatedly detained and supervised by Law enforcement personnel for violating curfew and that Daytime loitering Laws impose an extraordinary burden on the manpower and resources of the Law enforcement services division because Juveniles taken into custody by Law enforcement personnel Must be supervised in an unsecured area of the Law enforcement station until they are released to a Parent or guardian. Law enforcement personnel who supervise Juveniles who have been detained are then unavailable to carry out Law enforcement duties in the Field which decreases the level of Police protection thereby decreasing public safety in the community. One purpose of this section is to inhibit crime committed by Juveniles at Night and by truants during the Day and to defray the reasonable costs that the City incurs to provide extraordinary Law enforcement services to respond to, detain and supervise repeat curfew and Daytime loitering violators.

The Alternative Procedure May be utilized where Improvements have been constructed prior to the formation of the Area of Benefit to collect Fees to reimburse a Developer or the City pursuant to Section 12.32.110. 
B.  Initiation of Proceedings. In lieu of the procedure otherwise provided in this chapter, the Developer, Planning Commission or City Council, on its own motion, May initiate proceedings for the formation of an Area of Benefit, the adjustment of the boundaries in an Area of Benefit, or annexations to an Area of Benefit by adopting a Resolution stating its intention to do so.

6.  The time and place at which the City Council will hold a hearing to consider the formation or adjustment of the Area of Benefit. 
D.  Notice of Hearing. Notice of the hearing Shall be provided at least ten Days before the date set for the hearing by: 
1.  Mailing copies of the Resolution of Intention to the Owners of Real Property located within the proposed Area of Benefit and within three hundred feet of the boundaries of such area at the address as shown on the last equalized assessment roll or as otherwise known to the City Clerk; 
2.  Publication of the Resolution of Intention in a newspaper of general circulation; 
3.  Posting the Resolution of Intention in at least three Public Places within the City, including at least in one Public Place in the proposed Area of Benefit; and 
4.  Mailing the Resolution of Intention to each Local agency expected to provide essential services or facilities within the proposed Area of Benefit whose ability to provide such services or facilities May be significantly affected. 
E.  Protest. At any time not later than the hour set for the Public Hearing, any Owner of Property within the proposed Area of Benefit May file a Written protest against the Improvement Project proposed to be undertaken or against the extent of the Area of Benefit or against the charges proposed to be levied within the Area of Benefit or against any or all of the foregoing. Such protest Must be in writing, Must contain a description of the Property in which the signer is interested sufficient to identify the same, and Shall be delivered to the City CLERK prior to the close of the Public Hearing. A protest May be withdrawn prior to the close of the Public Hearing. 
F.  Hearing. At the time and place established by the resolution of Intention, the City Council Shall hear and consider all protests. The hearing May be continued from time to time. If within the time the protests May be filed, there is filed to the City Clerk a Written protest by the Owners of more than one-half of the area of the Property proposed to be included within the Area of Benefit, and if sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented to less than said one-half, then the proposed proceedings Shall be Abandoned unless the protests are overruled by an affirmative vote of four-fifths of the members of the City Council. The City Council Shall not overrule a majority of protests unless it Shall find that the public health, safety or general welfare require the installation of the Improvements. 
G.  Resolution of Formation. At the conclusion of the hearing and provided that there are no protests by the Owners of over one-half of the land included in the Area of Benefit, the City Council May adopt a Resolution ordering the formation or adjustment of the Area of Benefit. Said Resolution Shall cover those Matters listed in subsection C of this section. Notice of the adoption of the Resolution of formation or adjustment Shall be provided in the same manner as set forth herein for Resolutions of Intention. A certified Copy of the Resolution May be recorded in the Office of the County Recorder. 
H.  Payment of Fees. After the adoption by the City Council of a Resolution forming or adjusting an Area of Benefit, no Development Shall be Permitted on any land included within the Area of Benefit unless or until the proportional share of the Fees established by the Resolution of formation or adjustment for such lands have been paid or provision has been made for such payment to the satisfaction of the City Manager. In addition, whenever the City determines that the Improvement is needed, the City Shall serve a Notice of assessment on the Owners of Properties within the Area of Benefit in the same manner as delivery of the hearing Notices pursuant to subsection D of this section, and Shall record such Notice in the Office of the County Recorder. The amount of the levy shown in the Notice Shall be a lien against the Properties, and the City May foreclose the lien if it is not paid in the same manner as for abatement of Nuisances pursuant to Chapter 6.20. Money received by the City as payment of such Fees Shall be deposited in a special fund established for the Area of Benefit and Shall thereafter be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the Improvement or to reimburse the City for the cost of constructing any Improvement. 
I.  Annual Review. The City Council May annually after the adoption of the Resolution of formation cause an adjustment to be made in the Fees established by said Resolution. Adjustments May reflect: changes in the estimated cost of the proposed public Improvements, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index or such other indices as the City Council May deem appropriate; changes in the Improvements proposed to be constructed; changes in the boundaries of the Area of Benefit; the availability, or lack thereof, of other funds with which to construct the public Improvements; or other factors. However, in no case Shall a modification, the effect of which would be to increase the Fee payable, be made applicable to the lands for which the Fees established by the Resolution formation have already been paid. 
J.  Termination of Area of Benefit. Upon receipt of an Application by a landOwner or Developer, or on its own motion, City Council May initiate proceedings for the termination of an Area of Benefit by adopting a Resolution stating its intention to do so. The Resolution of Intention Shall state the time and place at which the City Council will hold a hearing to consider such termination. If, at the conclusion of such hearing, the City Council finds and determines that the public Improvement for which the area was originally formed will not be required in the reasonably foreseeable future, or that the installation of said public Improvement May be financed more effectively by another method, the City Council May adopt a Resolution declaring the Area of Benefit to be terminated. Upon the termination of the Area of Benefit, the money May remain in the special fund established in connection therewith and Shall be returned to those Persons who had made payment thereof, in proportion to the amount of their payments.

The ordinance from which this chapter derives allows the City to comply with all applicable State and Federal laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and amendments thereto and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403). 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
A.  To prevent the introduction of Pollutants into the Wastewater system which may interfere with the operation of the system, including but not limited to blockages caused by solids or Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) or Pollutants that contaminate the resulting sludge; 
B.  To prevent the introduction of Pollutants into the Wastewater system which may Pass Through the system, inadequately treated, into surface waters, groundwaters, the atmosphere, or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
C.  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim Wastewaters and sludges from the system; and 
D.  To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the Wastewater system. 
E.  To clearly define responsibilities of the City and the User regarding operation and maintenance of the Public Sewer system and private sewer laterals. 
This chapter Shall apply to all Users of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works ("POTW"). This chapter provides for regulation through issuance of Permits to certain non-domestic Users and enforcement of general requirements for the other Users. This chapter also authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities, requires User reporting, establishes administrative review procedures, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs for sewer service.

Chapter 13.30 - WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE ORDINANCE[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. O-12-15, adopted Jan. 16, 2016, amended Ch. 13.30 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 13.30, §§ 13.30.01013.30.250, and Ch. 13.30, App. A, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. O-08-14, § 1(490494), (App. A), adopted Aug. 5, 2014. 
Note Appendices referenced herein are on file and available for review in the offices of the city. 
 
13.30.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The State Legislature has found: 
1.  That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands; 
2.  That the continuation of California's economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses; 
3.  That it is the policy of the State to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource; 
4.  That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development; 
5.  That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient; 
6.  That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use. 
B.  Consistent with the legislative findings, the purpose of this model ordinance is to: 
1.  Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water; 
2.  Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible; 
3.  Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes; 
4.  Use water efficiently without waste by setting a Maximum Applied Water Allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount; 
5.  Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies; 
6.  Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and 
7.  Encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the Model Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance or its local landscape ordinance. 
C.  Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California's environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of the Ordinance, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by: 
1.  Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and esthetic benefits. 
2.  Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas. 
3.  Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment. 
4.  Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion. 
5.  Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action.

r.  Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to hardscapes or in high traffic areas of turfgrass. 
s.  Check valves or anti-drain valves are required on all sprinkler heads where low point drainage could occur. 
t.  Areas less than ten feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff or overspray. 
u.  Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if: 
i.  The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or 
ii.  The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or 
iii.  The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in Section 13.30.110.A.1.(i). Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the irrigation audit. 
v.  Slopes greater than twenty-five percent shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with an application rate exceeding three-quarter inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the Landscape Documentation Package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur.

A.  All Manufactured Homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 1) outside of a Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision, 2) in a New Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision, 3) in an Expansion to an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision, or 4) in an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision on a site upon which a Manufactured Home has incurred "Substantial Damage" as the result of a Flood, Shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the Lowest Floor of the Manufactured Home is elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All Manufactured Homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (A) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest Floor of the Manufactured Home is at or above the Base Flood Elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured Home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above Grade. 
Upon the completion of the Structure, the Elevation of the Lowest Floor including Basement Shall be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community Building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification Shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
(Ord. No. O-04-15, § 15, 4-7-2015)  
15.22.210 - Standards for Recreational Vehicles. 
A.  All Recreational Vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AR, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive Days, and be fully licensed and ready for Highway Use. A Recreational Vehicle is ready for Highway Use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is Attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently Attached additions, or 
2.  Meet the Permit requirements of Sections 15.22.130 through 15.22.160 of this chapter and the Elevation and anchoring requirements for Manufactured Homes in Section 15.22.200(A). 
(Ord. No. O-04-15, § 15, 4-7-2015)  
15.22.220 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special Flood hazard established in Section 15.22.070 are areas Designated as Floodways. Since the Floodway is an extremely Hazardous area due to the velocity of Flood Waters, which carry debris, potential Projectiles, and erosion potential, the Following provisions apply. 
A.  Prohibit Encroachments, including fill, New Construction, Substantial Improvement, and other new Development unless certification by a Registered Professional Engineer is provided demonstrating that Encroachments Shall not result in any increase in (the base) Flood Elevation during the occurrence of the Base Flood Discharge. 
B.  If Section 15.22.220(A) is satisfied, all New Construction, Substantial Improvement, and other proposed new Development Shall comply with all other applicable Flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.22.170 through 15.22.220. 
(Ord. No. O-04-15, § 15, 4-7-2015)  
15.22.230 - Nature of Variances. 
The Variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning Law that Variances pertain to a piece of Property and are not personal in nature. A Variance May be granted for a Parcel of Property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional Hardship to the Applicant or the surrounding Property Owners. The characteristics Must be unique to the Property and not be shared by adjacent Parcels. The unique characteristic Must pertain to the land itself, not to the Structure, its inhabitants, or the Property Owners. 
It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from Flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a Structure built below Flood level are so serious that Variances from the Flood Elevation or from other requirements in the Flood Ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing Flood loss and damage can only be met if Variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the Variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that Must be met before a Variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a Variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. O-04-15, § 15, 4-7-2015)  
15.22.240 - Appeal Board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for Variances, the City Council Shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that Materials May be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and Property due to Flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed Facility and its contents to Flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual Owner and future Owners of the Property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed Facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the Facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed Use which are not subject to Flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed Use with existing and anticipated Development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed Use to the comprehensive plan and Floodplain Management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of Access to the Property in time of Flood for ordinary and Emergency Vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the Flood Waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after Flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, Gas, electrical, and water system, and Streets and bridges. 
B.  Any Applicant to whom a Variance is granted Shall be given Written Notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a Variance to construct a Structure below the Base Flood level will result in increased premium rates for Flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the Base Flood level increases risks to life and Property. It is recommended that a Copy of the Notice Shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and Shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected Parcel of land. 
C.  The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all Variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such Variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. O-04-15, § 15, 4-7-2015)  
15.22.250 - Conditions for Ordinances. 
A.  Generally, Variances May be issued for New Construction, Substantial Improvement, and other proposed new Development to be erected on a Lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by Lots with existing Structures constructed below the Base Flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.22.130 through 15.22.220 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the Lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the Variance increases. 
B.  Variances May be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "Historic Structures" (as defined in 15.22.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the Structure's continued Designation as an Historic Structure and the Variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the Structure. 
C.  Variances Shall not be issued within any mapped Regulatory Floodway if any increase in Flood levels during the Base Flood Discharge would result. 
D.  Variances Shall only be issued upon a determination that the Variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the Flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of Variances to an Elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant Permission for the Applicant to build at Grade, or even to whatever Elevation the Applicant proposes, but only to that Elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the Local Ordinance. 
E.  Variances Shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the Variance would result in exceptional "Hardship" (as defined in 15.22.050 of this chapter) to the Applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a Variance will not result in increased Flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a Nuisance (as defined in Section 15.22.050, see "Public safety or Nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.22.050) of the public, or conflict with existing Local Laws or Ordinances. 
F.  Variances May be issued for New Construction, Substantial Improvement, and other proposed new Development necessary for the conduct of a Functionally Dependent Use provided that the provisions of Section 15.22.250(A) through (E) are satisfied and that the Structure or other Development is protected by methods that minimize Flood damages during the Base Flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a Public Nuisance. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.22.240(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council May Attach such conditions to the granting of Variances as deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter."

(Ord. No. O-01-18, § 1, 2-6-2018)  
15.40.020 - Purpose and intent. 
The City finds, determines and declares: 
A.  That the State Legislature of California, pursuant to Government Code Sections 37361 and 25373, has recognized the value of identifying, protecting, and preserving places, Buildings, Structures, and other objects of historical, aesthetic, and cultural importance and has empowered cities to adopt regulations and incentives for the protection, enhancement, perpetuation, and Use of such places, Buildings, Structures, and other objects; 
B.  That the City possesses many distinctive places, Buildings, Structures, and neighborhoods, beautiful trees, gardens and Streetscapes, public Parks, scenic areas, and urban design features (all referred to in this chapter as "resources") that enhance its value as an attractive and delightful community in which to live and work; 
C.  That certain of these resources are of cultural, aesthetic or historical significance and value because of age, architectural style, aesthetic Appeal, or association with Local history; 
D.  That encouraging the preservation of these resources contributes to the livability and beauty of the community, stimulates economic revitalization, improves Property values in the City, fosters architectural creativity, increases neighborhood stability and conservation, fosters public appreciation of and civic pride in the beauty of the City and the accomplishments of its past, reinforces the distinctive character of the community, adds to the community's understanding of its history and connection with the life and values of the past, and ensures that Colton's cultural, historical, and architectural heritage will be imparted to future generations; 
E.  That shifts in population and in the economy, changes in the way people live, and changes in land Use patterns that threaten to destroy these irreplaceable and desirable resources. Construction and Alterations of inferior quality and appearance are also a threat to these resources; 
F.  That the adoption of reasonable and fair regulations is necessary as a means of recognition, documentation, preservation, and maintenance of resources of cultural, aesthetic, or historical significance. Such regulations serve to integrate the preservation of resources and the extraction of relevant data from such resources into public and private land management and Development processes, and to identify as early as possible and resolve conflicts between the preservation of Cultural Resources and alternative land Uses. Finally, this chapter is intended to carry out the goals and policies of the Colton General Plan.

(Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.00, 1989)  
15.48.020 - Statement of purpose. 
A.  Mobilehome Owners have a substantial investment in a residence for which space is Rented or leased. Alternate sites for relocation of Mobilehomes are difficult to find due to the shortage of Vacant spaces, the restrictions of age, size, or style of Mobilehomes Permitted in many Parks, and related to the installation of Mobilehomes, including Permits, Landscaping and site preparation. Additionally, the cost of moving a Mobilehome is substantial and the risk of damage in moving is significant. 
The result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market of Mobilehome Owners and Tenants. This immobility, in turn, contributes to the creation of a great imbalance in the bargaining relationship between Park Owners and Mobilehome Park Tenants in favor of the Park Owners. 
B.  Because Mobilehomes are often occupied by senior citizens, Persons on fixed income and Persons of low or moderate income, exorbitant Rent Increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness. 
C.  While this chapter is designed to protect Mobilehome Owners from unreasonable Rent Increases, it recognizes the need of Mobilehome Park Owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their investment and Permits Rental increases sufficient to cover the increased cost of repairs, taxes, maintenance, insurance, upkeep and additional amenities.

(Ord. 0-11-91 § 5 (part), 1991: Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C) (1), 1989)  
15.48.250 - Fair return. 
It is the intent of this chapter to allow special Rent adjustments that will provide Park Owners with a fair return on their investments consistent with the expressed goal and purpose of this chapter to protect Tenants from unreasonable increases in Rent. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 5 (part), 1991: Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C), 1989)  
15.48.260 - Definitions.

B.  "Gross Income" equals the Following: 
1.  Gross Rents, computed as gross Rental income; plus 
2.  Interest from Rental deposits, unless directly paid by the Owner to the Tenants (interest Shall be computed at the rate of five and one-half percent per annum of all deposits unless such deposits earn greater interests); plus 
3.  Income from utilities, miscellaneous Fees, and all other Fees charged Tenant; plus 
4.  All other income or consideration received or receivable for or in connection with the Use or Occupancy of Mobilehome Spaces within the Park; 
5.  Minus uncollected Rents due to Vacancy and bad debts to the extent that the same are beyond the Owner's control. Uncollected Rents in excess of three percent of gross Rents Shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise. Where uncollected Rents Must be estimated, the average of the Preceding three Years experience Shall be Used, or some other equitable formula developed. 
C.  "Operating Expenses" include the Following: 
1.  Real Property taxes; 
2.  Utility costs; 
3.  Management expenses (contracted or Owner performed) including necessary and reasonable advertising, accounting, insurance, managerial expenses, and Allowable Legal Expenses. Management expenses are presumed to be five percent of Gross Income, unless established otherwise; 
4.  Repair and maintenance expenses include painting, cleaning, fumigation, Landscaping, and repair of all standard services, including power, electrical, plumbing and carpentry; 
5.  Owner-performed labor which Shall be compensated at the Following hourly rates upon documentation being provided, showing the date, time and nature of the work performed: 
General maintenance 	$ 7.00/hr. 
Skilled labor 	$ 13.00/hr. 
 
Notwithstanding the above, an Owner May receive greater or lesser compensation for self-labor if it can be shown that the amounts set forth above are substantially unfair in a given case. There Shall be a maximum allowance under this Subdivision of five percent of Gross Income, unless the Owner shows greater services for the benefit of the Tenants; 
6.  License or registration Fees required by Law to the extent same are not otherwise paid by Tenants, except registration Fees required under Section 15.48.170; 
7.  Capital expenses with a total cost of less than one hundred dollars per Year per benefited Rental space and the amortized portion of other capital expense; 
8.  Reserve fund for replacement of long term items, not to exceed five percent of Gross Income and only provided that same actually exists; 
9.  Necessary Capital Improvement costs exceeding reserves for replacement. An Owner May include such costs if the Owner has consulted with Tenants prior to initiating construction of such Improvements, regarding the nature and purpose of such Improvements and the estimated costs, and has obtained the prior Written consent of Tenants of at least fifty-one percent of the occupied Mobilehome Spaces that the cost of such Improvements May be included as an operating expense. 
D.  Operating Expenses Shall not include: 
1.  Avoidable and unnecessary expense increases since the Base Year; 
2.  Mortgage principal and interest payments or lease payments under any ground lease except insofar as such payments are contemplated by Section 15.48.330;

7.  Registration Fees required by the Commission to finance the operation of this chapter. 
E.  "Allowable Legal Expenses" Shall include Attorney's Fees and costs incurred in connection with successful good faith attempts to recover Rents owing and successful good faith unlawful detainer actions not in derogation of applicable Law, to the extent same are not recovered from Tenants. 
F.  "Allowable Legal Expenses" Shall not include Attorneys' Fees and costs incurred in proceedings before the Commission. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 6, 1991; Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(3), 1989)  
15.48.270 - Presumption of fair Base Year Net Operating Income. 
Except as provided in Section 15.48.280, it Shall be presumed that the Net Operating Income produced by a Property during the Base Year provided a fair return on Property. Owners Shall be entitled to maintain and increase their Net Operating Income from Year to Year in accordance with Article VI of this chapter. 
(Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C) (4), 1989)  
15.48.280 - Rebutting the presumption. 
It May be determined that the Base Year Net Operating Income yielded other than a fair return on Property in which case, the Base Year Net Operating Income May be adjusted accordingly. In order to make such a determination, the Hearing Officer Must make at least one of the Following findings: 
A.  The Owner's operating and maintenance expenses in the Base Year were unusually high or low in comparison to other Years. In such instances, adjustments May be made in calculating such expenses so the Base Year Operating Expenses reflect average expenses for the Property over a reasonable period of time. The Hearing Officer Shall consider the Following factors: 
1.  The Owners made substantial Capital Improvements during 1986 which were not reflected in the Rent levels on the Base Date; 
2.  Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster or vandalism which management has taken appropriate action to reduce; 
3.  Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of Housing Services; 
4.  Other expenses were unreasonably high or low not withstanding the Following of prudent Business measures. 
B.  The Rental rates on the Base Date were disproportionate due to enumerated factors below. In such instances, adjustments May be made in calculating gross Rents consistent with the purpose of this chapter. 
1.  The Rental rates on the Base Date were substantially higher or lower than in Preceding Months by reason of premiums being charged or rebates being given for reasons unique to particular units or limited to the period determining the base Rent. 
2.  The Rent on the Base Date was substantially higher or lower than at other times of the Year by reason of seasonal demand or seasonal variations in Rent. 
3.  The Rental rates on the Base Date were exceptionally high or low due to other factors which would cause the Application of the Base Year Net Operating Income to result in gross inequity to either the Owner or Tenant. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 7, 1991; Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(5), 1989)  
15.48.290 - Determination of Base Year Net Operating Income. 
A.  To determine the Net Operating Income during the Base Year, there Shall be deducted from the annualized Gross Income being realized in 1986, a sum equal to the actual Operating Expenses for calendar Year 1986, unless the Owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Hearing Officer that some other consecutive twelve-month period is justified by reason consistent with the purpose of Articles V and VI of this chapter. 
B.  In the event the Owner did not own the subject Property during the Base Year, the Operating Expenses for 1986 Shall be determined by one of the Following methods, whichever the Hearing Officer determines to be more reliable in the particular case: 
1.  The previous Owner's actual Operating Expenses as defined in Section 15.48.260(C) if such figures were available; or 
2.  Actual Operating Expenses for the first calendar Year of ownership, discounted to 1986 by the schedule in Article VI of this chapter. 
(Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(6), 1989)  
15.48.300 - Determination of Current Year Net Operating Income. 
To determine the Current Year Net Operating Income, there Shall be deducted from the annualized Gross Income, determined by annualizing the monthly Rents in effect at the time of filing of a petition, a sum equal to the actual Operating Expenses for the last calendar Year, unless the Owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Hearing Officer that some other consecutive twelve-month period is justified by reasons consistent with the purposes of this section. 
(Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(7), 1989)  
15.48.310 - Schedule of increases in Operating Expenses. 
Where scheduling of Rental increases, or other calculations, require Projections of income and expenses, it Shall be assumed that Operating Expenses, exclusive of Property taxes, and management expenses, increases at five percent per Year, that Property taxes increase at two percent per Year and that management expenses constitute five percent of Gross Income. 
(Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(8), 1989)  
15.48.320 - Allowable special Rent adjustment. 
The Commission May Permit special Rent adjustments, unless otherwise prescribed by Law, such that the Owner's Net Operating Income will be increased at the rate of sixty percent of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the Base Year. The CPI for the Base Year Shall be determined by Use of the monthly figure for January, 1987 (January, 1987 CPI = 113.4). For purposes of initiating a special Rent adjustment, the percentage increase in the CPI Shall be calculated by dividing the most recently reported monthly CPI figure at the time of receipt of the Owner's petition for increase by 113.4. The percentage increase in the CPI is the amount by which the resulting figure exceeds a base of 1.00. 
For example, if the most recently reported monthly CPI figure at the time of receipt of the Owner's petition for increase were 128.4, the percentage increase in the CPI would be thirteen percent (128.4 ÷ 113.4 = 1.13; 1.13 - 1.00 base = 13%) so that the Hearing Officer could Permit, in such instance, an increase in the Owner's Net Operating Income of up to 7.8 percent maximum allowable net income increase. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 8 (part), 1991: Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(9), 1989)  
15.48.330 - Discretionary considerations. 
While the Net Operating Income formula should operate to guarantee a Park Owner a fair return on investment, the Commission considering a request for special Rent adjustments Shall consider all relevant factors in making a determination, as set forth in Section 15.48.230. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 8 (part), 1991: Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(10), 1989)  
15.48.335 - Consideration of refinancing debt. 
A.  The Commission May consider increased costs associated with refinancing of mortgage or debt when such costs are limited to increases in interest payments from those interest payments made during the Base Year which result from either: 
1.  Refinancing of the outstanding principal owed for the acquisition of a Park, where such refinancing is mandated by the terms of a financing transaction entered into prior to January 1, 1987 (e.g., termination of a loan with a balloon payment); or 
2.  Increased interest costs incurred as a result of a variable interest rate loan Used to finance the acquisition of the Park and entered into prior to January 1, 1987. 
B.  Special Rent adjustments based upon increased costs associated with refinancing Shall be allowed only where the Owner can show that the terms of the refinancing were reasonable and consistent with prudent Business practices under the circumstances. To the extent that refinancing does not benefit the subject Park, e.g., amounts of money are being Used for the purpose of leveraging other investments rather than benefiting the Park, such amount Shall not be considered. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 9, 1991)  
15.48.340 - Limit on special Rent adjustments pending hearing or litigation. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no special Rent adjustment in a Mobilehome Park Shall be valid during the time that any hearing proceeding is being conducted pursuant to this chapter, nor Shall such a special Rent adjustment be valid during the period in which a Commission Decision for that Park is being reviewed by a Court of competent jurisdiction, except the Tenants Shall be required to pay any general Rent Increase that has been properly Noticed and imposed pursuant to Section 15.48.220. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 10, 1991: Ord. 0-19A-89 § 1.07(C)(11), 1989)  
15.48.345 - Compliance with the code condition precedent to general Rent Increase or special Rent adjustment. 
No Owner Shall be entitled to a general Rent Increase or a special Rent adjustment if the Owner has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter or any implementing regulation issued by the Commission, including any provisions or regulations requiring the payment of registration Fees and registration penalties. Nor Shall any Owner be entitled to a general Rent Increase or a special Rent adjustment if the Owner has failed to comply substantially with any applicable State or Local housing, health or safety Law. No Owner Shall be entitled to a general Rent Increase or a special Rent adjustment unless the Notice increasing Rent contains a statement in substantially the Following form: 
The undersigned (Owner) certifies that the Rental space(s) subject to this Rent Increase and the common areas of the Park are not subject to any uncorrected citation or Notices of Violation of any State or Local housing, health or safety Laws issued by any government official or agency. 
If an Owner fails to comply with this section, the Tenant May refuse to pay the improperly Noticed increase, May seek administrative or civil remedies under this chapter and May raise the Owner's noncompliance as an affirmative defense in any resulting unlawful detainer action. 
(Ord. 0-11-91 § 11, 1991)  
15.48.350 - Rent decreases for reduction in services. 
A.  No Owner Shall reduce the level or kind of services provided to Tenants as of the date of adoption of the Ordinance codified in this chapter or take any other punitive action in retaliation for the exercise by Tenants of any of the rights granted by this chapter. 
B.  If a Mobilehome Park provides in the Rent, without separate charge, utilities or similar services (including, but not limited to natural Gas, electricity, water, sewer, trash, cable television) and converts to separate metering, separate charge or other lawful means of transferring to the Tenant the obligation for payment for such services, the cost savings Shall be passed through to Tenants by a Rent reduction equal to the actual cost to the Park of such transferred Utility or similar service (less common area usage) based on costs for the twelve-month period prior to Notice to the Tenants of the change. 
C.  For purposes of subsection (B) of this section, in determining cost savings to be passed on to Tenants in the form of decreased Rent, the cost of installation of separate Utility meters, or similar costs incurred by the Owner to shift the obligation for payment of Utility costs to the Tenants Shall not be considered. However, this Shall not be construed to prohibit or prevent the consideration of inclusion of such costs as an increased operating expense at mediation or arbitration. 
D.  If a service other than a Utility or similar service as defined in this section is reduced or eliminated, or if a Utility or similar service is reduced or eliminated without a concomitant decrease in Rent as provided for in subsection (B) of this section, any aggrieved Party May petition the Commission for hearing to resolve the Matter provided that: 
1.  Any petition initiating the hearing process Must be filed within twelve Months of the date on which the service was reduced or eliminated; and 
2.  The reduction or elimination in services Must continue to exist at the time of the hearing. Rent decreases Shall only be granted prospectively.

The Commission may, at its discretion, request Written records or other documentation from any Park Owner regarding the operations of any Park in order to assure compliance with allowable Rents, to respond to any complaint filed by a Tenant, and to properly administer this chapter. Failure to respond in a reasonable period of time to the Written request of the Commission for records or other related documentation regarding the operation of a Park Shall constitute a Violation of this chapter subject to the penalty provisions of Sections 15.48.630 and 15.48.640.

16.58.020 - Definitions. 
The Following definitions Shall govern the meaning of words in this chapter, unless from the context in which the word is Used, a different meaning is clearly intended: 
A.  "Park" means a Parcel or contiguous Parcels of land which is owned, operated and maintained by a public agency or private association and which provides recreational land and facilities for the benefit and enjoyment of the Residents of the Subdivision and of Persons residing, working or visiting in the City. Parks May be classified as community Parks, including community centers, athletic facilities, large multiuse Swimming Pools, picnic areas, cultural centers or similar facilities; public neighborhood Parks, including playground equipment, sports Fields, and picnic areas; and private neighborhood Parks, generally intended to serve only the immediate Subdivision/Development or specified planned community in which they are located. Parks May also include, or be limited to Open Space areas suitable for active or passive Uses. 
B.  " Park and Recreational Facilities" means any public Improvements deemed necessary by the City to develop, improve or rehabilitate land and facilities for Park and Recreational purposes. Such Improvements May include but not be limited to grading; landscaped areas for active and passive recreational Use, Open Space and sports Fields; irrigation and drainage systems; lawn, shrubs and trees; facilities for recreational community gardening; walkways; Bicycle facilities and Park lighting; playground or other recreational equipment; picnic facilities; community center or other Buildings, Swimming Pools; volleyball, basketball, tennis, racquetball and other Courts; Vehicle Driveways and parking areas and any other facilities which May hereafter be authorized by state Law or Approved by the City. 
C.  "Private Open Space" means that privately owned land and facilities for Park and Recreation purposes provided within a Subdivision and perpetually maintained and operated by the future Residents or Owner of the Subdivision, which land and facilities can be credited against the dedication and payment requirements established in this chapter, when the Following criteria are met: 
1.  That the private Park land meet a minimum size requirement of one-third (0.3) acre; 
2.  That the proposed private Park land be reasonably adaptable for Use for Park and Recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, Access and location of the private Park land; 
3.  That the Following areas or Subdivision design features Shall not be eligible for private Park credit; Yards, Court areas, Setbacks, Subdivision edges, landscaped Subdivision entries, greenbelts, meandering streams and circulation Improvements such as Bicycle, hiking and equestrian trails; 
4.  That the location of the land provide convenient Access to housing and Schools; 
5.  That the perpetual private ownership and maintenance of the land is adequately provided for by a recorded Written agreement; and 
6.  That the Use of the private Park land is perpetually restricted for Park and Recreational purposes which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City Council and in no event without providing equivalent Park and Recreational space elsewhere in the Subdivision. 
D.  "Fair Market Value" means the value of the land being subdivided based upon the current assessed value, modified to equal Market Value in accordance with the current practice of the County Assessor, or at the option of City based upon an appraisal by a qualified appraiser selected by City. In the event the Subdivider disagrees with this Fair Market Value determination, the Subdivider May select a qualified appraiser who, together with the original appraiser, Shall select a third qualified appraiser. The three appraisers so selected Shall conduct a Fair Market Value analysis of the Property and their determination Shall be binding upon the City and the Subdivider for the purposes of this chapter. All costs of appraisal Shall be paid by the Subdivider prior to the recordation of any final map or the issuance of any Building Permit. The Fair Market Value Shall be determined as of the time the final map or Parcel map is filed. With regards to any Park and Recreation Improvements or equipment provided by the Subdivider, the Fair Market Value Shall be the actual cost to acquire, construct or install the Improvement or equipment. 
(Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.030 - Park dedication required. 
As a condition of Approval of a tentative or final tract map or Parcel map for a residential Subdivision, the Subdivider Shall be required to dedicate land, pay a Fee in lieu thereof or both, at the option of the City, in the amount provided in this chapter, for Park or recreational purposes, unless the Subdivider is exempted from this requirement by the express provisions of this chapter. The dedication of land and/or payment of a Fee Shall be at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.040 - Standards for determining dedication. 
A.  General. If the Park dedication is required under Section 16.58.030, the Park area required Shall be determined in accordance with the standards provided in this section. 
B.  Standard of Park Area to Population. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare of the Residents of the City require that three acres of Property for every one thousand Persons residing within the City be devoted to Local Park and Recreational purposes, and that such Park area is necessary to provide for the needs of the current and future Persons residing and working in the City. Said ratio of .003 is hereafter referred to as the Park area standard. 
C.  Dwelling Unit Occupancy Factor. The Dwelling Unit Occupancy Factor for each type of Dwelling Unit Shall be established by Resolution and based on the most recent available U.S. Census Data. These figures May be revised from time to time by Resolution. 
D.  Computation of Area of Park to be Dedicated. The dedication of Park land required for any Subdivision Shall be determined by multiplying the number of Dwelling Units in the Subdivision for each housing type by the Occupancy factor for each housing type by .003 (i.e., the ratio of the Park area standard of three acres to one thousand population). This is represented as follows: 
(# Dwelling Units) (Occupancy factor) 
(3/1,000) = Area of Park to be dedicated 
E.  Qualification of Land Being Dedicated. In addition to meeting the requirements set forth in this section, any land offered for Park dedication Shall meet the criteria specified in Section 16.58.060(D). 
F.  Recent Park Development Surveys indicate a Development cost of one hundred ten thousand eight hundred sixteen dollars per acre for Improvements to Park and Recreation Facilities. This cost applies to seventy-eight acres of new Parkland for a total cost of eighty-six thousand four hundred thirty-six dollars and forty-eight cents. The recommended and Approved cost recovery level for Improvements to Park and Recreation Facilities is fifty percent or forty-three thousand two hundred eighteen dollars and twenty-four cents.

16.58.050 - Fees in lieu of dedication. 
When Permitted by Section 16.58.060, the Subdivider May pay to the City a Fee in lieu of making such dedication. The Fee Shall be computed by multiplying the area of Park to be dedicated under Section 16.58.040(D) by the Fair Market Value of the land being developed plus the Subdivision's fair share contributions to cover the cost of Park Improvements. 
(Ord. 0-06-00 § 1 (part), 2000: Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.060 - Determination of dedication, Fees or combination. 
A.  Dedication Generally Required. Where a Park or Recreational Facility has been Designated in the General Plan of the City or other adopted Resolution policy or standard of the City, and is to be located in whole or in Part within the proposed Subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the Residents of the Subdivision and other members of the public, the Subdivider Shall dedicate land for a Park and provide Recreational Facilities thereon as provided in this chapter unless the City determines that dedication is not desirable as provided in this section. The Fair Market Value of the land and Recreational Facilities provided by the Subdivider's obligations hereunder. If the Fair Market Value of the Park and Recreational Facilities provided is less than that required hereunder, the difference Shall be paid by the Subdivider as an in-lieu Fee. 
B.  In-Lieu Fees. Where no Park or Recreational Facility located in whole or in Part within the proposed Subdivision is Designated in the General Plan of the City or other adopted Resolution policy or standard of the City, the Subdivider Shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a Fee computed in accordance with Section 16.58.050 to be Used for Park and Recreational purposes to serve the Residents of the area being subdivided and other members of the public. 
C.  Combination of Land and Fees. The City May accept a combination of land and Fees, with the respective amounts to be determined in the sole discretion of the City, so long as the aggregate Fair Market Value plus in-lieu Fees does not exceed the limits established in this chapter. 
D.  Determination of Land or Fee. Whether the City accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a Fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, Shall, in the City's sole discretion, be determined by consideration of the Following: 
1.  The provisions of the City's General Plan, any specific plan adopted thereto, and any other adopted Resolution, policy or regulation of the City; 
2.  Topography, geology, Access and location of land in the Subdivision available for dedication; 
3.  Size and shape of the Subdivision and land available for dedication; 
4.  The feasibility of dedication; 
5.  Access and location of other Park sites to Subdivision; and 
6.  Need of other accessible Park sites for Development, Improvement and rehabilitation. 
The determination of the City as to whether land Shall be dedicated, or whether a Fee Shall be charged, or a combination thereof, Shall be final and conclusive. 
E.  In-Lieu Fees for Subdivisions of Fifty Parcels or Less. If the Subdivision contains fifty Parcels or less, only the payment of in-lieu Fees May be required, except that Condominium, stock cooperative or community Apartment Projects May be required to dedicate land if they have more than fifty Dwelling Units. 
(Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.070 - Subdivider credits. 
A.  Public Parks. The Subdivider Shall receive a credit against the Park dedication requirement for the Fair Market Value of any land dedicated and for the value of any Park and Recreation Improvements provided by Subdivider in conjunction with any public Park. The value of such Improvements Shall be determined by City based upon Section 16.58.020(D). 
B.  Private Park. In conjunction with any Planned Development, real estate Development, stock cooperative, community Apartment or Condominium, as defined by State Law, if the Subdivider provides Private Open Space as defined in Section 16.58.020, then the Subdivider May receive a credit equal to the Fair Market Value of the Private Open Space against the Park dedication requirement of this chapter, but such credit Shall not exceed one-third of such Park dedication requirement. The actual amount of such credit Shall be determined by the City based upon the comparability of the Private Open Space to public Park area and the adequacy of such Private Open Space to serve the needs of the Subdivision for active recreational Uses. 
C.  Application of Credits. The credits provided in this section Shall be applied to reduce the Subdivider's obligation to dedicate and/or pay an in-lieu Fee as required under this chapter, but only to the extent of such credit. 
(Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.080 - Disposition of land or Fees. 
The amount and location of land to be dedicated or the Fees to be paid Shall bear a reasonable relationship to the Use of the Park and Recreational Facilities by the future inhabitants of the Subdivision. In accordance with Government Code Section 66477, it is expressly acknowledged that the land to be dedicated or Fees to be paid May be for both neighborhood and community Parks. In addition, such Fees May be Used to improve or rehabilitate existing Parks. Fees paid by a Subdivider pursuant to this chapter May be spent to develop, improve and rehabilitate community and neighborhood Parks even though such Parks May be Used by Nonresidents of the Subdivision, so long as the benefit of the Park and Recreational Facilities to Residents of the Subdivision is reasonable in relation to the location of the Park and amount of the Fees. 
(Ord. 0-10-88 § 1 (part), 1988)  
16.58.090 - Time of dedication or payment of Fees. 
All Park Fees Shall be paid directly to the City cashier upon the date of final inspection, or the date the certificate of Occupancy is issued, whichever occurs last, provided that the City May require payment on a pro rata basis for each Dwelling or upon a percentage of Dwellings when they have received final inspection or certificate of Occupancy, whichever occurs last. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City May require earlier payment of such Fees if necessary to reimburse the City for previous expenditures or if the Fees are collected for Park and Recreation Improvements where the City has established an account, appropriated funds, and adopted a construction schedule or plan for the Park and Recreation Improvements prior to final inspection or certificate of Occupancy. In the event of dedication, dedication Shall be made at the time of recordation of the final map.

Chapter 18.01 - TITLE AND PURPOSES 
 
18.01.010 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the City of Colton Zoning Ordinance, hereafter referred to as the "Zoning Code or Code". 
(Ord. No. O-05-13, § 2(Exh. A(1)), 10-10-2013)  
18.01.020 - Authority. 
This Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the Colton General Plan, pursuant to the mandated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Section 65000 et seq.), California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.), and other applicable State and local requirements. 
(Ord. No. O-05-13, § 2(Exh. A(1)), 10-10-2013)  
18.01.030 - Purposes and objectives. 
It is the purpose and intent of the City Council that this Title promote the following purposes: 
A.  General. 
1.  To preserve and enhance the present qualities and advantages that exist in the City; 
2.  To promote the public health, safety, general welfare and preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of the City by providing regulations to ensure an appropriate mix of land uses in an orderly manner; 
3.  To encourage the most appropriate use of land, water and natural resources consistent with the public interest; 
4.  To overcome present problems and effectively manage future challenges that may result from the use and development of land and property; 
5.  To protect human, environmental, social, natural and economic resources; 
6.  To ensure that required on-site and off-site dedications and public improvements are properly installed or guaranteed; and 
B.  City and Region. 
1.  To ensure that development patterns should not blur or eradicate the edges of the city. Infill development within existing urban centers should conserve environmental resources, promote economic investment, and enhance social fabric, while reclaiming marginal and abandoned areas; 
2.  To prevent the impacts of both overcrowding of land and undue concentrations of population as well as the negative effects of leapfrogging sprawl and underutilization of land and property; 
3.  To restore downtown and existing urban centers and reconfigure conventional development into a City of real neighborhoods and diverse districts, to conserve natural environments, and preserve our built legacy; and 
4.  To support the physical organization of the region by a framework of transportation alternatives. Transit, pedestrian, and bicycle systems should maximize access and mobility throughout the region while reducing dependence upon the automobile. 
C.  Neighborhoods, District and Corridor. 
1.  To improve economic health and harmonious evolution of neighborhoods, districts and corridors through the use of graphic urban design codes that serve as predictable guides for change; 
2.  To develop transit corridors, when properly planned and coordinated, to help or organize the regional structure and revitalize urban centers. In contrast, highway corridors should not displace investment from existing centers; 
3.  To plan for appropriate building densities and land uses within walking distance of transit stops, permitting public transit to become a viable alternative to the automobile; 
4.  To concentrate civic, institutional, and commercial activity to be embedded in neighborhoods and districts, not isolated in remote, single-use complexes. Schools should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them; and 
5.  To organize a range of parks, from tot-lots and village greens to soccer fields/ball fields and community gardens should be distributed within neighborhoods. Conservation areas and open lands should be used to define and connect different neighborhoods and districts. 
D.  Block, Street and Building. 
1.  To place civic buildings and public gathering places on important sites to reinforce community identity and the culture of democracy. They deserve distinctive form because their role is different from that of other buildings and places that constitute the fabric of the city; 
2.  To ensure safety and security are considered as they are important in revitalizing of rural, urban, and special districts of the City. The design of streets and buildings should reinforce safe environments, but not at the expense of accessibility and openness; 
3.  To place all buildings so that they provide their inhabitants with a clear sense of location, weather and time. Natural methods of heating and cooling can be more resource-efficient than mechanical systems; 
4.  To adequately accommodate the automobile. It should do so in ways that respect the pedestrian and the form of public space; and 
5.  To place streets and squares to be designed in a safe, comfortable, and interesting manner to the pedestrian. Properly configured, they encourage walking and enable neighbors to know each other and protect their surroundings. 
E.  Implementation of the Colton General Plan. To coordinate and ensure the execution of the City's General Plan through effective implementation of development review requirements, adequate facility and services review and other goals, policies or programs contained in the General Plan. All development within the unincorporated area of the City's Sphere of Influence, should be consistent with the Colton General Plan. All development in the incorporated area of the City shall be consistent with the General Plan. 
F.  Comprehensive, Consistent and Equitable Regulations. To establish a system of fair, comprehensive, consistent and equitable regulations, standards and procedures for the review and approval of all proposed development, divisions, and mapping of land within the City in a manner consistent with State law. 
G.  Efficiently and Effectively Managed Procedures. To promote fair procedures that are efficient and effective in terms of time and expense and that appropriate process is followed in the review and approval of applications made under this Title; 
To be effective and responsive in terms of the allocation of authority and delegation of powers and duties among ministerial, appointed and elected officials; and 
To foster a positive customer service attitude and to respect the rights of all applicants and affected citizens. 
H.  Environmental Review. The City of Colton will conduct an environmental review of each project submitted for City approval in accordance with the City's adopted guidelines for implementing the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Depending on the nature and scope of the proposed project, an exemption, a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report may need to be completed. Negative declarations, mitigated negative declarations and environmental impact reports shall be prepared based on CEQA, implementing guidelines and City of Colton environmental guidelines. 
(Ord. No. O-05-13, § 2(Exh. A(1)), 10-10-2013)  
18.01.040 - Overall relationship to the general plan. 
The adoption of this Title is consistent and compatible with and furthers the goals, policies, objectives and programs of the General Plan. It is the intent of the City Council that all regulatory decisions made pursuant to this Title be consistent with the General Plan. 
For purposes of this Section, "consistency with the General Plan" means not only consistency with the Plan's land use and density designations, but also consistency with all elements, policies and programs of the General Plan, including those that promote compatibility of uses and densities, and orderly development consistent with available resources. 
(Ord. No. O-05-13, § 2(Exh. A(1)), 10-10-2013)  
18.01.050 - Relationship of zoning districts to the general plan. 
The establishment of zoning districts is intended to be one of the means of implementing the City's General Plan and any amendments thereto, as such implementation is permitted and required by State Law. The General Plan serves as a guideline and framework for the zoning and regulatory provisions of this Title. With respect to the Land Use and Housing Elements of the General Plan, there are goals, objectives and provisions for use categories and density ranges, but also for the achievement of other planning objectives such as appropriate mixing and buffering of uses to ensure overall compatibility.

K.  Similar Uses Permitted. When a use is not specifically listed in this Zoning Code, it shall be understood that the use may be permitted if it is determined by the Director that the use is similar to other uses listed. 
It is further recognized that every conceivable use cannot be identified in this Zoning Code, and anticipating that new uses will evolve over time, this Section establishes the Director's authority to compare a proposed use and measure it against those listed in this Zoning Code and the Standard Industrial Classification Manual for determining similarity. The Director may administer a fee via the Code Interpretation Letter in accordance with the most current adopted fee schedule. 
1.  In determining "similarity," the Director shall consider all of the following: 
a.  The proposed use meets the intent of, and is consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the General Plan; and 
b.  The proposed use meets the stated purpose and general intent of the district in which the use is proposed to be located; and 
c.  The proposed use will not adversely impact the public health, safety and general welfare of the City's residents; and 
d.  The proposed use shares characteristics common with, and not be of greater intensity, density or generate more environmental impact, than those uses listed in the land use district in which it is to be located. 
2.  Appeal. Any determination of similarity shall be final ten days after the date the Director's decision letter is issued, unless an appeal to the Planning Commission is filed and fees paid pursuant to adopted fee schedule.

1. Side setbacks May be reduced to five feet minimum with justification of hardship related to hillside protection or other hillside feature protection, subject to Planning Commission review and approval through Architectural and Site Plan Review. 
2. New structures or additions are prohibited within fifty vertical feet of a ridgeline unless this restriction precludes development of the property. An exception May be granted if the review authority finds the following: 
 a. There are no site development alternatives including clustering that avoid ridgeline development; 
 b. The density has been reduced to the minimum standards consistent with the General Plan density range; 
 c. No new subdivision of parcels is created that will result in ridgeline development; and 
 d. The proposed development will not have significant adverse visual impacts due to modifications in structural design including height, bulk, size, foundation, siting, and landscaping that avoid or minimize the visual impacts of the development. 
A.  Setbacks between structures and toes/tops of slopes. On adjacent lots having a difference in vertical elevation of three feet or more, the required side yard Shall be measured from the nearest toe or top of slope to the structure, whichever is closer. See Figure 2. 
Figure 2.
Side Setback Measurement 
 
B.  Height limitations. The maximum height for structures with a roof pitch of 3:12 or greater Shall be twenty-eight feet. If a roof pitch is less than 3:12, the maximum height Shall be twenty-four feet. 
1.  Siting restrictions/Protection of Ridgelines.

F.  Grading. Grading plans Shall be prepared in compliance with the Municipal Code, and the General Plan, which prohibits grading on slopes over thirty percent. Grading Shall utilize landform grading techniques provided in Section [18.41.030 G]. See Figure 6: Appropriate Grading. 
Grading in hillside areas should be the minimum necessary to be consistent with the other standards contained within the City's Municipal Code and General Plan Policies. Grading should be limited to that which is necessary for the primary use of each lot. Excessive grading outside of the building footprint and driveway area is discouraged. If necessary, all land form grading practices should be followed by the engineer of record as reviewed and approved by the City Public Works Department. 
Figure 6.
Appropriate Grading 
 
G.  Grading and Drainage Standards 
1.  Grading Plans. Grading plans will be designed and prepared by a registered civil engineer in accordance with compliance with all Colton Municipal Code requirements, other applicable codes, instituting best engineering/planning practices and restrictions determined by detailed studies of the geological, hydrological and soils conditions of the site. 
2.  Geotechnical Studies. In order to address the many potential unknown geological constraints of a hillside, areas such as potential unstable and steep slopes, possibly poorly compacted and partially compacted soils in low lying areas, and faults, geotechnical investigation, by an engineering geologist and a soils engineerregistered by the State of California, Shall be conducted as part of the Architectural and Site Plan Review conducted by the Planning Division and approved by the Planning Commission. 
3.  Natural Features. Significant natural landmarks and other outstanding hillside features Shall be maintained in the Natural State as determined by the City's Development Services Director. 
4.  Landform Grading. All natural slopes greater than five feet in height that require grading, landform grading (contour grading) Shall be used to simulate the appearance of the natural terrain. (See Figure 7 and 8.) 
Figure 7.
Landform Grading 
 
5.  Remedial Grading. Notwithstanding the limitations of this subsection, the Development Services Director May permit remedial grading pursuant to an Administrative Architectural and Site Plan Review. For the purposes of this Section, remedial grading is defined as grading necessary to mitigate an environmental hazard as recommended by a geotechnical report approved by City engineering staff. No such remedial grading will be allowed when it could be avoided by changing the position or location of the proposed development. Remedial grading that would result in substantial landform alteration Shall not be permitted where project alternatives, including but not limited to, deepened foundations, caissons, soldier piles could be utilized to provide equivalent geologic stability. Remedial grading Shall not be used to materially increase the buildable area of a project site. 
6.  Slope Repairs. When the gradient of the natural slope exceeds twenty percent, five-feet horizontal and one-feet vertical (5:1), slope benches and terraces must be used when fill is used to repair even a small portion of a slope. 
7.  Grading on Slopes Greater than twenty-five Percent Grade. Grading on naturally occurring slopes of twenty-five percent grade or more that are greater than twenty-five feet in height Shall not occur unless grading is for access and/or remedial purposes, and specifically approval by the City of Colton Architectural and Site Plan Review after geotechnical studies have been conducted by a soils engineer and an engineering geologist registered by the State of California. A detailed plan for slope stabilization Shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of any grading permits. 
8.  Maximum Slope Angle for Manufactured Slopes. No manufactured slope Shall have a slope angle steeper than two-feet horizontal to one-feet vertical (2:1). Shallower slope angles May be required if detailed soils and geological investigations indicate that they are necessary. 
9.  Preserving Existing Significant Riparian Habitats. Major natural drainage channels containing significant perennial vegetation that may constitute wildlife habitat should remain in their Natural State. 
10.  Maintenance. All drainage, open space/landscaped buffer areas, detention ponds and sediment basins must be continuously maintained on a monthly basis either by homeowners association or property owner or existing maintenance assessment district. 
11.  Street layout. Any new streets should follow the natural contours of the terrain to minimize the need for grading. Street width are subject to design review and should be narrow in width preserving hillside and providing adequate safe access subject Design Review process. Cul-de-sacs are prohibited and loop roads are encouraged where necessary to fit the natural topography, all subject to the approval of the City Engineer, Development Services Director and Fire Chief. 
12.  Grading for Roadways. Where placement of roads are near ridges or on slopes is proposed, acceptable roadway placements Shall include a split roadway section to accommodate grade, knob removal to accommodate views from the road, and the rounding of cut slopes to enhance appearance. See Figure 10. 
Figure 10.
Grading for Roadways on Hillsides 
 
Cut and Knob Removal 
  
 
Split Roadway is Preferred 
13.  When the established alignment of a road does not conform to the natural contours of slopes, excessively long stretches of manufactured straight embankments Shall not be permitted. Instead use undulated slope embankments as shown in the Figure 11 below: 
Figure 11.
Undulated Slope Embankments 
 
14.  View protection. New construction should not block views from other properties. 
a.  Where feasible, new structures and tall landscaping should not be placed directly in the view of the primary living areas on a neighboring parcel. 
b.  New structures should be placed on the lower areas of a hillside site. 
c.  Mechanical equipment May be placed on rooftops or below a deck only if the equipment is not visible from off the site, except for unobtrusive solar collectors that are compatible with the roof line and architecturally integrated with the structure. See Figure 12 below. 
Figure 12.
View Protection 
 
15.  Retaining walls. Large retaining walls in a uniform plane Shall be avoided. Retaining walls Shall be divided into terraces with variations in plane and include landscaping to break up the length of walls and to screen them from view. No retaining wall Shall be higher than six feet, and should incorporate a three foot recessed offset feature every thirty feet, or other methods of articulation. Retaining walls more than three feet high that are visible from off the site should be screened with landscaping. See Figure 13.

5.  A "substantial change in the mode of character of operation" shall not include: 
a.  Re-establishment, restoration or repair of an existing Off-Sale Alcoholic Beverage Sales Activity on the same Premises after the Premises have been rendered totally or partially inaccessible by a riot, insurrection, toxic accident or act of God, provided that the re-establishment, restoration or repair does not extend the hours of operation of any establishment or add to the capacity, floor or land area or shelf space devoted to Alcoholic Beverages of any establishment that sells any Alcoholic Beverages for off-site consumption. 
b.  Temporary closure for not more than 180 days in cases of vacation or illness or for purposes of repair, renovation, or remodeling if that repair, renovation, or remodeling does not change the nature of the Premises and does not extend the hours of operation of any establishment, or add to the capacity, floor or land area, or shelf space devoted to Alcoholic Beverages of any establishment that sells any Alcoholic Beverages for off-site consumption, provided notice is provided to the City.

18.48.120 - Parking Vehicles for Certain Purposes Prohibited. 
A.  The City Council of the City of Colton hereby finds and determines as follows: 
1.  The purpose of this section is to regulate the circumstances under which Persons May park their Vehicles in a manner that is not Permitted by Title 18 of this Code. This section is not intended to restrict any form of advertising that Vehicle Owners May place on or upon their Vehicles. The City Council finds that the regulations imposed by this section are intended to promote public safety and traffic flow by reducing visual distractions that are likely to cause traffic accidents. Moreover, the restrictions are intended to improve the visual appearance and discourage blighting of Properties in the City by eliminating unlicensed Vehicles Sales on unimproved Lots and Lots have not been developed with paving, drainage Improvements, and other Improvements and amenities that are normally required of Approved Vehicle dealerships. 
2.  The parking of Vehicles on Property that is not zoned for such Use causes adverse impacts to the Residents and Businesses in the City, including but not limited to, the leaking of gasoline and other motor fuels and oils into the ground and groundwater on unimproved Properties and Properties that have not been developed with sufficient infrastructure to handle such Use of Property and promoting unfair competition in the Sale of Vehicles. The regulations will directly advance the City's interests in public safety, efficient traffic flow, aesthetics and economic fairness by prohibiting Vehicle Sales on Properties that are not zoned for such activities and Properties that developed the appropriate infrastructure and amenities to safely accommodate such Sales. 
3.  These regulations are reasonably tailored to serve the City's substantial interests in public safety, efficient traffic flow, aesthetics and economic fairness because they do not restrict the ability of any Persons to advertise that their Vehicle is for Sale in Lots that are appropriately zoned nor do they restrict the ability of Persons to have Signs in or on their Vehicles advertising the Vehicle's availability or other commercial interests. These regulations are merely designed to restrict parking of Vehicles for the purpose of Sale on Lots that are not zoned for such activities and are ill-equipped to handle such intensity of Use, regardless of whether the Vehicle contains advertising or not. 
B.  No Person Shall park any Vehicle upon any Private Property for the principle purpose of displaying such Vehicle thereon for Sale, hire, lease, or Rental unless the Property is duly zoned and Permitted by the City to allow that type of Business at that location and no Person Shall allow the parking of any Vehicle upon any Private Property for the principal purpose of displaying such Vehicle thereon for Sale, hire, lease or Rental without having first obtained the necessary Permits and Approval from the City. 
C.  This section Shall not prohibit a Person from parking a Vehicle on Property on which such Person resides, for purposes of Sale, hire, lease or Rental, provided such Vehicle is registered to such Person and is otherwise Permitted by Title 18 of this Code. 
D.  For the purposes of this section, the term "Vehicle" Shall include both "Motor Vehicle" and "Vehicle" as defined in California Vehicle Code Sections 415 and 670. 
E.  Nothing in this section Shall be construed to prohibit the placement of any Sign, advertising or Notice on or upon any Vehicle.

The permits shall be issued in accordance with the application and permit approval process contained in this Chapters 18.48.130, 18.48.134 and resolutions adopted pursuant to this Chapter.

Twelve months after the first set of CMOPs have been issued, the City Manager or his or her designee shall deliver a report to the City Council during a regular meeting which examines the positive and negative impacts that the commercial marijuana cultivation businesses have had on the community during the preceding twelve months. The report shall include, among other things, an analysis of how the commercial marijuana cultivation businesses have complied with state and local regulations, any positive or negative community and law enforcement impacts, and any revenue generated.

If the City Council takes no action, or finds that the impacts are unacceptable, then the maximum number and type of commercial marijuana cultivation businesses authorized shall continue to be limited to two, as provided is subdivision (1) above.

The City may also modify, postpone, or cancel any request for applications, or the entire program under this Chapter, at any time without liability, obligation, or commitment to any party, firm, or organization. Persons submitting applications assume the risk that all or any part of the program, or any particular category of permit potentially authorized under this Chapter, may be cancelled at any time prior to permit issuance. The City further reserves the right to request and obtain additional information from any candidate submitting an application. In addition to any other justification provided a failure to comply with other requirements in this Chapter, an application risks being rejected for any of the following reasons:

a.  The application is filed less than sixty days before its expiration. 
b.  The CMOP is suspended or revoked at the time of the application.

d.  The commercial marijuana cultivation business has failed to conform to the requirements of this Chapter, or of any regulations adopted pursuant to this Chapter.

f.  If the City or state has determined, based on substantial evidence, that the permittee or applicant is in violation of the requirements of this Chapter, of the City's Municipal Code, or of the state rules and regulations, and the City or state has determined that the violation is grounds for termination or revocation of the CMOP. 
5.  The City Manager or his designee is authorized to make all decisions concerning the issuance of a renewal permit. In making the decision, the City Manager or his designee is authorized to impose additional conditions to a renewal permit, if it is determined to be necessary to ensure compliance with state or local laws and regulations or to preserve the public health, safety or welfare. Appeals from the decision of the City Manager or his designee shall be handled pursuant to Section 18.48.200 entitled "Appeals."

Should the State of California, or any of its departments or divisions, revoke or terminate the license of a medical cannabis business, such revocation or termination shall also revoke or terminate the ability of a commercial marijuana cultivation business to operate within the City of Colton. 
8.  Permittee Selection Process. 
A.  Selection and Review of Finalists. 
1.  The City Council shall adopt by resolution a procedure by which the top three applicants applying for a CMOP will be presented to the City Council for a final determination at a public hearing. 
2.  The top three finalists shall be invited to attend the City Council meeting, where they will be expected to make a public presentation introducing their team and providing an overview of their proposal. In order to provide adequate time, presentations may be divided over more than one meeting over multiple days as determined to be necessary. 
3.  At least ten days prior to the hearing, notice of the hearing shall be sent to all property owners located within three hundred feet of the proposed business locations of each of the finalists to be considered by the City Council. 
4.  The City Council shall rank the final three candidates and shall select two or more candidates to be issued a CMOP. The City Council's decision as to the selection of the candidate(s) to receive the permit(s) shall be final. 
5.  Official issuance of a CMOP, however, is conditioned upon the prevailing candidate(s) obtaining all required land use approvals and a fully approved and executed development agreement. Following the Council's selection, the prevailing candidate(s) shall apply to the City's planning department to obtain any required land use approvals or entitlements for the permittee's location, if any. Land use approvals shall include compliance with all applicable provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). After the applicant has been approved for a CMOP, the City Manager or his or her designee shall formally issue a CMOP once the City Manager or his or her designee and Chief of Police have both affirmed that all of the required land use approvals and a fully approved and executed development agreement have been obtained. 
If the selected permittee(s) is/are unable to fulfill all the requirements of obtaining the CMOP(s), the City Council, in its sole discretion, may award the permit to the next highest ranked finalist, or may begin the application process again to allow for selection of a new set of finalists. 
6.  Issuance of a CMOP does not create a land use entitlement. A commercial marijuana cultivation business permit shall only be for a term of twelve months, and shall expire at the end of the twelve-month period unless it is renewed as provided herein. Furthermore, no permittee may begin operations, notwithstanding the issuance of a permit, unless all of the state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of this Chapter and of the permit, have been complied with. 
7.  Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter to the contrary, the City Council reserves the right to reject any or all applications if it determines it would be in the best interest of the City, taking into account any health, safety and welfare impacts on the community. Applicants shall have no right to a CMOP until a permit is actually issued, and then only for the duration of the permit's term. Each applicant assumes the risk that, at any time prior to the issuance of a permit, the City Council may terminate or delay the program created under this Chapter. 
8.  If an application is denied, a new application may not be filed for one (1) year from the date of the denial. 
9.  A person or entity granted a CMOP shall be required to pay the permit fee established by resolution of the City Council, to cover the costs of administering the CMOP program created in this Chapter. 
B.  Prohibition on Transfer of CMOP(s). 
1.  No person may transfer ownership or control of a commercial marijuana cultivation business or transfer any CMOP issued under this Chapter. CMOP(s) are not a property right, and permittees have no economic interest in any permit issued to them. Permittees have no right to sell or transfer a CMOP to another party, or to have the City Council consider whether they should authorize the transfer of a CMOP to another party. Any attempt to transfer ownership of a commercial marijuana cultivation business or of a CMOP shall render the CMOP void. 
2.  Any attempt to transfer a CMOP or a commercial marijuana cultivation business shall result in the CMOP being declared immediately revoked and/or it is void and no longer of any effect. 
3.  In any situation where a permit has been lost as a result of an attempted transfer of the CMOP or of the commercial marijuana cultivation business, or as a result of the abandonment or revocation of the permit, any new permit shall be issued using the standard process for the issuance of permits in the first instance. No preference shall be given to any person proposed as new owner or assignee by the former permit holder. In such case, prior to accepting any new applications, the City shall post the availability of the CMOP at issue on the City's website. The City Manager or his/her designee may take other actions to help ensure the broadest pool of applicants for the new permit. 
9.  Grounds for Denial. The City Manager or designee shall reject an application upon making any of the following findings: 
A.  The applicant made one or more false or misleading statements or omissions on the application or during the application process; 
B.  The applicant is not the legal representative of the commercial marijuana cultivation facility; 
C.  The commercial marijuana cultivation facility is not permitted in the proposed area, is not an authorized use in the proposed area, or has not obtained a conditional use permit or other entitlement for the use; 
D.  The applicant, or any person who is managing or is otherwise responsible for the activities of the commercial marijuana cultivation facility has been convicted of a felony, or convicted of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or the illegal use, possession, transportation, distribution or similar activities related to controlled substances, as defined in the Federal Controlled Substances Act, with the exception of medical marijuana related offenses for which the conviction occurred after the passage of the Compassionate Use Act of 1996; 
E.  The applicant is not a party to a development agreement with the City concerning the terms of the development and use of the commercial marijuana cultivation facility. 
F.  If a license is required by state law, the applicant does not hold a state license for the proposed commercial marijuana cultivation or, if issued conditionally, does not obtain a state license as required. 
G.  The applicant's application failed to meet the requirements of this Chapter or of any other legal requirement that is a prerequisite to issuance of an application. 
10.  Limitations on City's Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the City shall not assume any liability whatsoever, with respect to approving any CMOP permit pursuant to this Chapter or the operation of any commercial marijuana cultivation facility approved pursuant to this Chapter.

18.48.170 - Density Bonus. 
A.  Purpose: The purpose of this Chapter is to provide incentives for the production of housing for very low-income, lower-income, moderate-income, special needs, and senior households in the City of Colton and to establish procedures for carrying out the legislative requirements and complying with California Government Code § 65915, et seq. In enacting this Chapter, it is the intent of the City to facilitate the development of affordable housing by positively impacting the economic feasibility of providing lower-income housing and implementing the goals, objectives, and policies of the City's Housing Element. 
B.  Applicability: This Chapter shall apply to all zoning districts, including mixed use zoning districts, where residential developments of five or more dwelling units are proposed and where the applicant seeks and agrees to provide low, very low, senior or moderate income housing units in the threshold amounts specified in state density bonus law such that the resulting density is beyond that which is permitted by the applicable zoning. This chapter and state density bonus law shall apply only to the residential component of a mixed use project and shall not operate to increase the allowable density of the nonresidential component of any proposed project. 
C.  Eligibility: The City shall grant one density bonus, with concessions or incentives, as specified in Section 18.59.040 (Density Bonuses and Incentives and Concessions Allowed), when the applicant for the residential development seeks and agrees to construct a residential development that satisfies the eligibility requirements pursuant to California Government Code §65915, et seq. 
D.  General Requirements: The following general requirements apply to the application and determination of all incentives and bonuses: 
1.  Rounding. All density calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
2.  Relation to General Plan, Zoning. The granting of a density bonus, or a concession or incentive, shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan Amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
3.  Density Bonus Excluded in Calculation. The density bonus shall not be included when calculating the total number of housing units that qualifies the housing development for a density bonus. 
4.  Waived or Reduced Development Standards. The City shall not apply any development standard that would have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the requirements of Section 18.59.020 (Eligibility) at the densities or with the incentives or concessions permitted by this Chapter. 
a.  An applicant may submit to the City a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards, when standards would have the effect of physically precluding the proposed development, and may request a meeting with the City. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be interpreted to require the City to waive or reduce development standards if: 
i.  The waiver or reduction would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of California Government Code § 65589.5 upon health and safety or the physical environment and for which the City determines there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. 
ii.  This would have an adverse impact on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources or City of Colton's list of historic landmark properties. 
iii.  The waiver or reduction would be contrary to state or federal law. 
5.  Multiple Zoning Districts. If the site of a development proposal is located in two or more zoning districts, the number of dwelling units permitted in the development is the sum of the dwelling units permitted in each of the zoning districts based on the site acreage within each zoning district. The permitted number of dwelling units may be distributed within the development without regard to the zone boundaries. 
6.  Land Donation. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to enlarge or diminish the authority of the City to require a developer to donate land as a condition of development. 
7.  Affordability Agreement or Covenant Required. 
a.  Prior to the award of a density bonus and any related incentives or concessions, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the City to ensure the continued affordability of all target units. 
b.  For all target units, the agreement shall specify the household income classification, number, location, size, and construction scheduling and shall require target units in a project and phases of a project to be constructed concurrently with the construction of non-target units. The agreement shall include such other provisions as necessary to establish compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. 
8.  Reports. The applicant shall submit financial or other reports along with the application for the project to establish compliance with this Chapter. 
E.  Density Bonuses and Incentives and Concessions Allowed: 
1.  Density Bonus. A housing development that satisfies the eligibility requirements shall be entitled to density bonus pursuant to California Government Code § 65915, et seq. 
2.  Number of Incentives or Concessions. In addition to the density bonus described in this Section, an applicant may request specific incentives or concessions. The applicant shall receive the number of incentives or concessions pursuant to California Government Code § 65915, et seq. The City shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless it makes a written finding of either of the following: 
a.  The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Health and Safety Code § 50052.5, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in subdivision (c). 
b.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of California Government Code § 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and/or City designated historic landmark, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households. 
c.  The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law. 
3.  Available Incentives and Concessions. 
a.  A reduction in the site development standards or a modification of this Title's requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with § 18901) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code, including but not limited to a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicle parking spaces that would otherwise be required and that results in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
b.  Approval of Mixed-Use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if the nonresidential land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and the nonresidential land uses are compatible with the housing development and existing or planned development in the area in which the housing development will be located. 
c.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the City that result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
d.  Priority processing of a housing development that qualifies for a density bonus based on income-restricted units. 
4.  Additional Density Bonus and Incentives and Concessions for Donation of Land to the City. 
a.  The provisions of pursuant to California Government Code § 65915, et seq. shall govern.

a.  Housing developments meeting the requirements of Section 18.59.020 (Eligibility) and including a child-care facility that will be located on the premises of, as part of, or adjacent to the housing development shall receive additional density bonus of incentives pursuant to pursuant to California Government Code § 65915, et seq. 
b.  Notwithstanding any other requirements of this Section, the City shall not be required to provide a density bonus or incentive or concession for a child-care facility if it makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child-care facilities. 
F.  Condominium Conversion Incentives for Low-Income Housing Development. 
1.  An applicant for approval to convert apartments to a condominium project may submit to the City a preliminary proposal pursuant to this subsection prior to the submittal of any formal requests for subdivision map approvals. The City shall, within ninety days of receipt of a written proposal, notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which it will comply with this subsection. 
2.  The City shall grant one density bonus, with concessions or incentives, as specified in Section 18.59.040 (Density Bonuses and Incentives and Concessions Allowed), when the applicant for the residential development seeks and agrees to construct a residential development, excluding any units permitted by the density bonus awarded pursuant to this Chapter, that satisfies the eligibility requirements pursuant to California Government Code § 65915.5, et seq. 
3.  For purposes of this subsection, "other incentives of equivalent financial value" shall not be construed to require the City to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation but may include the reduction or waiver of requirements which the City might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval. 
4.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require the City to approve a proposal to convert apartments to condominiums. 
5.  An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or other incentives under this subsection if the apartments proposed for conversion constitute a housing development for which a density bonus or other incentive was previously provided. 
G.  Location of Density Bonus Units: The location of density bonus units within the housing development may be at the discretion of the developer. However, the target units shall be dispersed throughout the housing development and when feasible shall contain, on average, the same number of bedrooms as the non-target units in the development, and shall be compatible with the design or use of the remaining units in terms of appearance, materials, and quality finish. 
H.  Continued Availability: 
1.  If a housing development provides lower- or very low-income target units to qualify for a density bonus, the target units must remain restricted to lower- or very low-income households for the minimum period required by California Government Code § 65915, et seq. 
2.  In the case of a common interest housing development providing moderate-income target units to qualify for a density bonus, the initial occupant of the target unit must be a person or family of moderate income. Upon resale, the seller shall ensure that the target unit is sold for not more than affordable housing costs, as prescribed in State law and any applicable affordability agreement/covenant recorded against the target unit. 
3.  Where there is a direct financial contribution to a housing development pursuant to Government Code § 65916, the City shall assure continued availability for the minimum period required by California Government Code § 65916.

18.48.180 - Reasonable Accommodations. 
A.  Purpose. It is the policy of the City of Colton to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to provide reasonable accommodation in the application of its zoning or building laws, policies or procedures for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing. The purpose of this section is to establish the process for making a request for reasonable accommodation. For purposes of this section, the term "disabled" or "disability" shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. 
B.  Application. 
1.  Any person who requests reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, in the application of a zoning or building law, policy or procedure, which may act as a barrier to fair housing opportunities, may do so by filing a completed application with the Director of Development Services ("Director"). The Director shall promulgate application forms for this purpose. 
2.  If the project for which the request is being made also requires some other approval, permit or entitlement, the applicant shall file the request together with the application for such approval, permit or entitlement. 
C.  Required information. The applicant shall provide the following information: 
1.  Applicant's name, address, and telephone number; 
2.  Address of the property for which the request is being made; 
3.  The current actual use of the property; 
4.  A description of the accommodation requested including reference to the Code provision, policy or procedure from which modification is being requested; 
5.  The basis for the claim that the applicant is considered disabled under the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 or the California Fair Employment Housing Act; and 
6.  A detailed explanation of why the accommodation is reasonable and why the accommodation is necessary to afford the applicant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a specific dwelling in the City. 
D.  Notice of request for accommodation. Written notice of a request for reasonable accommodation shall be given as follows: 
1.  In the event that there is no approval sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation, the notice shall be mailed to the owners of record of all properties which are immediately adjacent to the property which is the subject of the request. 
2.  In the event that the request is being made in conjunction with some other approval, permit or entitlement, the notice shall be transmitted along with the notice of the other proceeding. 
E.  Procedure. 
1.  The Director shall review each application for reasonable accommodation and, within five days of receipt thereof, determine whether the application is complete. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the Director shall promptly give the applicant written notice of the additional information necessary to complete the application. 
2.  Within thirty days of receipt of an application that has been determined to be complete, the Director shall complete a review of the application and, pursuant to the standards provided in this section, either approve, approve subject to conditions or deny the request. However, in the event that the applicant also seeks an approval, permit or other entitlement that is reviewed by the planning commission, then the planning commission shall review the application for reasonable accommodation. 
3.  The Director shall give the applicant written notice of the Director's decision. Notice of the Director's decision shall also be given in the same manner as provided in Section 4. above. 
4.  Within ten days of the date the notice is mailed, any person may appeal the Director's decision in the manner provided in Sections 18.58.030(F)(2) and 18.58.030(F)(3) of this Code. 
5.  If no appeal is received within ten days, the decision shall become final. 
F.  Grounds for accommodation. In making a determination about the reasonableness of a requested accommodation, the following factors shall be considered: 
1.  Whether the accommodation is reasonable considering the nature of the applicant's disability, the surrounding land uses, and the rule, standard, policy, or practice from which relief is sought; 
2.  Whether the accommodation is necessary to afford the applicant equal opportunity to enjoy and use a specific dwelling in the City; 
3.  Whether the accommodation will have only incidental economic or monetary benefits to the applicant, and whether the primary purpose of the accommodation is to assist with real estate speculation or excess profit taking; 
4.  Whether the accommodation will create a substantial adverse impact on surrounding land uses, or a public nuisance, that cannot be reasonably mitigated; 
5.  Whether the accommodation is reasonably feasible considering the physical attributes of the property and structures; 
6.  Whether there are alternative accommodations which may provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant, while minimizing adverse impacts on surrounding land uses and lessening the financial and/or administrative burden on the City; 
7.  Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City; and 
8.  Whether the requested accommodation would constitute a fundamental alteration of the zoning or building laws, policies or procedures of the City. 
G.  Expiration of grants of reasonable accommodation. Any modification granted for an individual with a disability shall be a personal accommodation for the individual applicant and shall not run with the land, unless the Director determines that it would be impractical to require the property to be returned to its previous condition once the disabled person no longer occupies the property. Prior to the issuance of a building permit or any other applicable permit for such modification, the permittee shall execute a notarized statement that permits the City to inspect the affected property at least annually to verify compliance with this section and with any applicable conditions of approval. Prior to any transfer of interest in the property, the permittee shall notify the transferee of the existence of the accommodation, the personal status of the accommodation and the requirements that the tranferee must apply for a new accommodation as necessary. Except as otherwise provided by the Director, as set forth herein, once such transfer takes effect the accommodation shall have no further validity.

Green Belt Front Door Access Ways 
 
Small Parks and enhanced sidewalks 
 
F.  Architecture Styles of Compact Homes. 
1.  The City of Colton's heritage is rich with a variety of early American architecture styles. While it is the City of Colton's objective is to "Encourage the assemblage of Compact lots to create more cohesive development sites" (General Plan Land Use Policy LU-1.5), new homes should reflect an architectural style that is presently part of the City's historical resources inventory (this is not an exhaustive list, but meant to be a guideline to follow): 
Bungalow 	Beaux Arts 
Craftsman 	Colonial Revival 
Prairie box 	Neoclassical 
New England Saltbox 	Queen Anne 
Spanish Colonial 	Spanish Revival

2.  Interior Lot or Project Perimeter Fencing: Preferred materials include decorative concrete block wall or vinyl fencing. If wood is going to be used as fence material or on the exterior of buildings, the Home Owners Association (HOA) Shall include a maintenance program to address regular maintenance schedule on all fences or exterior wood materials used for the development project. Wood fencing is not permitted material for project perimeter fencing. 
G.  Compact Lot Infill Subdivision Design Options. 
1.  Builders and designers should consider all possible subdivision configurations that take advantage of the site topography in providing sufficient open space/green belts, and consider how characteristics of the street and adjacent structures affect the overall form and orientation of the proposed development. When designing your compact lot subdivision, the following design criteria should be considered: 
a)  Configure or design homes to front public streets, primary entryway, circulation walkways, and open spaces, rather than driveways. 
b)  For homes not adjacent to the public street, provide pedestrian circulation in the form of private walkways or clearly delineated paths of travel from the sidewalk to their entryway. 
c)  Maximize green space while minimizing the total amount of driveway space. 
d)  Take advantage of existing topography and natural features to maintain appropriate grade levels consistent with surrounding structures. 
e)  Homes fronting a public street should have the primary entrance and main windows facing the street. 
f)  Pedestrian environment along the edge of the development should feature pleasant landscaping and trees. 
g)  Enhanced paving should mark the pedestrian and vehicular entries of complexes to provide a sense of arrival. 
h)  Design floor plan layouts in relation to lot shape, width, and depth to maximize usable outdoor spaces including space to store trash collection containers. 
i)  Provide space for entry, front landing, and transitional landscaping (lush, drought resistant landscaping) between the public sidewalk and private entryway. 
j)  Provide direct paths of travel for pedestrian destinations within the development. 
k)  Vary building placement to increase variation in facades and more articulated building edges. 
l)  While the homes are designed to be placed to provide adequate access to the garages for cars and with adequate side yards, the interior spaces are arranged so that windows and balconies do not directly face each other. This creates a better sense of privacy for homes that are closely spaced. 
2.  Compact Lot Infill Subdivision Design Options. 
Where rear driveways are used 
 
Where rear T-driveways are used 
 
Where alternative T-driveway are used to separate rear units from the street and sidewalk 
 
3.  Compact Lot Infill Subdivision Design Options (Continued). 
Where L-driveways are used 
 
Where alternative L-driveways are used 
 
Where side access driveways are used

1.  A Homeowners Association with a Maintenance Agreement as part of the Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&Rs) Shall be required, composed of all property owners, to maintain all common areas such as trees, landscaping, trash, parking, community driveway, walkways, monthly service for private fire hydrant (if required), etc. Each owner and future property owners Shall automatically become members of the association and Shall be subject to a proportionate share of the maintenance. 
2.  Each property owner Shall be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of two car parking garage in compact lot subdivision. Garages must be usable and available for the parking of vehicles at all times and such language must be included in recorded Covenant and Agreement(s) related to maintenance and reciprocal private easements pertaining to said projects. 
3.  Recorded Covenant and Agreement(s) will be required for all reciprocal private easements.

The application shall be accompanied by any fees as specified by City Council resolution. 
C.  Review Criteria for Sign Permit. 
1.  Criteria for Approval. A Sign permit may be Approved when it complies with the standards and requirements of this chapter. A permit application may be Approved subject to conditions, so long as those conditions are required by this chapter or some other applicable law, rule, or regulation. 
2.  Multiple Sign Applications. When an application proposes two or more Signs, the application may be granted in whole or in part, with separate decisions as to each proposed Sign. When an application is denied in whole or in part, written notice of determination shall specify the ground for such denial. 
3.  Revocation or Cancellation. The Development Services Director shall revoke any Approval or permit upon refusal by the permit holder to comply with the provisions of the permit after written notice of noncompliance and at least thirty days' opportunity to correct. This provision does not apply in the event that the Sign, by nature of its physical condition, is an imminent and significant threat to public safety. 
4.  Permits Issued in Error. Any Approval or permit issued in error may be revoked by the City upon written notice to the permit holder of the reason for the revocation. 
D.  Uniform Sign Program. 
1.  Purpose. The purpose of the Uniform Sign Program is to adopt unique and specific design and development standards for individual multi-tenant and mixed use developments. The intent is to integrate a project's Signs with the design of the structures to achieve a unified architectural statement. A Uniform Sign Program provides a means for defining common Sign regulations for multi-tenant projects, to encourage maximum incentive and latitude in the design and display of multiple Signs and to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this title. 
2.  Review Procedure. Review and Approval of a Uniform Sign Program is the responsibility of the Planning Commission. The Development Services Director may make a recommendation on the program to the Commission, and the Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the program. Additionally, the Planning Commission shall be the approving authority for modifications and amendments to Uniform Sign Programs, except that the Development Services Director may be the approving authority for minor modifications that do not change or modify the intent or conditions of the original Approval. The Design Review Committee may elevate the decision to the Planning Commission. 
3.  Standards. The Uniform Sign Program shall include criteria for building-attached and freestanding Signs, including Directional Signs, for tenants, anchors, and the integrated development itself to establish consistency of Sign type, location, Logo and/or letter height, lines of Copy, illumination, and construction details of Signs for the project. All Signs within the development shall be consistent with the Uniform Sign Program as the adopted program establishes the Sign standards for the development. The message substitution policy of this chapter shall be deemed incorporated in every Sign program, even if the Sign program documents do not explicitly so state. Maximum size, location, height, setback, and other development standards for Signs in the Uniform Sign Program shall be consistent with the standards of this chapter. 
E.  Approving Authority. The designated approving authorities for Sign permits, Uniform Sign Programs, Gateways Signs, Business District Signs and Temporary Promotional Signs are listed in Table 18.50-1. 
1.  Each row of the table lists a specific Sign permit by Sign type. Each of the designated approving authorities is listed in a column. The symbol in the cell where the rows and columns meet identifies whether the Approval authority listed in that column is a recommending body, final decision body, or elevated final decision body for that permit type. For instance, the table identifies the Development Services Director as the final decision body and the Planning Commission as the elevated final decision body for Sign permit-building attached Signs. 
2.  Typically, the final decision body is the designated approving authority for the listed permit; however the approving authority may, if the designated approving authority determines that the proposed signage is of significant public interest, elevate the Approval to the next hearing body as listed in the table. 
3.  The approving authority shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed Sign permit Application in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

18.50.080 - General development, maintenance, and removal provisions. 
A.  Construction of Signs. Every Sign and all parts, portions and materials shall be manufactured, assembled, and erected in compliance with all applicable state, federal and City regulations, including the City's adoption of the California Building Code. 
B.  Maintenance of Signs. Every Sign and all parts, portions and materials shall be maintained and kept in proper repair and condition as approved by Sign permit. The display surface of all Signs shall be kept clean, neatly painted, and free from rust, corrosion, damage, and graffiti. Damage and graffiti will be repaired, replaced, recovered, refaced, or repainted with color matching paint and materials so as to produce the appearance that graffiti or damage never existed. Any cracked, broken surfaces, malfunctioning lights, missing Sign Copy, or other non-maintained, damaged, or graffiti portions of a Sign shall be repaired or replaced within thirty days following notification by the City. Noncompliance with such a request will constitute a nuisance condition and zoning violation and will be enforced as such. 
C.  Determination and Measurement of Sign Area. 
1.  General Area Calculation. Generally, the area of a Sign shall be measured as the overall length of the Sign times the overall height of each segment of Copy or Logo. When the Sign is composed of individual letters applied to the building without a distinctive background (e.g., channel letters), the area of the Sign shall be measured as seventy-five percent of the area of the Sign Copy (height of the letters times the length of each line of letters, e.g., length × height × seventy-five percent). 
2.  Awning or Canopy Signs. Sign Copy which is applied to an awning or canopy shall be computed at one hundred percent of the area within a single rectangle enveloping the Sign Copy. 
3.  Freestanding Signs. Freestanding Signs are to be computed as total height by the total length of the Sign or Signs which contain Sign Copy, excluding structure framework (e.g., post or column). The base of a freestanding Sign is not part of the Sign when of wood or masonry. 
a.  For double sided freestanding Signs, only one side of the Sign shall be used to make the calculation. 
b.  For three-sided Signs, only the side with the largest Sign area shall be used to make the calculation. 
c.  For four-sided Signs, the area shall be calculated by the greatest distance between the area of two sides. 
D.  Measurement of Sign Height. Sign height shall be measured from the upper most part of the Sign used in determining the area of the Sign to the lowest elevation at the base of the Sign. For freestanding Signs, the Sign structure may project above the upper most part of the Sign used in determining the area of the Sign by a maximum of ten percent of the Sign height. 
E.  Setback and Spacing of Freestanding Signs. 
1.  The minimum setback distance for freestanding Signs shall be measured from back of the public right-of-way or side of a driveway, unless an encroachment permit is granted. All freestanding Signs shall be located outside of the public right-of-way at least three feet from any property line and any required clear vision triangle. 
2.  The minimum spacing distance between permanent freestanding Signs, excluding on-premises directory Signs, should be fifty feet, including distance from Signs on other properties. The designated approving authority will review the proposed location on a case-by-case basis to ensure the Sign is located outside the required clear vision triangle and does not otherwise inhibit motorist safety. 
F.  Sign Removal or Replacement. A Sign that consists of a can or panel shall be provided with a solid white opaque covering or other method acceptable to the Director within thirty days following cessation of the business which uses the Sign. When a Sign is removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other structural elements that support the Sign shall also be removed. Affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the adjacent portion of the structure. This provision does not apply to routine maintenance. 
(Ord. No. O-03-17, § 2, 4-4-2017)  
18.50.090 - Design standards. 
The following criteria shall be utilized for permanent advertising displays and Signs, and shall not be construed to govern the design of temporary promotional or Political Signs. 
A.  General Design Standards for onsite signs. 
1.  Architectural Style. Each Sign shall be designed to be compatible with and relate to the architectural style of the main building or buildings upon the site where such Sign is located. Each Sign shall also be compatible with the style and character of the existing improvements upon the lots adjacent to the site. Signs located on commercial sites but in a predominately residential area shall be designed to be compatible with such residential area and unobtrusive. 
2.  Relationship to Buildings. Signs located upon a lot with one main building or several buildings shall be designed to incorporate at least one of the predominant visual elements of such building or buildings, such as type of construction materials, color, or other design detail. 
3.  Color. The color(s) of a Sign should be harmonious and complementary to the colors of the building on or near which it is to be located. Fewer colors will generally produce the most attractive Sign. 
4.  Letter Style. The letter style to be used on a Sign should also be compatible with the architectural style of the building. For example, simple block letters are generally most compatible with the Spanish style buildings. For those buildings that have been recently constructed and having no particular architectural style, simpler letter styles are desirable. 
5.  Sign Materials. The goal of Sign design is to maintain moderate, attractive, and compatible styling so as not to conflict or distract from the architectural character of the area. The choice of materials shall be left to the discretion of the applicant, subject to the recommendations of the Development Services Director, the provisions of this chapter and the approval of the City. 
6.  Relationship to Other Signs. Where there is more than one Sign on a site or building, all permanent Signs displaying a Commercial Message shall have designs that similarly treat or incorporate the following design elements: 
a.  Letter size and style of Copy; 
b.  Shape of total Sign and related components; 
c.  Type of construction materials; 
d.  Sign/letter color and style of Copy; 
e.  Method used for supporting Sign (e.g., wall or ground base); and 
f.  Location. 
7.  Sign Illumination. The artificial illumination of Signs, either from an internal or external source, shall be designed to minimize negative impacts on surrounding rights-of-way and properties. The following standards shall apply to all illuminated Signs: 
a.  External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of an object other than the Sign; 
b.  The light from an illuminated Sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will create glare or other negative impact on residential properties in direct line of sight to the Sign; 
c.  Unless otherwise permitted by another provision of this chapter, Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness, or color notwithstanding electronic changeable copy ("digital") signs, which are regulated by Section 18.050.090B.4.ac; 
d.  Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or constructed as traffic control devices; 
e.  Reflective type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed fifteen watts shall not be used on the exterior surface of Signs so that the face of the bulb or lamp is exposed to a public right-of-way or adjacent property; and 
f.  Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible and shall comply with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (California Building Standards Code). 
8.  For increased readability, the City encourages the use of light or translucent Sign Copy on dark and non-translucent background or Sign Field. 
9.  The maximum coverage of Copy allowed on a Sign shall be eighty percent of the Sign Face. 
B.  Design Standards for Special Sign Types. 
1.  Awning and Canopy Signs. Awning and Canopy Signs may be permitted only as an integral part of the awning or canopy to which they are attached or applied, as follows: 
a.  Lettering shall be allowed on awning valances only and shall not exceed eight inches in height. Logos, symbols, and Graphics that do not include text may be allowed on the shed (slope) portion of an awning and shall not exceed four square feet in area for each awning. See Figure 18.50-4 (Awning and Canopy Sign). 
Figure 18.50-4: Awning and Canopy Sign 
 
b.  Lettering shall be located within the middle seventy percent of the valance area. 
c.  Only permanent Signs that are an integral part of the awning or architectural projection shall be allowed. Temporary Signs shall not be placed on awnings. 
d.  Awning Signs shall only be allowed for first and second story occupancies. 
e.  Awnings shall not be lighted from under the awning (back-lit) so that the awning appears internally illuminated. Lighting directed downwards that does not illuminate the awning is allowed. 
f.  Awnings shall be regularly cleaned and kept free of dust and visible defects. 
g.  The style of the awning/canopy shall complement the architectural style of the building to which it is attached. Awnings should generally have a simple horizontal valance if located over rectangular or square window/door openings. Domed or barrel shaped awnings are appropriate for buildings with arched window/door openings. 
2.  Blade/Bracket Signs. 
a.  Location. Blade or bracket Signs shall be placed only on ground floor facades, except for businesses located above the ground level with direct exterior pedestrian access. 
b.  Height. The lowest point of a blade or bracket Sign shall be a minimum of eight feet above grade. 
c.  Projection. The Sign may project a maximum of four feet from the building. 
d.  Sign Structure. Sign supports and brackets shall be compatible with the design and scale of the Sign. 
e.  Encroachment. Blade or bracket Signs may not encroach into the public right-of-way or be located above it, or into City-owned property. 
3.  Building Attached Wall Signs. 
a.  Wall Signs shall be compatible with the predominant visual architectural elements of the building facade. 
b.  Place Wall Signs to establish facade rhythm, scale, and proportion where such elements are weak. In many existing buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, Signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. 
c.  Utilize a consistent proportion of signage to building scale, such as one-third text to two-thirds wall area or one-fourth text to three-fourths wall area. See Figure 18.50-5 (Text Scale). Parapet roof or mansard Roof Signs may be allowed with review and approval by the Director of Development Services only if building does not provide adequate surface area for Wall Signs. 
Figure 18.50-5: Text Scale 
 
d.  Wall Sign raceways shall be concealed from public view (e.g., within the building wall or painted to match the exterior color of the building where the Sign is located) or otherwise integrated with the design of the Sign and building so as to not detract from the architectural character of the building. 
e.  Direct and indirect lighting methods are allowed provided that they are not harsh or unnecessarily bright. Light shall either be directed down or in such a way that it does not cause light trespass or glare onto adjoining property or the public right-of-way. 
f.  Panel signs either within Can-type Signs or within frames are prohibited, except where the Development Services Director finds that such a sign will not detract from other signs on the property or on surrounding area, and that sign anchoring and installation can comply with the California Building Code. Channel letters are preferred. Channel letters shall be made of a durable material. Channel letters may not utilize gold-colored (or a shade of gold) trim cap. 
g.  If a tenant's signage on one facade is made up of multiple elements (e.g., Logo and text), locate, and scale the elements with relationship to each other. See Figure 18.50-6 (Multiple Element Signs). 
Figure 18.50-6: Multiple Element Signs 
 
4.  Electronic changeable Copy Signs. 
a.  Electronic changeable Copy Signs shall be permitted as part of a freestanding Sign located along a freeway right-of-way or a major arterial, as defined by the General Plan Mobility Element, or on the site of a public facilities, educational facilities, or other civic institutions, including religious uses integrated within the design of the freestanding Sign. 
b.  The changeable Copy of Signs within six hundred sixty feet of a freeway centerline shall not change more than once every six seconds. 
c.  The changeable Copy of Signs not within six hundred sixty feet of a freeway centerline shall not change more than once every thirty seconds. 
d.  Time and temperature display, of at least six seconds, shall be required to appear during every two minutes of operation. 
e.  Public service messages shall be accommodated at no additional charge, and may constitute ten percent of the messages displayed during each one-hour period. These public service messages are in addition to the required time and temperature displays. The City shall have authority to review and approve public service messages. 
f.  Electronic changeable Copy Signs shall automatically adjust the brightness of illumination between night and day. 
g.  Electronic changeable Copy Signs may not identify commercial uses/contain Commercial Message for uses not located on the same site as the Sign, unless they are Gateway Signs or Business District Signs, for which different standards apply. 
5.  Freestanding Signs. 
a.  Monument and Pylon Signs are allowed, subject to setback and spacing requirements in Section 18.50.080.E., because they can be more fully integrated in to the overall development design. Pole Signs are specifically prohibited. Pylon Signs shall be constructed with architectural cladding or similar material covering the supporting framework so they are architecturally integrated with the rest of the Sign. 
b.  Voids between the Sign Face and the Sign structure are prohibited. Either the Sign Face shall utilize the full width of the Sign structure or coverings that are architecturally consistent with the rest of the Sign shall be used to fill any voids. The intent is to have the Sign be fully architecturally integrated. 
c.  Materials and design for freestanding Signs shall be complementary to the materials and design of the buildings for the related development. For example, if the facade of the building is made of brick or brick veneer, a complementary freestanding Sign would also include brick. 
d.  Landscaping shall be provided at the base of the Sign equal to the area of the Sign, except for freeway-oriented freestanding Signs, Gateway Signs and Business District Signs. Landscaping shall be complementary to and designed in concert with the landscaping for the overall site. The design of the landscaping shall be such that natural growth will not obscure the Sign from the public right-of-way. 
e.  The minimum letter height on a freestanding Sign shall be ten inches. For freeway-oriented freestanding Signs, Gateway Signs and Business District Signs, the minimum letter height shall be eighteen inches. The intent is to limit the clutter of text on the Sign and increase readability for the motoring public, thereby providing for public safety. Monument and Pylon Signs shall contain the main address number or range of numbers of the site in minimum eight-inch high letters and this area shall not be counted towards the maximum Sign area. Deviations from letter height requirements may be approved through a Uniform Sign Program by the Planning Commission. 
f.  The maximum letter height on a freestanding Sign shall be thirty-two inches. For freeway freestanding Signs the maximum letter height shall be forty-eight inches. The intent is to limit the negative visual impact of large text size. 
g.  Freeway-oriented freestanding Signs, Gateway Signs and Business District Signs shall include City identification Copy consisting of the text "City of Colton" with letter height proportional to overall Sign size, or otherwise identify "Colton" on the Sign. The intent is to help identify the site as being located within the City of Colton. The City identification Copy shall not be counted towards the total Sign area and shall be exempted from the height maximum. The City identification Copy shall be illuminated at night. This requirement may be waived by the approving authority, at its discretion, if it is determined that City identification of adequate size is provided on other Signs within four hundred fifty feet of the proposed Sign. 
6.  Changeable Copy Sign, non-electronic. These types of Signs shall be considered to be the same as any other type of Sign and shall be regulated by their location, i.e., if located on a wall, they shall be deemed Wall Signs and the changeable Copy portion shall not exceed more than one-half the proposed Sign area. 
7.  Menu Board. One single-face freestanding or Wall Sign oriented towards an approved drive-through lane containing menu or other list of products with a maximum Sign area of thirty-two square feet and maximum height of six feet.
