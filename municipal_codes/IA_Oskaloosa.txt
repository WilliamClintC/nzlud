OSKALOOSA, IOWA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Oskaloosa, Iowa 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Oskaloosa, Iowa Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1986, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Scott Campbell, city attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through
Ordinance 1419, passed March 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. __, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

Chapter 8.28 - STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY 

8.28.010 - Purpose and findings. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish the stormwater drainage utility, authorize charges, rates and fees for use of, and discharge to, the storm and surface water drainage system; to provide a process for appeals from certain decisions of the city council relating to such charges; and to provide for collection of delinquent charges. 
B.  The city council finds that the construction, operation and maintenance of the city's stormwater system should be funded through user charges imposed for the discharge of storm and surface water to the stormwater drainage system, thereby charging those persons and activities using or receiving service from that system. 
    The city may be required to provide increased quantity or quality controls to mitigate those impacts of pollutants from discharging storm and surface waters into the stormwater system. Therefore, it is appropriate to impose a storm and surface water user charge upon all users of property which may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the stormwater system. 
(Ord. 1245 § 1, 2007) 
8.28.020 - Definitions.

    "Connection" means the physical act or process of directing or allowing the flow of storm and surface waters to the storm sewer or drainage line, or joining onto a private storm sewer, for the purpose of connecting private impervious surface or other storm and surface water sources or systems to the public storm and surface water system. It shall also include creation or maintenance of impervious surface that causes or is likely to cause an increase in the quantity or decrease the quality or both from the natural state of stormwater runoff, and which drains, directly or indirectly, to the storm and surface water system. 
    "Council" means the city council of Oskaloosa, Iowa. 
    "Date of imposition" or "imposition date" means the date designated by the council at which time a charge is imposed and becomes the legal obligation of the user. The obligation may include the cost of services to be provided during the billing period or for services previously provided to the same person under this chapter. 
    "Days" means calendar days unless otherwise specified. 
    "Equivalent residential unit" or "ERU" means a measurement unit based on the impervious surface area of an average improved single-family dwelling lot or parcel within the city (as determined by a statistical sampling performed by the city). Except as provided in Section 8.28.060, one equivalent residential unit shall be deemed to be two thousand seven hundred fifty square feet of impervious material. See "Section 8.28.060, Flat Rate Uses" for further clarification. 
    "Impervious surface area" means all land area that has been altered from its natural state such that it does not allow the infiltration and retention of water equivalent to that of undisturbed soil. This shall include, but is not limited to: pavement, buildings, decks, parking areas, and compacted gravel areas. Impervious surface shall not include improved streets, roads and sidewalks within the public right-of-way and private streets in residentially zoned areas of the city. Rather such facilities are deemed to be part of the public surface water drainage conveyance system. 
    "Occupant" means the person residing or doing business on the property.

(Ord. 1245 § 2, 2007) 
8.28.030 - Stormwater utility established. 
    Pursuant to the authority of Section 384.84, The Iowa Code, as amended, the city council establishes a stormwater utility in the city. The entire city, as increased from time to time, shall constitute a single storm and surface water drainage system district. 
(Ord. 1245 § 3, 2007) 
8.28.040 - Charges and fees in general. 
    The council may adopt by rule, charges, rates and fees for use of the city's storm and surface water system, and for services provided by the city relating to that system. Such rules may include delinquency and interest charges and penalties. Such charges and fees shall be based upon the costs of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and replacement of the city's system, the costs of bond repayment, regulation, administration, and services of the city. All billing procedures shall be the same as for water usage and may be billed on the same bill. All charges collected under this chapter shall be deposited into the "stormwater utility fund," and shall be used only for the cost of operation, maintenance, acquisition, extension and replacement of the city's system, costs of bond issuance and repayment and administration related to the storm and surface water drainage system. 
(Ord. 1251 § 2, 2007) 
8.28.050 - Stormwater utility user charge. 
A.  There is established a stormwater utility system user charge. The charge due for the billing period shall be the obligation of the user of the public storm system on the imposition date, notwithstanding whether the user is the addressee of the bill. 
B.  The charge shall be the personal obligation of the user on the imposition date, regardless of whether that person has any ownership interest in the property. This charge shall constitute a debt due the city as of the date of imposition. 
C.  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the real property, as shown in the records of the county assessor, is the occupant. 
D.  The stormwater utility user charge shall be imposed upon any person who uses or discharges to the public storm and surface water drainage system by: 
1.  Maintaining impervious surface connected to (directly or indirectly) and capable of discharge to the public surface water management systems; or 
2.  Actually discharging storm or surface water into the system. 
E.  Said charge shall be charged for all users of properties within the boundaries of the city except property owned by the city of Oskaloosa. A property containing impervious surface, is presumed to discharge stormwater to the storm and surface water drainage system, and to generate a demand for storm and surface water drainage services unless that property has an on-site disposal system which meets the standard of Section 8.28.060(A)(8) of this chapter and any rules adopted thereunder. 
(Ord. 1251 §§ 4, 7-9, 2007; Ord. 1245 § 5, 2007) 
8.28.060 - Calculation of equivalent residential units and amount of charge. 
A.  This subsection shall be used to determine the number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) for a property for purposes of determining the amount of stormwater utility (SWU) service charges and the water quantity component of the SWU. There are two types of uses: flat rate uses and measured uses. These are defined as follows: 
1.  "Flat Rate" Uses. Improved properties that qualify under this section as flat rate uses shall be charged at the rate of one ERU per dwelling unit. The following uses shall be defined as "flat rate" uses: 
a.  Single-Family Residence. A residential structure not attached to another residential structure on one or more parcels of land, providing there are not more than two residential structures on one parcel. This definition also includes trailers, mobile homes, and manufactured homes, if on separate parcels. Two separate dwelling units on a single parcel shall be charged one ERU per dwelling unit. 
    Three or more residential dwelling units on one parcel, whether attached or unattached, shall be considered a multiple-family residential use. 
b.  Duplex. Two dwelling units joined to each other with a common wall, or one above the other, on one or two parcels. The units may be under one ownership, or owned separately. Each dwelling unit of the duplex shall be charged one ERU. 
c.  Multi-Family Residential Use. Three or more dwelling units joined to each other horizontally or vertically, on one or more parcels. The units may be under one ownership or more. Each dwelling unit shall be charged one ERU. The owner of the taxed land parcel shall be deemed the user; except where multi-family dwelling units are individually metered the occupant of each unit is deemed the user and shall be charged one ERU. 
d.  Condominiums. Each living unit of a condominium shall be charged one ERU. Unit is defined as living units and do not include supporting uses, such as garages, even though they may be on separate parcels. 
e.  Mobile Home Parks. Includes mobile homes on a single tax lot (even if there are more than two per tax lot) under one ownership, where spaces are leased or rented for a mobile home or trailer to be placed. Each space in a mobile home park shall be charged one ERU whether or not there is a mobile home on the space. Other impervious areas contained within the boundaries of the mobile home park shall not be measured. The owner of a taxed lot shall be deemed the user. 
2.  Measured Uses. Properties that are not flat rate uses shall be measured uses. For such uses, the impervious surfaces of the property, as defined by rule, shall be measured. The area shall be estimated using one or more of the following: aerial photographs, assessment records, building permits, construction plans, site visits, ad valorem property tax records, storm and surface water system connection permits, field surveys or other sources deemed reliable by the city connection permits, field surveys or other sources deemed reliable by the city. 
    This area shall then be divided by two thousand seven hundred fifty square feet of one equivalent residential unit within the city. The ERU for all of the uses in this subsection shall be determined by measuring the impervious area. All values shall be rounded to the next lowest whole number, but not less than one ERU. 
a.  Commercial, Industrial, Institutional. These categories include the entire range of office, manufacturing service, sales, restaurant, daycare, nursery, warehouse, churches, schools, utilities, public service buildings, parks, hospital, nursing home, rest home, retirement home, and other similar uses. This category includes land with an impervious surface with no building improvements. 
3.  General Policies. 
a.  No Limit on Charge for a Measured Use. If a use is a measured use, its charge shall not be limited. 
b.  Minimum Charge. The minimum charge for any parcel with impervious areas subject to the SWU charge shall be one ERU. 
c.  Limited Charge. Notwithstanding subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section, governmental properties and cemeteries shall be charged a maximum of fifty dollars per location per month. For purposes of this chapter, governmental properties shall be defined as that owned property owned by either Mahaska County or the Oskaloosa School District only. 
d.  Community Facilities. The flat rate category includes typical residential uses within a parcel or single ownership, as defined above. If a community or neighborhood recreation center or similar facility exists within a subdivision, even if associated with the single-family or duplex properties, that property shall be measured and charged separately to the user of that property. 
e.  Seasonal Impervious Area. Properties which have areas that are impervious for only a portion of the year shall constitute seasonal impervious area. If an impervious area is in place for more than three months per year, it shall be subject to the SWU charge. 
f.  Miscellaneous. 
i.  No credits, exemptions, or reductions shall be given for impervious surfaces that are submerged for a portion of the year. 
ii.  If impervious areas are so small they cannot be detected on aerial maps at a scale of one inch to fifty feet, then they shall not be included in the total impervious area. 
iii.  A residence of any kind and a garage for that residence shall be charged one ERU, even if on two adjacent parcels. 
iv.  In-ground swimming pools are exempted from SWU fees providing the filter drains are connected to the sanitary sewer system. Above ground swimming pools are exempt from SWU fees. 
v.  Impervious areas are subject to the SWU fee regardless of the percentage of the entire property occupied by the impervious area. 
vi.  The city may elect not to bill small measured use properties when the administrative cost of the billing exceeds the revenue generated. 
4.  Roads. Public roads and private roads in residentially zoned areas of the city shall not be included in the measurement of impervious surface areas. 
5.  Parking and Storage Areas. 
a.  All parking and vehicle storage areas that are gravel or paved on a measured use parcel shall be considered impervious and subject to the SWU fee. 
b.  All parking and vehicle storage areas part of a flat rate use parcel shall be considered a part of the impervious area of the flat rate use parcel. 
6.  Railroad Facilities. Railroad facilities shall be included in the measurement of impervious area, but the rail grade itself shall be excluded as being pervious. 
7.  Landscaping Exempted. Gravel areas that are used for landscaping or foot traffic and are not considered highly compacted shall not be considered impervious for purposes of determining the SWU fee. 
8.  Exemption from SWU Service Charges. 
a.  Users of properties for which all stormwater is disposed of on-site, as defined by city standards, may request an exemption from SWU service charges. No partial exemptions for disposal of only a portion of the storm and surface waters on-site shall be allowed. In order to qualify for service charge exemption, the user must design, construct and maintain an on-site facility that keeps all storm and surface water for the full range of storms during the year. This applicant for exemption must pay an initial inspection/review fee. For the purpose of this section, the term "property" means a parcel of land, or a group of adjacent parcels working in cooperation. The term "on-site disposal" means on the parcel, or on another parcel in the near vicinity of the parcel requesting the exemption. 
    In order to qualify for the exemption, the on-site system must encompass the entire property (except for incidental impervious areas as defined below), must be completely separated from the public system, and must provide adequate on-site disposal. Incidental area such as sidewalks, decks, and driveway aprons, shall not exceed ten percent of the total impervious area. 
    On-site disposal facilities that may qualify are dry wells, injection wells, retention basins with percolation/evaporation capacity, and retention basins with capacity large enough to accommodate the total of all storms through the year. Many of these may have a possible adverse effect on ground water, and some techniques may require approval of state, federal and local agencies. 
b.  To qualify, an applicant must submit a request to the city for a waiver of monthly service charges relating to the property. This request shall include a certification from an engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the city, that shows the system is separate and will dispose of the full range and volume of stormwater through the year on-site. The applicant shall also submit a maintenance plan for assuring the system will function as designed. The application must be signed by the property owner. 
    An inspection/review fee shall be paid at the time of application. If the application is denied, the inspection/review fee will be credited to the service charges due. If the request for the waiver is made as part of the construction plans, this fee shall be waived. 
    A decision denying an exemption may be appealed. If approved, the waiver will be effective for the next billing cycle. 
c.  The city retains the right to inspect the on-site measures to assure they are functioning as designed. If at any time the measures are found to not be effective, the exemption shall cease. 
d.  "Conservation design credit" to recognize the reduction in stormwater runoff related to certain conservation design practices, the impervious area of facilities that are in accordance with approved conservation design practices will be reduced by a percentage of the total impervious area of that facility. The reduction is based on the impervious area subject to the conservation design practice and does not include a reduction of the total site impervious area or the impervious area of facilities that do not include conservation design practices. The maximum credit provided for any impervious area is the largest credit of applicable individual conservation design practices and a cumulative reduction is not allowed. 
    The reduction of the impervious area of facilities subject to conservation design practices is: 
1. Green roof design 65% reduction 2. Porous pavement 50% reduction* 3. Rain gardens, bioswales and similar facilities 50% reduction  
* The reduction for porous pavement shall be valid for a period of five years. The city will inspect the porous pavement every five years and determine if the porous pavement continues to maintain the high porosity associated with porous pavement design. If the high porosity continues, the credit will be renewed for a period of five years. If the porosity has been decreased due to plugging or fouling, the credit will not be renewed. 
B.  Rates. The rate for the service charge shall be two dollars per ERU. Said rates shall be established by council based upon estimated stormwater utility system actual costs. Said rates shall be periodically reviewed by the city council. 
    The estimated stormwater utility system actual costs may include funds that are budgeted for accumulation for future capital improvement projects even though said funds may not be expended during the fiscal year in which the revenue is budgeted for collection. 
C.  Records. All ERU records for all properties within the city of Oskaloosa shall be kept on file in the city clerk's office and shall be available during normal office hours for examination. 
D.  Deposit. All users of the stormwater utility may be subject to the provisions for utility deposit if established by rule of council. 
(Ord. 1251 § 11, 2007; Ord. 1245 § 6, 2007) 
8.28.070 - Billing. 
A.  The city shall send a bill for the amount due by regular mail to every user in the city. Mailing to the owner of record as shown in the assessor records or to the occupant with a water account, as determined appropriate by the city, shall satisfy this requirement. The billing period shall be on the basis of a calendar month period. The bill may be made part of the regular billing for a water account or a separate billing as determined by the city. If the billing is made part of the regular billing for a water account, the billing shall be included in the regular water billing issued at the end of the calendar month during which the billing cycle closes and shall be monthly or quarterly as determined by the billing cycle of the water billing. 
B.  The recipient of the first billing after the imposition has twenty days after receipt of the first billing to notify the city of Oskaloosa the recipient is not the responsible party and to provide information on the relationship of the recipient to the property and the occupant of the property as of the imposition date.

Chapter 9.24 - OFFENSES BY OR AGAINST MINORS 
Sections: 

9.24.010 - Curfew-Purpose. 
    The city council determines that a curfew for minors is necessary to promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city and specifically to achieve the following purposes: 
A.  Reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of adults responsible for minors; 
B.  Protect the public from illegal acts of minors committed individually and in groups after the curfew hour; and 
C.  Protect minors from improper influences and criminal activity by individuals that prevail in public places after the curfew hour.

    "Knowingly" means knowledge which a responsible adult should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that responsible adult's custody. It is intended to continue to hold the neglectful or careless adult responsible for a minor to a reasonable community standard of adult responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense that an adult responsible for a minor was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of that minor. 
    "Minor" means any unemancipated person under the age of eighteen years. 
    "Public place" means and includes shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, streets, alleys, sidewalks dedicated to public use; and it shall also include such parts of buildings and other premises whether publicly or privately owned which are used by the general public or to which the general public is invited commercially for a fee or otherwise; or in or on which the general public is permitted without specific invitation; or to which the general public has access. For the purposes of this chapter, a vehicle or other conveyance is considered to be a public place when in the areas defined above. 
    "Responsible adult" means a parent, guardian or other adult specifically authorized by law, or authorized by a parent or guardian to have custody or control of a minor. 
    "Unemancipated" means unmarried and still under custody or control of a responsible adult. 
(Ord. 906 §2, 1993) 
9.24.030 - Curfew-Time limits. 
    It is unlawful for any minor to be or remain upon any of the alleys, streets or public places or places of business and amusement in the city between the hours of twelve midnight and six a.m. of the following day.

1.  The minor's place of employment in a business, trade or occupation, which the minor is permitted by law to be employed or, if traveling, within one-half hour of the end of work;

6.  The minor is on an emergency errand for a responsible adult; 
7.  The minor is engaged in interstate travel through the city of beginning, ending or passing through Oskaloosa when said travel is by direct route. 
(Ord. 906 §3, 1993) 
9.24.050 - Curfew-Adult responsibility. 
    It is unlawful for any adult knowingly to permit or to allow a minor to be in any public place in the city within the time periods prohibited by this chapter, unless the minor's presence falls within one of the above exceptions. 
(Ord. 906 §4, 1993) 
9.24.060 - Curfew-Responsibility of business establishments. 
    It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation operating a place of business or amusement to allow or permit any minor to be in or upon any place of business or amusement operated by them within the curfew hours set by Section 9.24.030, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.24.040. 
(Prior code §2.1-1.0301(5)) 
9.24.070 - Curfew-Enforcement. 
    Any peace officer of this city while on duty is empowered to arrest any minor who violates any of the provisions of Sections 9.24.030 and 9.24.040. Upon arrest, the minor shall be returned to the custody of the parent, guardian or other person charged with the care and custody of the minor.

If the city has a reasonable alternative route for the street, alley or public improvements or an alternative construction method, which would not cause the relocation of the company installations, the city shall select said alternative route, or construction method. The city shall be responsible for surveying and staking the right-of-way for city projects that require the company to relocate company facilities. If requested the city shall provide, at no cost to the company, copies of its relocation plan and profile and cross section drawings.

13.20.730 - Enforcement. 
    Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event the franchising authority, after such public hearing, determines that the grantee is in default of any provision of the franchise, the franchising authority may: 
A.  Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages; 
B.  Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief; or

    The franchising authority shall give written notice to the grantee of its intent to revoke the franchise on the basis of noncompliance by the grantee, including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a material provision of the franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact nature of the noncompliance. The grantee shall have ninety days from such notice to object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the franchising authority has not received a response satisfactory from the grantee, it may then seek termination of the franchise at a public meeting. The franchising authority shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least ten days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such termination. 
    At the designated meeting, the franchising authority shall give the grantee an opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine whether or not the franchise shall be revoked. The grantee may appeal such determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the decision of the franchising authority "de novo" and to modify or reverse such decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be taken within sixty days of the issuance of the determination of the franchising authority. 
    The franchising authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action which it deems appropriate to enforce the franchising authority's rights under the franchise in lieu of revocation of the franchise.

    A grantee shall not be held in default under or in noncompliance with the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the franchise), where such noncompliance or alleged defaults are caused by circumstances reasonably beyond its control including, but not limited, to strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storms, hurricane, tornado, or other catastrophic acts of nature, labor disputes, governmental, administrative or judicial or regulation. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the grantee's cable and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or labor to perform the work necessary.

2.  If a petition is filed by or against the grantee under the Bankruptcy Act or any other insolvency or creditors' rights law, state or federal, and the grantee shall fail to have it dismissed. 
3.  If a receiver, trustee or liquidator of the grantee is applied for or appointed for all or part of the grantee's assets. 
4.  If the grantee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors. 
5.  If the grantee violates any lawful order or ruling of any state or federal regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee, unless the grantee or any party similarly affected is lawfully contesting the legality or applicability of such order or ruling and has received a stay from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
6.  If the grantee evades any of the lawful provisions of this chapter or the franchise agreement. 
7.  If the grantee practices any intentional fraud or deceit upon the grantor or cable subscribers. 
8.  If the grantee materially misrepresents facts in the application for a franchise. 
9.  If the grantee ceases to provide services over the cable system for seven consecutive days for any reason within the control of the grantee. 
B.  Restoration of Property. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill at its own expense any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to the grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances, without affecting the electric or telephone cables, wires or attachments. The grantor shall inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. Liability insurance indemnity provided in Section 13.20.630 and the performance bond in Section 13.20.780 shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal. 
C.  Reimbursement of Costs Pursuant to Subsections A and B of this Section. In the event of a failure by the grantee to complete any work as required above or any work required by law or ordinance within the time established and to the reasonable satisfaction of the grantor, after due notice and opportunity to curve, the city may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall reimburse the grantor the costs thereof within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the grantor may recover such costs as provided in Section 13.20.770.

13.20.770 - Security fund.

B.  Within ten days after notice that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund deposited pursuant to subsection A of this section, a grantee shall pay to, or deposit with, the city clerk a sum of money sufficient to restore such security fund to the original amount of ten thousand dollars. 
C.  If a grantee fails to pay to the grantor any compensation within the time fixed herein; or fails after ten days notice to pay to the grantor any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay to the grantor within such ten days, any damages, costs, or expenses which the grantor shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of a grantee in connection with the franchise; or fails after three days notice of such failure by the grantor to comply with any provision of the franchise which the grantor reasonably determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the security, the city clerk may immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any penalties, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the city clerk shall notify a grantee of the amount and date thereof. 
D.  The security fund deposited shall become the property of the grantor in the event that the franchise is canceled by reason of the default of the grantee. A grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or portion thereof, as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of a grantee. Interest earned by the investment of the security fund will accrue to a grantee. 
E.  The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the grantor, whether reserved by the franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the grantor may have.

    "Alteration" means any addition or modification of any portion of the exterior of a building, structure, object, site or site feature that changes the architectural style, arrangement, texture, or material of the building or feature or significantly changes the color; if such change, addition, or modification is visible from the public street, sidewalk, alley, or park.

    "Contributing" means any building site, object, and/or structure contained in a designated historic district or National Register of Historic Places historic district, that is identified as a contributor to the historic district. 
    "Cultural resource" means any building, site, structure, object, or district which may have significance in history or pre-history. 
    "Demolition" of a building means the act or process of pulling down, destroying, removing or razing a building or commencing the work of total or substantial destruction. 
    "Design standards and guidelines" means a document that is produced by the city for the purpose of guiding review of proposed alterations to designated historic landmarks and historic districts. This document establishes criteria for building alterations or new construction, which, if followed, will provide compatible design. 
    "Economic feasibility" refers to the economic impact of preservation measures, generally comparing use of traditional materials versus modern counterparts. For instance, there may be a range of appropriate replacement materials listed, with preference given to traditional materials. In some cases, traditional materials may be more expensive or not readily available, lowering the economic feasibility of using the preferred, traditional materials. 
    "Economic hardship" refers to the economic impact of preservation requirements that would deprive a property owner of all reasonable economic use or return on a property. See Section 15.50.180. 
    "Historic district" means a significant concentration, linkage or continuity of sites, buildings, structures or objects united historically by plan or physical development. This area must contain contiguous pieces of property under diverse ownership which meets one or more of the historic significance criteria and has been officially designated by the city through the passage of an ordinance. 
    "Historic landmark" is a building, structure, site or object that meets one or more of the Historic Significance Criteria and has been officially designated through passage of an ordinance. 
    "Historic Significance Criteria" applies to the quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture that is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and: 
1.  That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; 
2.  That are associated with the lives of significant persons in the past; 
3.  That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
4.  That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in history or prehistory. 
    "Improvement" means any structure, place, work of art, landscape element, or other object constituting a physical betterment of real property which is visible from a public way or adjoining properties. 
    "Majority" means a simple majority consisting of one over half of the members present and voting if a quorum is established.

    "Non-contributing structure" means any structure which does not contribute to the historic character of a district that is identified as such in an officially adopted historic district or National Register listed district. 
    "Object" is used to distinguish from buildings and structures those constructions that are primarily artistic in nature or are relatively small in scale and simply constructed. Although it may be, by nature or design, moveable, an object is associated with a specific setting or environment. 
    "Ordinary maintenance and repair" means any work where the purpose and effect of such work is to correct any deterioration or decay of or damage to a structure or any part thereof and to restore the same, as nearly as may be practicable, to its condition prior to the occurrence of such deterioration, decay, or damage. 
    "Preservation" is defined as the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity and materials of an historic property. Work, including preliminary measures to protect and stabilize the property, generally focuses upon the ongoing maintenance and repair of historic materials and features rather than extensive replacement and new construction. New exterior additions are not within the scope of this treatment; however, the limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a preservation project. 
    "Preservation commission" means the Oskaloosa Historic Preservation Commission, as established by this chapter. 
    "Property inventory" means a file of information about buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts in the city, including, but not limited to, completed Iowa Site Inventory forms, National Register of Historic Places Nominations, reports of survey and evaluation projects and contexts developed for the city, officially designated City Landmark and Historic District Nominations and other germane information. 
    "Quorum" means a majority of the membership of the Oskaloosa Historic Preservation Commission. 
    "Significant features" means those elements of a building, structure, object or site or a district that contributes to its historic character and value. 
    "Site" is the location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure. 
    "Site furnishing" refers to objects or elements in the public right-of-way or in public spaces. They are generally small scale elements that may be functional, decorative or both. They can include benches, lights, signs, drinking fountains, trash receptacles, fences, tree grates, clocks, flagpoles, sculpture, monuments, memorials, planters and urns. They may be movable, used seasonally or permanently installed. They occur as singular items, in groups of similar or identical features, or as part of a system (e.g., signage). 
    "Substantial adverse change" means any change in physical appearance to a building which would significantly alter those features which give the building its value as a historic resource.

1.  The anticipated use for the property remains that for which it was originally intended or requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site and its environment for the proposed reuse. 
2.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure, or site and its environment shall not be compromised. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to recreate an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Certain alterations which may have taken place in the course of time are potentially significant to understanding the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its environment. These historic alterations may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be retained. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair and replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  Surface cleaning of historic structures shall be undertaken with methods that will avoid damage to the historic building materials. 
8.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not compromise significant historical, architectural, or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of the property, neighborhood, or environment. 
9.  Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to the structure shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic structure would be unimpaired. 
B.  The commission shall consider the following site development and design issues when applicable to reviewing certificate of appropriateness applications. 
1.  Architectural design; 
2.  Scale and proportion; 
3.  Construction materials; 
4.  Method of construction; 
5.  Grading; 
6.  Site development; 
7.  Orientation of buildings; 
8.  Off-street parking; 
9.  Landscaping; 
10.  Signs; 
11.  Street furniture; 
12.  Public areas; 
13.  Relationship of the project to its surroundings.

f.  The fair market value of the property immediately prior to its designation as a landmark site and the fair market value of the property as a landmark site at the time the application is filed; 
g.  Form of ownership or operation of the property, i.e., sole proprietorship, for-profit corporation or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, etc.; and 
h.  Any state or federal income tax returns on or relating to the property for the previous two years.

b.  Reasonableness of the price or rent sought by the applicant, and 
c.  Any advertisements placed for the sale or rent of the property.

c.  Estimated market value of the property in the current condition after completion of the demolition and proposed new construction, and after renovation of the existing property for continued use; and 
d.  The testimony of an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser, or other professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. 
5.  Economic incentives and/or funding available to the applicant through federal, state, city, or private programs. 
C.  Procedure for Determination of Economic Hardship. The preservation commission may establish a three-person economic review panel. If such a review panel is established it shall adhere to the following procedures. This panel shall be comprised of three real estate and redevelopment experts knowledgeable in real estate economics in general, and more specifically, in the economics of renovation, redevelopment and other aspects of rehabilitation. The panel shall consist of one person selected by the preservation commission, one person selected by the applicant, and one person selected by the first two appointees. If the first two appointees cannot agree on a third person within thirty days of the date of the initial public hearing, the third appointee shall be selected by the mayor within five days after the expiration of the thirty-day period. 
1.  Review of Evidence. All of the evidence and documentation presented to the preservation commission shall be made available to and reviewed by the economic review panel.

a.  Finding of Economic Hardship: If after reviewing all of the evidence, the preservation commission finds that the application of the standards set forth in subsection B of this section results in economic hardship, then the preservation commission shall issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition. 
b.  Denial of Economic Hardship: If the preservation commission finds that the application of the standards set forth in subsection B of this section does not result in economic hardship, then the certificate of appropriateness for demolition shall be denied. 
c.  Consistency With The Economic Review Panel Report: The preservation commission decision shall be consistent with the conclusions reached by the economic review panel unless, based on all of the evidence and documentation presented to the preservation commission, the preservation commission finds by a vote of three-fourths majority of a quorum present that the economic review panel acted in an arbitrary manner, or that its report was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact.

F.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the building inspector may issue a demolition permit for a significant building at any time after the receipt of written advice from the commission to the effect that either: 
1.  The commission is satisfied that there is no reasonable likelihood that either the owner or some other person or group is willing to purchase, preserve, rehabilitate or restore such building, or 
2.  The commission is satisfied that for at least twelve months the owner has made continuing, bona fide and reasonable efforts to locate a purchaser to preserve, rehabilitate and restore the subject building, and that such efforts have been unsuccessful.

Table 17.08A 
Purposes of Zoning Districts 
  
Symbol Title Purpose AG Agricultural/urban reserve The AG district provides for and preserves the agricultural and rural use of land, while accommodating very low density residential development generally associated with agricultural uses. This district is designed to maintain complete agricultural uses within the Oskaloosa extra-territorial jurisdiction. In addition, land included in the urban reserve in the comprehensive plan should be retained in the AG district to prevent premature or inappropriate development. RR Rural residential This district provides for the rural residential use of land, accommodating very low and low density residential environments. The district's regulations assure that density is developed consistent with: land use polices of the Oskaloosa comprehensive plan regarding rural subdivisions; levels of infrastructure; and environmentally sensitive development practices. The district also accommodates developments that merge urban living with rural life. R-1 Single-family residential This district is intended to provide for residential development, characterized by single-family dwellings on large lots with supporting community facilities and urban services. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure. R-2 Urban family residential This district is intended to provide for medium density residential development, characterized by single-family dwellings on moderately-sized lots along with low density multi-unit residential structures such as duplexes and townhouses. It provides regulations to encourage innovative forms of housing development. It adapts to both established and developing neighborhoods, as well as transitions between single-family and multi-family areas. Its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of infrastructure. R-3 Multiple-family residential This district is intended to provide locations primarily for multiple-family housing, with supporting and appropriate community facilities. It also permits some nonresidential uses such as offices through a special permit procedure to permit a mixing of uses that have relatively similar operating and development effects. R-4 Mobile home residential This district recognizes that mobile home development, properly planned, can provide important opportunities for affordable housing. It provides opportunities for mobile home development within planned parks or subdivisions, along with the supporting services necessary to create quality residential neighborhoods. UC Mixed use urban corridor This district recognizes the mixed use character of major urban corridors, such as A Avenue and Market Street. These corridors sometimes accommodate a combination of residential, commercial, and office uses. Design standards maintain their character as important urban streets. LC Limited commercial/ 
office This district reserves appropriately located area for office development and a limited variety of low-impact commercial facilities which serve the needs of residents of surrounding residential communities. The commercial and office uses permitted are compatible with nearby residential areas. Development regulations are designed to ensure compatibility in size, scale, and landscaping with nearby residences. CC Community commercial This district is intended for commercial facilities which serve the needs of markets ranging from several neighborhoods to the overall region. While allowed commercial and office uses are generally compatible with nearby residential areas, traffic and operating characteristics may have more negative effects on residential neighborhoods than those permitted in the LC district. CC districts are appropriate at major intersections, at the junction of several neighborhoods, or at substantial commercial subcenters. DC Downtown commercial This district is intended to provide appropriate development regulations for downtown Oskaloosa. Mixed uses are encouraged within the DC district. The grouping of uses is designed to strengthen the town center's role as a center for trade, service, and civic life. GC General commercial This district accommodates a variety of commercial uses, some of which have significant traffic or visual effect. These districts may include commercial uses which are oriented to services, including automotive services, rather than retail activities. These uses may create land use conflicts with adjacent residential areas, requiring provision of adequate buffering. This district is most appropriately located along major arterial streets or in areas that can be adequately buffered from residential districts. HC Highway commercial This district is designed to provide high quality commercial development at major community gateways and highway environments, specifically relating to interchanges or intersections of major community arterials such as A Avenue and Market Street with Highway 163. The design of projects at these gateways should provide a positive first impression to Oskaloosa. BP Business park This district is designed to promote the development of planned business parks that accommodate corporate offices, research facilities, and structures which can combine office, distribution, and limited industrial uses. These facilities serve a more regional audience, but may provide services to local residents. They are characterized by extensive landscaping, abundant parking facilities, and good visual and pedestrian relationships among buildings.  
Table 17.08A 
Purposes of Zoning Districts (Continued) 
  
Symbol Title Purpose LI Limited industrial This district is intended to reserve sites appropriate for the location of industrial uses with relatively limited environmental effects. The district is designed to provide appropriate space and regulations to encourage good quality industrial development, while assuring that facilities are served with adequate parking and loading facilities. GI General industrial This district is intended to accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses, some of which may have significant external effects. These uses may have operating characteristics that create conflicts with lower-intensity surrounding land uses. The district provides the reservation of land for these activities and includes buffering requirements to reduce incompatibility.

a.  A boundary survey; 
b.  Site dimensions; 
c.  Contour lines at no greater than five-foot intervals; 
d.  Adjacent public rights-of-way, transportation routes, and pedestrian or bicycle systems; 
e.  Description of adjacent land uses; 
f.  Utility service to the site and easements through the site; 
g.  Description of other site features, including drainage, soils, or other considerations that may affect development. 
2.  A development plan, including: 
a.  A site layout, including the location of proposed buildings, parking, open space, and other facilities; 
b.  Location, capacity, and conceptual design of parking facilities; 
c.  Description of the use of individual buildings; 
d.  Description of all use types to be included in the project or area, and maximum floor area devoted to each general use; 
e.  Maximum height of buildings; 
f.  Schematic location and design of open space on the site, including a landscaping plan; 
g.  Vehicular and pedestrian circulation plan, including relationship to external transportation systems; 
h.  Schematic building elevations and sections if required to describe the project; 
i.  Grading plans; 
j.  Proposed sewer and utility improvements; 
k.  Location, sizes, and types of all proposed signage. 
3.  Specific proposed development regulations for the project, including: 
a.  The specific use types permitted within the proposed district; 
b.  Maximum floor area ratios; 
c.  Front, side, and rear yard setbacks; 
d.  Maximum height; 
e.  Maximum building and impervious coverage; 
f.  Design standards applicable to the project. 
4.  A traffic impact analysis, if required by the city. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.504, 2000) 
17.12.040 - Adoption of district. 
A.  The planning and zoning commission and city council shall review and evaluate each mixed use district application. The city may impose reasonable conditions, as deemed necessary to ensure that a mixed use development shall be compatible with adjacent land uses, will not overburden public services and facilities and will not be detrimental to public health, safety and welfare. 
B.  The planning and zoning commission, after proper notice, shall hold a public hearing and act upon each application. 
C.  The planning and zoning commission may recommend amendments to MU district applications. 
D.  The recommendation of the planning and zoning commission shall be transmitted to the city council for final action. 
E.  The city council, after proper notice, shall hold a public hearing and act upon any ordinance establishing a MU mixed use district. Proper notice shall mean the same notice established for any other zoning amendment. 
F.  An ordinance adopting a mixed use district shall require a favorable simple majority of the city council for approval. 
G.  Upon approval by the city council, the development plan shall become a part of the ordinance creating or amending the MU district. All approved plans shall be filed with the city clerk. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.505, 2000) 
17.12.050 - Amendments. 
    The zoning administrator is authorized at his/her discretion to approve amendments to an approved development plan, provided that: 
A.  A written request is filed with the zoning administrator, along with information specifying the exact nature of the proposed amendment. 
B.  The amendment is consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  The amendment does not alter the approved site regulations of the development plan and does not materially alter other aspects of the plan, including traffic circulation, mixture of use types, and physical design. 
D.  Any amendment not conforming to these provisions shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission and city council for action. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.506, 2000) 
Chapter 17.14 - PUD PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.14.010 - Purpose. 
    The PUD planned unit development overlay district is intended to provide flexibility in the design of planned projects; to permit innovation in project design that incorporates open space and other amenities; and to insure compatibility of developments with the surrounding urban environment. The PUD district may be used in combination with any base district specified in this title. The PUD district, which is adopted by the city council with the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, assures specific development standards for each designated project. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.510, 2000) 
17.14.020 - Permitted uses. 
    Uses permitted in a PUD overlay district are those permitted in the underlying base district. A PUD also may be combined with an MU mixed use district to allow a combination of use types not anticipated by conventional base districts. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.511, 2000) 
17.14.030 - Site development regulations. 
    Site development regulations are developed individually for each planned unit development district, but must comply with the minimum or maximum standards established for the base district, with the following exceptions: 
A.  Lot area and lot width are not restricted, provided that the maximum density allowed for each base district is not exceeded. 
B.  Maximum building coverage shall be the smaller of the allowed building coverage in the base district, or sixty percent. 
C.  Setback requirements may be varied according to the specific planned unit development plan. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.512, 2000) 
17.14.040 - Access to public streets. 
    Each PUD district must abut a public street for at least one hundred feet and gain access from that street. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.513, 2000) 
17.14.050 - Application process.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1370, § 1, adopted Feb. 2, 2015, amended the title of Ch. 17.24 to read as set out herein. Formerly, Ch. 17.24 was titled, "Supplemental Site Development Regulations." 

17.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The supplemental site development regulations establish basic requirements for developable lots, including frontage requirements, recognize the existence of special conditions that cannot comply literally with the site development regulations set out for each zoning district. Therefore, these regulations qualify or modify the district regulations of this title and provide for specific areas of exception. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.701, 2000) 
17.24.020 - Exceptions for existing single-family and two-family dwellings. 
    In any zoning district where they are otherwise permitted, a single-family or two-family dwelling may be located or reconstructed on a lot which, at the time of passage of this ordinance, is non-conforming development in terms of lot area, width, yards, lot coverage, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot; provided, however, that the following shall apply: 
A.  The sum of the side yard widths of any such lot or plot shall not be less than thirty percent of the width of the lot, but in no case less than ten percent of the width of the lot for any one side yard. 
B.  The depth of the rear yard of any such lot need not exceed twenty percent of the depth of the lot, but in no case less than twenty feet. 
C.  Notwithstanding the setback requirements set forth above, a nonconforming single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling on such a lot can be used, maintained and reconstructed, provided however that if the dwelling is destroyed or damaged, excluding purposeful destruction, to an extent of sixty percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed unless such reconstruction work shall be consistent with applicable codes at the time of new construction, an approved building permit is obtained within six months of such happening and diligently pursued to completion. Such reconstruction shall also comply with the restrictions on nonconforming development set forth in Section 17.32.030. This exception shall not apply in cases where the owner of a non-conforming lot also owns two or more abutting vacant lots of record. Such lot shall also meet all of the following requirements: 
1.  The dwelling should meet the requirements set forth in Table 17.08C except the minimum lot area; however, if setbacks cannot be met from Table 17.08C, then the dwelling shall be allowed to be built on the original footprint without an increase in the gross floor area. 
2.  The dwelling shall have a minimum width facing the street of the smaller of twenty-four feet or the width of the dwelling prior to such destruction; 
3.  The dwelling shall have a minimum depth perpendicular to the street of the smaller of twenty feet or the depth of the dwelling prior to such destruction. 
4.  A minimum of fifteen percent of the facade of the building facing the street shall consist of windows, doors and other building openings; 
5.  Any foundation skirting material shall have the appearance of masonry or poured concrete typical of site-built homes. Installation of the skirting must be installed within thirty days following the installation of the home, or the first day of May if the ground is frozen at the time the home is placed. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 2, 2-2-2015) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1370, § 2, adopted Feb. 2, 2015, repealed the former § 17.24.020, and enacted a new section as set out herein. The former § 17.24.020 pertained to use of existing lots of record and derived from Ord. 1086, § 17.702, adopted in 2000. 
17.24.030 - Setback adjustments. 
A.  Lots Adjoining Alleys. In calculating the depth of a required side or rear yard setback for a lot adjoining a dedicated public alley, one-half of the alley may be credited as a portion of the yard. However, no residential structure may be nearer than five feet to the near side of the alley. 
B.  Encroachments on Required Yards. Every part of a required yard shall be open and unobstructed from finished grade upward, except as specified herein. 
1.  Architectural projections, including roofs which cover porches, enclosed porches, window sills, belt courses, cornices, eaves, flues and chimneys, and ornamental features may project two feet into a required yard. Fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies opening to fire towers may project a maximum of two feet into required yards, provided that they do not obstruct the light and ventilation of adjacent buildings. 
2.  Terraces, patios, uncovered decks, and ornamental features which have no structural element more than two feet above or below the adjacent ground level may project ten feet into a required yard. However, all such projections must be set back at least three feet from an adjacent side lot line; or twenty feet from any street property line. 
3.  The structural alteration of an existing porch within the exterior dimensions of said porch shall not be considered a nonconforming structure within the scope of this title, even though the setback requirements of the district in which it is located may not be met. This shall be interpreted to mean that the replacement, reconstruction, or enclosing of an existing porch with a porch of the same or lesser dimension shall be considered a conforming structure even though the front, side, or rear yard dimensions required in the district in which it is located may not be met. The requirements of this section shall apply only to residential uses. For the purposes of this section a "porch" is defined as an open or enclosed covered entrance, entryway, or deck attached to and projecting from an exterior wall of an existing building. 
4.  For buildings constructed upon a front property line, a cornice may project into public right-of-way. Maximum projection is the smaller of three feet or five percent of the right-of-way width. 
5.  In commercial districts, a canopy may extend into a required front yard, provided that the canopy is set back at least five feet from the front property line, covers less than fifteen percent of the area of the required front yard, and has a vertical clearance of at least eight feet six inches.

Chapter 17.32 - NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT 
Sections: 

17.32.010 - Purpose. 
    Within the various districts established by this title or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this title but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the provisions of this title. It is the intent of this title to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this title to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1101, 2000) 
17.32.020 - Regulations additive. 
    Regulations for nonconforming uses are in addition to regulations for nonconforming structures. In the event of a conflict, the most restrictive regulation shall apply. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1102, 2000) 
17.32.030 - Residential districts. 
A.  Nonconforming Use of Land. The lawful use of land upon which no building or structure is erected or constructed which becomes nonconforming under the terms of this title as adopted or amended may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land is located. 
B.  Nonconforming Use of Structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this title, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not permitted by this title in the district in which it is located, except when required by law, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located. 
2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
3.  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a similar nature within the same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use. 
4.  In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of two years, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
5.  Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by this title that is destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the foundations, shall not be reconstructed and used as before such happening. If the structure be less than sixty percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed and used as before, provided it be done within six months of such happening, and be built of like or similar materials. 
C.  Nonconforming Structures. Where a structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance codified in this title that could not be built under the terms of this title by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
2.  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty percent or more of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this title. Any single-family or two-family dwelling which was a conforming structure at the time of passage of this ordinance may be structurally altered, and if destroyed may be reconstructed and used as before, provided the work shall be consistent with applicable codes at the time of new construction, an approved building permit is obtained within six months of such happening and diligently pursued to completion. Such reconstruction shall also comply with the restrictions set forth in section 17.24.020. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1103, 2000) 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 3, 2-2-2015) 
17.32.040 - Nonresidential districts. 
A.  Nonconforming Use of Land. The regulations described in Section 17.32.030 shall also apply to this section with the following exception: 
1.  A structure devoted to a nonconforming use in a non-residential zoning district may be structurally altered or enlarged if the addition satisfies the following conditions: 
a.  The enlargement or addition, when considered independently of the existing building, complies with all applicable setback, height, off-street parking, and landscaping requirements. 
b.  The building, after the addition, conforms to height, off-street parking, and building and impervious surface coverages applicable to its zoning district. 
c.  The construction is limited to buildings on land owned of record by the owner of the nonconforming use prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title. 
2.  A lawful nonconforming use may be changed only to a use type permitted in a zoning district that is equal to or less intensive than that normally required for the previous use. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1104, 2000) 
17.32.050 - Repair of nonconforming structures. 
A.  Nothing in this title shall be deemed to prevent the restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
B.  A lawful nonconforming building damaged by fire, explosion, storm or other calamity, except flood damages, may be repaired and reconstructed provided there is no increase in the degree of nonconformity. Repair and reconstruction within the designated floodplain shall be in conformance with Floodplain development regulations. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1105, 2000) 
17.32.060 - Recognition of nonconformances. 
A.  Unauthorized Nonconformances. Any use of land or structure which was not an authorized nonconformity under any previous zoning ordinance or similar regulations shall not be authorized to continue its nonconforming status pursuant to this title. 
B.  Nonconforming Uses and Conditional Use Permits. A lawful pre-existing use which would require a conditional use permit in its zoning district shall be presumed to have the appropriate permit and shall be considered a conforming use. The use shall be subject to the regulations governing lapses or revocation of permits, set forth in Chapter 17.34. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1106, 2000) 
17.32.070 - Discontinuance conformance required. 
A.  In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or premises is discontinued or its normal operation stopped for a period of one year, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(Ord. No. 1370, § 4, 2-2-2015) 
Chapter 17.34 - ADMINISTRATION AND PROCEDURES 
Sections: 

17.34.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter establishes the methods for implementation of this title. These provisions include procedures for reviewing specific uses within certain zoning districts; amending this title; and granting variances. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1201, 2000) 
17.34.020 - Site plan review procedure. 
A.  Purpose. The site plan review procedure is designed to assure that the design and location of commercial and industrial areas will be in conformance with the zoning standards of this title and are properly related to and in harmony with the existing and future business and industrial development of the city, including generally accepted principles of commercial, industrial and urban design. A detailed site plan shall be submitted showing the proposed use and development of all commercial and industrial sites for approval by the city council after review and recommendation by the planning and zoning commission. 
B.  Procedure. 
1.  Whenever any person, firm, corporation or other group wishes to develop any tract, lot or parcel of land within the city located in the R-3, UC, LC, DC, CC, GC, HC, BP, LI or GI zoning districts, except for residential development of four units or less, the person, firm, corporation or other group shall cause to be prepared a site plan of such development and shall submit fifteen copies of said site plan to the zoning administrator. The provisions of this section shall also be applicable to the redevelopment, enlargement or extension of more than twenty-five percent of any commercial or industrial uses and structures existing at the time of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title. The site plan shall contain such information and data as outlined herein. 
2.  The zoning administrator shall review the site plan for compliance with this title and shall refer a copy of the site plan to the city engineer, or such other person as shall be designated from time to time by the city council, who shall review said site plan as to its compliance with other ordinances of the city, its effect upon public utilities and the public street system, and submit his findings as soon as possible to the planning and zoning commission. 
3.  The zoning administrator shall also forward a copy of the site plan to each member of the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission shall, after receiving the report of the engineer and the zoning administrator, review the site plan for conformity with the regulations and standards contained herein, and may confer with the developer on changes deemed advisable in such site plan. 
4.  The planning and zoning commission shall forward its recommendation either for approval or disapproval of the site plan to the city council within forty-five days of the date of the submission of the site plan. If the commission does not act within forty-five days, the site plan shall be deemed to be approved by the commission unless the developer agrees to an extension of time. 
5.  The commission may, at its discretion, hold a public hearing on the site plan of the proposed development and prescribe the notice thereof and to whom such notice shall be given. 
6.  The city council shall, upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, either approve or disapprove the site plan of the proposed development. 
7.  No building permit or certificate of zoning compliance for any structure within any district within which a site plan is required shall be issued until the site plan has been approved as provided herein. 
8.  Upon final action by the planning and zoning commission on any site plan, a copy of the site plan with the action of the planning and zoning commission noted thereon and signed by the chairperson of the commission shall be filed with the city clerk. 
9.  If the zoning administrator finds that any construction or proposed construction or occupancy of a development on a tract of land for which a site plan has been approved will not substantially comply with the site plan as approved, or if he finds that the construction and development of the tract is not being carried out in accordance with the development schedule filed with the site plan, he shall suspend all building permits for the development and order all construction stopped until such time as the owner of the project, or his successors in interest, shall have provided him with proof satisfactory to him that the site plan will be complied with. The zoning administrator shall not issue a certificate of zoning compliance for any structure within the development while the building permit for the development has been suspended pursuant to this subsection. Any person aggrieved by any decision or action of the zoning administrator under this subsection may appeal such action or decision to the board of adjustment. 
10.  If the owner or developer of a tract of land for which a site plan has been approved determines that an extension of time is necessary or that a modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate or more practicable development of the site, he may apply for an amendment of the site plan. The planning and zoning commission may grant an extension of time or a modification of a previously approved site plan if it determines that such modification of the site plan would provide for a more appropriate development of the site. 
C.  Review. In reviewing a proposed site plan, the city council and the planning and zoning commission shall consider the location of the buildings on the site with respect to vehicular and pedestrian traffic to and from the buildings, traffic between the site and abutting streets, suitable layout and adequate provisions for off-street parking and loading, with due consideration given to the provision of traffic islands, pedestrian ways and landscaping within the parking area, provision for necessary screening between adjacent properties and the site, location and display of traffic signs to promote traffic patterns, location and display of business signs so as not to distract or confuse motorists and location and display of outdoor advertising so as to provide adequate visibility within the site during hours of night operation but not to have adverse effects on surrounding properties. 
D.  General Requirements. All site plans shall be drawn at a scale not less than one inch equals fifty feet. Ten copies of the site plan shall be submitted to the zoning administrator. The purpose of the site plan is to show all information needed to enable the zoning administrator, city engineer, planning and zoning commission and the city council to determine if the proposed development meets the requirements of this title. 
E.  Required Information. The site plan required shall include the following information concerning the proposed development: 
1.  Names of all persons having an interest in the property, legal description of property, point of compass, scale and date.

8.  Open spaces, yards, recreational areas, walkways, driveways, outside lighting, walls, fences, monuments, statues, signs and other manmade features to be used in the landscape of the proposed development. 
9.  Facilities for the collection and disposal of garbage and trash. 
10.  Location and type of all plants, grass and trees to be used in the landscape of the proposed development. Landscaping to be used for screening purposes shall be illustrated in elevation as well as plan, with the approximate size and name of plants, shrubs or trees to be planted clearly indicated. The plans and specifications shall include a right-of-way tree plan meeting the requirements of Section 12.40.00. 
11.  Location of entrances and exits from the proposed development onto public streets, and interior drives and proposed sidewalks in the development. 
12.  Proposed drainage facilities and provisions for flood control, if applicable. 
13.  The location, height and area of all signs (directional signs, identification signs, or temporary signs) in the proposed development. 
G.  Approval and Expiration. All site plan approvals shall expire and terminate one hundred eighty days after the date of council approval unless a building permit has been issued for the construction provided for in the site plan. The city council may, upon written request by the developer, extend the time for the issuance of a building permit for sixty days. In the event the building permit for the construction provided for in a site plan expires or is canceled, then such site plan approval shall thereupon terminate. 
(Ord. 1086 §17.1202, 2000) 
(Ord. No. 1379, § 4, 12-21-2015) 
17.34.030 - Conditional use permits. 
A.  Purpose. The conditional use permit procedure provides for board of adjustment review and approval of uses within zoning districts which have unusual site development or operating characteristics that could adversely affect surrounding properties. 
B.  Administration. The board of adjustment shall review, evaluate, and act upon all applications submitted pursuant to this procedure. The board of adjustment, following proper notice, shall hold a public hearing, on each conditional use permit application and, following such public hearing, shall act on the application. Before approval of any conditional use permit, the board shall review the conformity of the proposal with the criteria set forth in Table 17.34A. The board may approve or disapprove the conditional permit as submitted or, before approval, may require that the applicant modify, alter, adjust, or amend the proposal as the board deems necessary to the end that it preserve the intent and purpose of this title to promote public health, safety and the general welfare. 
C.  Application Requirements. An application for a conditional use permit may be filed with the zoning administrator by the owners(s) of a property or the owners' authorized agent. Applications for a conditional use permit under the terms of this section shall be accompanied by evidence concerning the feasibility of the proposed request and its effect on surrounding property and shall include a detailed site plan containing all requirements for site plan review set forth under Section 17.34.020(e) and (f). 
D.  Criteria for Review. The board shall review and act upon the request based on the criteria established in Table 17.34A and conformance with applicable regulations in this title. 
E.  Scope of Approval. 
1.  The board of adjustment may, at its discretion, apply a conditional use permit to a specific owner or applicant. The board may establish special site development or operational regulations as a condition of approval of a conditional use permit. 
2.  The board of adjustment shall not grant a conditional use permit for any home occupation/home-based business, which is otherwise prohibited under Section 17.22.110 of this title. 
F.  Change in Approved Special Permits. In the event a conditional permit is granted under the terms of this section, any change thereafter in the approved use or site plan shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original proposal. 
G.  Lapse and Revocation of Permit. 
1.  A conditional use permit shall become void two years after its effective date if the applicant has not carried out development or occupancy during that period, or sooner if so conditioned by the board of adjustment. 
2.  The board of adjustment may revoke a conditional use permit should the operation of the use subject to such permit violate the conditions under which the permit was granted. 
H.  Previously Approved Permits. Any conditional use approved under regulations in effect before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall be considered to have a valid conditional use permit, subject to requirements imposed at the time of its approval. 
I.  Appeals. Actions taken by the board of adjustment subject to this section may be appealed as provided for in Section 17.34.100. 
(Ord. 1125 §§2,3, 2002: Ord. 1086 §17.1203, 2000)

Chapter 17.36 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

17.36.010 - Statutory authority, findings of fact and purpose. 
A.  The Legislature of the State of Iowa has in Chapter 414, Code of Iowa, as amended, delegated the power to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare. 
B.  Findings of Fact. 
1.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Oskaloosa are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. 
2.  These flood losses, hazards, and related adverse effects are caused by: (i) The occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and (ii) the cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
C.  Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and property of the City of Oskaloosa and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace, safety, health, welfare, and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in [subsection (B)1 of this section] with provisions designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement. 
3.  Protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard. 
4.  Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program. 
(Ord. No. 1302, § 1, 4-4-2011) 
17.36.020 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Apply. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Oskaloosa which are located within the boundaries of the floodplain (overlay) district as established in [Section 17.36.030] of this chapter. 
B.  Rules for Interpretation of Floodplain (Overlay) District. The boundaries of the floodplain (overlay) district areas shall be determined by scaling distances on the official flood insurance rate map. When an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of a boundary, the city personnel appointed by the city manager or city engineer shall make the necessary interpretation. The board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the city personnel in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. It is not intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this chapter shall prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only. 
E.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The standards required by this chapter are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter does not imply that areas outside the designated floodplain (overlay) district areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Oskaloosa or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made there under. 
G.  Severability. If any section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby.

g.  Such other information as the administrator deems reasonably necessary (e.g., drawings or a site plan) for the purpose of this chapter. 
3.  Action on Permit Application. The administrator shall, within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed floodplain development meets the applicable standards of this chapter and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore. The administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the city board of adjustment. 
4.  Construction and Use to be as Provided in Application and Plans. Floodplain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use, arrangement, and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use, arrangement or construction. Any use, arrangement, or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. The applicant shall be required to submit certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate, registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill, building floor elevations, floodproofing, or other flood protection measures were accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, prior to the use or occupancy of any structure. 
C.  Variance. 
1.  The City of Oskaloosa Board of Appeals may authorize upon request in specific cases such variances from the terms of this chapter that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted must meet the following applicable standards. 
a.  Variances shall only be granted upon: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances. 
b.  Variances shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
c.  In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the administrator that: 
(i)  The issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
(ii)  Such construction increases risks to life and property. 
2.  Factors upon which the decision of the board of appeals shall be based - In passing upon applications for variances, the board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of this chapter and: 
a.  The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments. 
b.  The danger that materials may be swept on to other land or downstream to the injury of others. 
c.  The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions. 
d.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner. 
e.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city. 
f.  The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location. 
g.  The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 
h.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future. 
i.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
j.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles. 
k.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site. 
l.  The cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities (sewer, gas, electrical and water systems), facilities, streets and bridges. 
m.  Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this chapter. 
3.  Conditions attached to variances - Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this chapter. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to: 
a.  Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities. 
b.  Limitation of periods of use and operation. 
c.  Imposition of operational controls, sureties, and deed restrictions. 
d.  Requirements for construction of channel modifications, dikes, levees, and other protective measures, provided such are approved by the department of natural resources and are deemed the only practical alternative to achieving the purpose of this chapter. 
e.  Floodproofing measures.
