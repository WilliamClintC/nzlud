A resolution must be adopted to spend public funds in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) on any one project, or to accept public improvements and facilities upon their completion, and requires an affirmative vote of not less than a majority of all the council members.  Each councilmember’s vote 
on an ordinance, amendment, or resolution must be recorded. A measure which fails to receive sufficient votes for passage shall be considered defeated. 
 
As used in this chapter, "all of the members of the council" refers to all of the seats of the council including a vacant seat and a seat where the member is absent, but does not include a seat where the council member declines to vote by reason of a conflict of interest. 
          
A measure voted upon is not invalid by reason of a conflict of interest in a member of the council, unless the vote of the member of the council was decisive to passage of the measure.  The vote must be computed on the basis of the number of members not disqualified by reason of conflict of interest.  However, a majority of all members is required for a quorum.  For the purpose of this section, the      statement of a council member that the council member declines to vote by reason of conflict of interest is conclusive and must be entered of record. 
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.4)       
 
 2. PASSAGE OF ORDINANCES.  A proposed ordinance must be considered and voted on for passage at two council meetings prior to the meeting at which it is to  
  be finally passed, unless this requirement is suspended by a recorded vote of not less than three-fourths of the council members.  If a proposed ordinance or amendment fails to receive sufficient votes for passage at any consideration, the proposed ordinance or amendment shall be considered defeated. 
          (Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.3) 
 
      3.    OVERRIDING MAYOR'S VETO.  Within thirty (30) days after the Mayor's veto, the council may repass the ordinance or resolution by a vote of not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the council members; and the ordinance or resolution becomes effective upon repassage and publication.

      4.    MEASURES BECOME EFFECTIVE.  Measures passed by the council, other than motions, become effective in one of the following ways:  
  
            a.    If the Mayor signs the measure, a resolution becomes effective immediately upon signing; and an ordinance or amendment becomes a law when published, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the measure.

            b.    If the Mayor vetoes a measure and the council repasses the same measure after the Mayor's veto, a resolution becomes effective immediately upon repassage; and an ordinance or amendment becomes a law when published, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the measure.  
                               (Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.6(2))  
  
            c.    If the Mayor takes no action on the measure, a resolution becomes effective fourteen (14) days after the date of passage; and an ordinance or amendment becomes a law when published, but not sooner than fourteen (14) days after 
the day of passage, unless a subsequent effective date is provided within the measure.  
                               (Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.6(3))  
d. A motion becomes effective immediately upon passage of the motion 
 by the Council. 
(Code of Iowa, Sec. 380.6) 
 
 5. RESOLUTION OF NECESSITY FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT PROJECTS.  If, upon adoption of the plat, schedule, and estimate, the council determines to proceed with all or any part of the improvement it shall cause a proposed resolution of necessity to be prepared and introduced as provided in Section 384.49 of the Code of Iowa. 
   (Code of Iowa, Sec. 384.49)

10.08 GENDER BALANCE. All appointive boards, commissions, and committees shall be gender balanced.

8.03 ELIGIBILITY FOR TAX EXEMPTION.   
 
 1. The new construction of a shell building by a community development organization, a not-for-profit cooperative association under chapter 499, or a for-profit entity for speculative purposes is eligible for property tax exemption. The exemption shall be for one of the following:

b.      The value of an existing building being reconstructed or renovated, and the value of the land on which the building is located, if the reconstruction or renovation constitutes complete replacement or refitting of the existing building or structure.     
                              
2.   If the exemption is for a project described in Subsection 1.a. above, the exemption shall be effective for the assessment year in which the building is first assessed for property taxation or the assessment year in which the addition to an existing building first adds value.

Monthly Surcharge = (8.33/106) V X [(BOD-300)+SS-300)+Grease-150)+NH3-N-25)] 
 
8.33 = lb./gallon 
V = volume in gallons per month 
X = cost per pound of treated pollutants 
106 = conversion factor

 6.19  WATER MAIN EXTENSION POLICY.  A water main extension will be made by the city upon application by any person desiring service to his or her property who signs a contract for such service and pays the cost thereof through a connection charge or otherwise as required by this chapter.  No water main will be extended beyond the city limits for commercial or residential purposes unless the applicant agrees to voluntarily petition for annexation simultaneously with such extension where the applicant's property is contiguous to the corporate limits, or agrees to so petition as soon as the applicant's property becomes contiguous to the city limits and files for future use such petition so conditioned.  
  
      Water mains will be extended beyond the city limits for any industrial establishment which will employ ten employees or more within one year of the extension over the above existing employment in the community, without annexation being required if it is shown that the industry needs the tax benefit, or if it is on property not contiguous to the city limits.  
  
      If the water Superintendent determines that no foreseeable need will occur for a public water main, and so recommends to the city council upon council approval, an applicant for service may be permitted to construct a private main in an undeveloped public right-of-way (i.e. no traveled way or no more than a graded and/or traveled vehicular way), provided the work shall meet the city requirements for installations in the public way, including placement in the standard location, protection of work, quality of construction, and backfilling.  Such main shall originate in a meter and be the property of the owner who shall be responsible for maintenance in the same manner as with water service pipes.  It shall be a condition of the contract for connection that the city will not reimburse the owner for such a main if it has to be replaced with a public main after five years or more use.  
 
6.20  MAIN EXTENSION CHARGES.  Water service shall be provided through an extension of a water main in the following cases:  
  
      1.    For distances up to 50 feet beyond existing end of a city-owned main, upon request of a person who contracts to immediately tap the main upon the completion of the extension and who can be expected to use water service upon the completion of construction of the residence or commercial building or facility to be served...no connection charge.  
  
      2.    Where two applicants, one on each side of a street make application at the same time under the same contract conditions as in "1." above, extension will be made for 100 feet...no connection charge.  
 
      3.    Where a single tap is contemplated by an applicant for an extension exceeding 50 feet and it is not foreseeable that other customer taps will be applied for before construction is begun, the applicant shall deposit with the City Clerk a sum equal to the estimated cost of the extension required, as determined by the water Superintendent, and enter into a contract providing for the deposit and any future rebates in accordance with the following provisions:  
  
            a.    The city will refund any excess of deposit over the actual cost for the extension.  
  
            b.    For each customer later connected to the main the city will rebate the proportional share (by feet of frontage) as set out in the contract, the cost of the extension to the original applicant, but not in excess of the final payment by that applicant, provided such connections are made within five years, after which time no rebates shall be paid.  However, the applicant shall be entitled to a refund of the unpaid balance of the full amount deposited with the city whenever the revenue derived from the sale of water to customers directly connected to the extension is equal in each of two consecutive twelve (12) month periods within the five years following application to ten (10) percent of the total actual cost of the main extension.  Customer is defined as the occupant of a one-family dwelling, a one-family portion of a two-family dwelling, or as a single commercial establishment contracting for water in its own name (and from its own meter).  
  
      4.    The main extension shall be built to city standards and become the property of the city as it is installed.  If the applicant hires the construction, the city shall inspect the work for compliance with city standards and may enforce the specifications.  
  
6.21  WATER MAIN CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.  No water tap will be allowed for service to a property except when a public water main runs along the street in front of the property (unless an alley or easement is determined by the city to be the best approach to serving the property) and at least ten (10) feet beyond the side property line, extended, nearest to the supply side of the main. The tap must be at least four (4) feet beyond that property line, extended, of the abutting property.  No public main shall be less than six (6") inches in diameter, but no such six-inch (6") main shall be extended more than two hundred (200) feet and only if no foreseeable and feasible user can be served beyond said 200 feet.  The city reserves the right to put in the size of main required for an adequate system of mains in the future to provide fire flow and adequate pressure for reasonably foreseeable customer service. The main shall be installed and of the quality required by specifications adopted by the council upon recommendation of the water Superintendent.  
  
6.22  INSPECTION AND APPROVAL.  All water service pipes and their connections to the water system must be inspected and approved by the Superintendent.  If approval is refused, the plumber or property owner must immediately proceed to correct the work in order to meet approval.

4. Preservation and Maintenance of Open Space.  In a PUD, adequate provision shall be made for the permanent preservation and maintenance of common open space either by private reservation or dedication to the public: 
 
  a) In the case of private reservation, the open area to be reserved shall be protected against building development by conveying to the City as part of the conditions for project approval an open space easement over such open areas restricting the area against any future building or use except as  is consistent with that of providing landscaped open space for the aesthetic  and recreational benefit of the development.  Buildings or uses for  noncommercial, recreational or cultural purposes compatible with the open  space objective may be permitted only where specifically authorized as part  of the development plan or subsequently, with the expressed approval of  the Zoning Board of Adjustment following approval of building, site and  operational plans by the Planning Commission.  All easements subject to acceptance by the City Council. 
 
  b) The care and maintenance of such open space reservation shall be assured by establishment of appropriate management organization for the project.  The manner of assuring maintenance and assessing such cost to individual properties shall be included in any contractual agreement with the City and shall be included in the title to each property. 
 
  c) Ownership and tax liability of private open space reservation shall be established in a manner acceptable to the City and made a part of the conditions of the plan approval. 
 
5.  Approval of the Specific Implementation Plan

This shall include posting a performance bond or certified check with City of Orange City, Iowa, guaranteeing that required improvements will be  constructed according to the approved implementation schedule.  This shall  be accomplished prior to the issuance of any building permit. 
 
  d)  Any subsequent change or addition to the plans or use shall first be submitted for approval to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Planning  Commission and if such change or addition constitutes a substantial  alteration of the original plan, the procedures in above shall be required.

a) That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;

variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure.  
 
6. The Board of Adjustment shall further make a finding that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

In granting any variance, the Board of Adjustment may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Ordinance.

2. Whether there is a need for additional land zoned for the purpose requested.  
 
3. Whether the proposed change is consistent with the current land use plan, considering such factors as:  
  
a. Whether the rezoning would result in a population density or development which would in turn cause demand for services and utilities in excess of the capacity planned for the area;  
 
b. Whether the rezoning would result in the generating of traffic in excess of the capacity of existing or planned streets in the vicinity.  
 
c. Whether there is an intent on the part of the applicant to develop the property to be rezoned diligently and within a reasonable time.

  (7) Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
 
(8) Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely placed in the City under conditions approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission . 
 
(9) Streets with centerline offsets of less than one hundred fifty (150) feet shall  
be avoided (fig. 5). 
 
  (10) A tangent of at least one hundred (100) feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
 
  (11) When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point by more than ten (10) degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than one hundred (100) feet for minor and collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Planning and Zoning Commission shall determine for special cases. 
 
  (12) Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than ten (10) degrees (fig. 6). 
 
  (13) Property lines at street intersections shall be platted with a radius of ten (10) feet or an acceptable chord length, or of a greater radius where the Planning and Zoning Commission may deem it necessary. 
 
  (14) Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; 
and where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds it will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
 
 
(15) Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than five hundred (500) feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a cul-de-sac, having a minimum outside roadway diameter of at least eighty (80) feet, and a street property line diameter of at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet (fig. 7). 
 
(16) No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
 
(b) Street Grades. Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following, with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves: 
 
Street Type      Percent Grade 
Arterial or major      5 
Collector       7 
Minor        10 
Marginal access      15 
 
(c) Street Right-of-Way 
 
  (1) Street right-of-way widths for major streets will be shown on the Major Streets Plan of the Comprehensive Plan for Orange City or unless otherwise noted, shall be a continuation of the adjoining existing arterial street. 
 
(2) Street right-of-way widths for minor street shall be seventy-five (75) feet for  
streets designed for on-street parking and a minimal thirty-five (35) feet shall be dedicated whenever subdivided property adjoins a half street as designated by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The remainder of the street shall be dedicated. No homes shall be constructed on half streets. 
 
(d) Alleys. Vehicular alleys may not be provided in a residential block. Service alleys may be provided in a residential block. Alleys are required in the rear of all business lots unless other adequate provisions are made for service and deliveries, and shall be at least twenty (20) feet wide. 
 
(e) Blocks. No block shall be longer than one thousand two hundred (1,200) feet. Where blocks are over seven hundred fifty (750) feet in length, a cross walk with a right-of-way of at least ten (10) feet in width may be required near the center of the block. 
 
(f) Lots 
 
  (1) The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and to the character of surrounding development. 
 
(2) However, no residential lot shall be less than seventy (70) feet in width at  
the building line, or less than six thousand five hundred (6,500) square feet in area. 
 
(3) In any subdivision where neither a public sewer nor a public water supply is  
available, no lot shall have an area of less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or a width of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet measured at the building line. Where a public water supply is available but individual sewage disposal devices are used, no lot shall have an area of less than twelve thousand (12,000) square feet or a width of less than one hundred (100) feet. 
 
(4) Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit the establishment of  
front building lines on both adjoining streets. 
 
  (5) In all lots so far as possible, the side lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, except where a variation of this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. 
 
(6) Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided, except where  
their use will produce definite advantages in meeting special situations in relation to topography, sound site planning, and proper land use. 
 
(g) Public Sites and Open Spaces. Where an area being subdivided includes lands, proposed to be used for parks or schools under the duly adopted Comprehensive Plan of the City, the subdivider shed indicate the location of such areas on the subdivision plat. Park sites within the city limits are to be purchased within two (2) years of the recording date of the subdivision by the City at the appraised raw land value prior to subdivision plus one-half (1/2) of the cost of grading and paving, including curbs, of the portion of any streets that are contiguous to the site.  School sites are to be reserved for four (4) years, giving the public school system the right to purchase the land at the appraised raw land value prior to subdivision, plus one-half (1/2) the cost of grading and paving, including curbs, of any streets contiguous to the site. Should the park or school sites not be purchased within the time limit specified above, the subdivider may then sell them for an alternate purpose as shown on the approved subdivision plat. 
 
(h) Character of Development. The Commission and City Council may require that certain minimum regulations regarding type and character of development be incorporated in the owner's declaration of plat. Such regulations shall be intended to protect the character and development of the platted subdivision as well as that of the surrounding development. 
 
(i) Easements Along Streams and Watercourses. Wherever any stream or surface watercourse is located in an area that is being subdivided, the subdivider shall, at his own expense, make adequate provisions for the proper drainage of surface water and shall also 
provide and dedicate to the City of Orange City an easement along said streams and watercourses, meeting the approval of the Commission. 
 
(j) Easements for Public Utilities.  Public rights-of-way dedicated for alleys, parks, and service roads, may be used for public utilities. All easements to be granted for utilities shall be constructed as either pedestrian walkways, park-ways, plazas, open spaces, or playgrounds as may be deemed appropriate by the Commission. All easements and rights-of-way for parks or service roads or alleys shall be not less than eight (8) feet and granted by each adjoining owner. Larger dimensions may be required where it is necessary for extension of main sewers or other utilities or where both water and sewer are located in the same easement. No buildings or structures will be permitted on any part of an easement without approval of the Commission and authorization of the City Council. 
K. Buffer Zones Between Subdivisions.  Where an area being subdivided borders an existing subdivision and the proposed subdivision will have a different zoning designation than the existing subdivision, a buffer zone between the two districts may be required, especially where the existing subdivision is zoned residential. The buffer zone shall be continuous in length along the boundary of the proposed subdivision in the area where different adjoining designations occur. The buffer zone shall be of adequate width to allow the placement of fences, trees, landscaping, green spaces, etc. to provide an aesthetically pleasing separation between the different districts. The area designated as the buffer zone may contain required easements for utilities, etc., but the width of the buffer zone shall be in addition to any required yard setbacks as set forth in the zoning ordinance. Where a public street right-of-way separates the proposed and existing subdivisions, such public street right-of-way may be considered an adequate buffer zone.

13-1- 1:  TITLE. 
This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as "The Orange City  
Municipal Airport Height Zoning Ordinance." 
 
13-1- 2:  DEFINITIONS. 
As used in this Ordinance, unless the context otherwise requires: 
 
AIRPORT:  The Orange City Municipal Airport. 
 
AIRPORT ELEVATION:  The highest point of an airport's usable landing area measured in feet above mean sea level, which elevation is established to be one thousand four hundred fourteen (1,414) feet. 
 
AIRPORT HAZARD:  Any structure or object of natural growth located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use or land near such airport, which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or takeoff at such airport as is otherwise hazardous to such landing or takeoff of aircraft. 
 
AIRPORT PRIMARY SURFACE: A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface extends two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface of a runway will be that width prescribed in Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) for the most precise approach existing or planned for either end of that runway. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as the elevation of the nearest point on the runway centerline. 
 
AIRSPACE HEIGHT:   For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set forth in this Ordinance and shown on the zoning map, the datum shall be mean sea level elevation unless otherwise specified. 
 
CONTROL ZONE:   Airspace extending upward from the surface of the earth which may include one or more airports and is normally a circular area of five (5) statute miles in radius, with extensions where necessary to include instrument approach and departure paths. 
 
INSTRUMENT RUNWAY:   A runway having an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities or area type navigation equipment, for which an instrument approach procedure has been approved or planned. 
 
MINIMUM DESCENT ALTITUDE:   The lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure, where no electronic glide slope is provided. 
 
MINIMUM ENROUTE ALTITUDE:  The altitude in effect between radio fixes which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstruction clearance requirements between those fixes. 
 
MINIMUM OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE ALTITUDE: The specified altitude in effect between radio fixes or VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route segments which meets obstruction clearance requirements for the entire route segment and which assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within twenty-two (22) miles of a VOR. 
 
RUNWAY:   A defined area on an airport prepared for landing, and takeoff of aircraft along its length. 
 
VISUAL RUNWAY:   A runway intended solely for the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures with no straight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designation indicated on a FAA approved airport layout plan, a military services approved military airport layout plan, or by any planning document submitted to the FAA by competent authority. 
 
13-1- 3: ZONES AND AIRSPACE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS . 
In order to carry out the provisions of this Section, there are hereby created and established certain zones according to FAA requirements. A structure located in more than one (1) zone of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
 
(a) Airport Height Zones. 
 
(1) Horizontal Zones: The land lying under a horizontal plane one hundred fifty  
(150) feet above the established airport elevation, the perimeter of which is constructed by: 
 
  [a] Swinging arcs of five thousand (5,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of Runways 16 and 34 and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. 
 
No structure shall exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation in the horizontal zone according to FAA requirements. 
 
(2) Conical Zone: The land lying under a surface extending outward and upward from the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. No structure shall penetrate the conical surface to the conical zone according to FAA requirements. 
 
(3) Approach Zone: The land lying under a surface longitudinally centered on the extended runway centerline and extending outward and upward from each end of the primary surface. 
 
[a] The inner edge of the Approach Surface is: 
 
[1] Five hundred (500) feet wide for Runways 16 and 34. 
 
[b] The outer edge of the approach zone is: 
 
[1] Two thousand (2,000) feet for Runways 16 and 34. 
 
[c] The Approach Zone extends for a horizontal distance of: 
 
[1] Five thousand (5,000) feet at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1)  
for Runways 16 and 34. 
 
No structure shall exceed the approach surface to any runway according to FAA requirements. 
(4) Transitional Zone: The land lying under those surfaces extending outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline and the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven (7) to one (1) from the sides or the primary surface and from the sides of the Approach Surfaces. 
 
No structure shall exceed the Transitional Surface according to FAA requirements. 
 
(5) No structure shall be erected in Sioux County that raises the published Minimum Descent Altitude or Decision Height for an instrument approach to any runway, nor shall any structure be erected that causes the Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude or Minimum Enroute Altitude to be increased on any Federal Airway in Sioux County. 
 
13-1-4:  USE RESTRICTIONS. 
 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of Section 13-1-3, no use may be made of land or water within Orange City or Sioux County in such a manner as to interfere with the operation of any airborne aircraft. The following special requirements shall apply to each permitted use:
