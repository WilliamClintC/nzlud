    1. The permittee notifies the city of the proposed transfer;
    2. A written agreement containing a specific date of transfer of permit responsibility and coverage between the current permittee and the transferee (including acknowledgment that the existing permittee is liable for violations up to that date, and that the transferee is liable for violations from that date on) is submitted to the city;
    3. The transferee certifies in writing to the city his intent to operate the facility without making such material and substantial alterations or additions to the facility as would significantly change the nature or quantities of pollutants discharged and thus constitute cause for permit modification. However, the city may allow, at its discretion, a temporary transfer of the permit without permit modification for good cause (e.g., to enable the transferee to purge and empty the facility’s treatment system prior to making alterations) despite the transferee’s intent to make such material and substantial alterations or additions to the facility; and
    4. The city within 30 days does not notify the current permittee and the transferee of their intent to modify, revoke and reissue, or terminate the permit and to require that a new application be filed rather than agreeing to the transfer of the permit.
G. Revocation of Permit. Any user who violates the following conditions of the permit, or this chapter, or applicable state, federal, or local regulations, is subject to having his permit revoked:
    1. Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of his discharge;
    2. Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics;
    3. Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring by the city, regulatory jurisdiction;
    4. Continued or deliberate violation of conditions of the permit. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 12; Code 1999 § 9-42.]

13.10.140 Monitoring facilities.
The city may require the user to construct, at his own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the user’s sewer or internal drainage systems, and may also require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed, and operated at the user’s expense. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The manhole sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s requirements and all applicable local city construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city unless a time extension is granted by the city. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 13; Code 1999 § 9-43.]

13.10.150 Inspection and sampling.
The city, and duly authorized and properly identified representative of the city, or properly authorized and identified representative of any local, state, or federal regulatory agency, may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representatives, or any local, state, or federal representatives, ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection or sampling or in performance of any of their duties. The city, local, state, or federal representatives shall have the right to set up on the user’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, the city and/or employee of the POTW, or appropriate state, or federal representatives, will be permitted to enter within a reasonable time for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Inspector may be escorted at the discretion of the user. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 14; Code 1999 § 9-44.]

13.10.160 Pretreatment.
Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the limitations established herein before discharging to any community sewer. Any facilities required by the city shall be provided and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted and approved by the city before the construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility, as necessary, to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under this chapter, or to any state or federal regulatory agency having the authority to impose such requirements. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported and be approved by the city and all state and federal agencies having regulatory authority. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 15; Code 1999 § 9-45.]

13.10.170 Protection from accidental discharge.
As determined by the city, each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter. Such facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user’s expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to and approved by the city and, where required, to all state and federal agencies for review. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user of the responsibility of modifying the facility, as necessary, to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of this section. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 16; Code 1999 § 9-46.]

13.10.200 Administrative enforcement remedies.
A. Notification of Violation. If wastewater is accidentally discharged in violation of this chapter, users shall orally notify the city at 765-762-2467 immediately to enable the city to take countermeasures to minimize damage to the community sewer, treatment facility, treatment process, and receiving waters.
When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter or order issues hereunder, the superintendent may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, provide to the superintendent an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
B. Compliance Orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the superintendent may require the user responsible for the discharge, through written notification, to submit for approval a detailed compliance schedule of violations. If the user does not come into compliance within the approved time, the city will proceed with cease and desist procedures. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
C. Cease and Desist Orders.
    1. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issues hereunder, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the superintendent following a meeting with the industrial user may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
        a. Comply with all requirements;
        b. Comply with all requirements in accordance with a compliance schedule set forth by the city; or
        c. Take appropriate remedial or preventative action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
    2. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
    3. The response reply to this order will be evaluated as to whether the discharger has returned to compliance. If the user does not come into compliance, the city will proceed with injunctive relief and the imposition of civil penalties.
D. Show Cause Hearing. The superintendent may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
E. Emergency Suspensions. 
    1. 
        a. The superintendent may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The superintendent may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
        b. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The superintendent may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed.
    2. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 19; Code 1999 § 9-49.]

13.10.210 Judicial enforcement remedies.
A. Injunctive Relief. When the superintendent finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the superintendent may petition the Fountain County court through the city’s attorney for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
B. Civil Penalties. 
    1. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of $100.00 for the first offense, $200.00 for the second offense, and $500.00 for the third and each recurring offense in the same calendar year. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
    2. The superintendent may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, court costs, and expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.
C. Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided in this chapter are not exclusive. The superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 20; Code 1999 § 9-50.]

13.10.220 Compliance procedures.
A. Compliance Schedule Reports. Any industrial user which is not in compliance with the city’s ordinance limitations must develop a compliance schedule. The schedule should contain increments of progress (hiring engineers, starting construction, etc.) which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the operation of pretreatment equipment to meet the city’s pretreatment standards. All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule. This report must include whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse between progress reports.
B. Reports. This requirement calls for the submission of all notices and self-monitoring reports from industrial users that are necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. These reports will normally be required on a monthly basis.
C. Baseline Report – 403.12(b).  Within 180 days after the effective date of a federal categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made on a category, whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such federal categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the city’s system will be required to submit to the city a report containing listed in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(1) through (7) of the general pretreatment regulations.
Upon promulgation of federal categorical pretreatment standard, the city will provide the appropriate form for distribution to the industrial users who are affected by the promulgated standard. The industrial users are then required to submit the completed report to the city.
D. Compliance Schedule Reports – 403.12(c) (Categorical Industries). These reporting conditions apply to the compliance schedule required in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(7). This schedule is necessary whenever an industrial user is not meeting federal categorical pretreatment standards at the time of promulgation of that standard. The schedule contains increments of progress (i.e., hiring an engineer, completing plans, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.) which correspond to specific dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard.
All industrial users subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the city no later than 14 days following each date in the compliance schedule including the final date for compliance. This report must include, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on that date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event can more than nine months elapse between such progress reports.
E. Compliance Report – 403.12(d).  Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with an applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard, any industrial user subject to those standards must submit to the city a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge generated from the regulated process which are limited by federal categorical pretreatment standards.
The report must also state whether applicable standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharge into compliance. This statement should be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user.
F. Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance – 403.12(e).  Any discharger subject to an applicable federal categorical pretreatment standard must submit to the city during the months of June and December, or more frequently if required by the city, following the final compliance date of that pretreatment standard, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the discharge which are limited by the federal categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report must include a record of all measured or estimated average or maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows are to be reported on the basis of actual measurement, except, where cost of feasibility considerations justify, the city may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The city, considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may authorize submission of the reports on months other than those specified above.
G. Record Retention. All dischargers subject to local, state, or federal regulations must retain and preserve for at least three years any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries relating to monitoring sampling, and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a discharger in connection with its discharge. All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any enforcement or litigation activities brought by the city must be retained and preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitation concerning any appeals have expired. [Ord. 5, 2012 § 1; Ord. 16, 1995 § 21; Code 1999 § 9-51.]

Violations of this section shall subject the violator to the provisions of AMC 1.05.170.

The clerk-treasurer, acting as the hearing officer for the extension request, may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. The hearing officer may require partial payment of the delinquent bill in return for granting an extension.

The written appeal request shall set forth in detail (1) the extraordinary hardship or other unavoidable circumstances whereby the delinquent bill cannot be fully paid within the allowed period, (2) the specific relief requested, and (3) the reason(s) that the person owing an unpaid water or sewer bill believes that the adverse determination of the clerk-treasurer was arbitrary or capricious. The common council shall consider such appeal at its next regularly scheduled common council meeting. Any contemplated discontinuation of water service shall be deferred pending the determination of the appeal by the common council. The common council in its appeal determination may (1) deny the appeal, or (2) grant the appeal in whole or in part, and (3) may require partial payment of the delinquent bill in return for granting an extension. Upon denial of the appeal the delinquent user shall be given 48 hours’ notice of the appeal denial prior to the discontinuation of water service. [Ord. 9, 2013 § 1; Code 1999 § 9-89.]

[Ord. 827-69 § 1; Bk. 23, pp. 56 – 57; Code 1999 § 9-70.]

13.30.020 Materials required.
A. The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM specification or equal; vitrified clay type I joint sewer pipe, ASTM specification or equal; or other suitable materials approved by the said inspector. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within 10 feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints. Cast iron pipes with leaded joints may be required by the said inspector where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots or across easements, under driveways or sidewalks. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the said inspector.
B. The size and slope of the building sewers shall be subject to the approval of the said inspector, but in no event shall the diameter be less than six inches. The slope of such six-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot.
C. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at a uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings.
D. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drains shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. No water-operated sewage ejector shall be used.
E. All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the said inspector. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specifications except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected by the inspector or his representative. Unless otherwise approved by the inspector, all building sewer beds shall be gravel.
F. All joints and connections shall be made gas tight and water tight. Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp and filled with molten lead, Federal Specifications QQ-L-L56, not less than one inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and caulked tight. No paint, varnish, or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the joint has been tested and approved.
All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals shall be made with approved jointing material in accordance with the latest edition of Volume 111, Plumbing Rules and Regulations of the Administrative Building Council of the state of Indiana.
Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval of the said inspector.
G. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made by the “Y” branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location.
If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less and no properly located “Y” branch is available, the owner shall at his expense install a “Y” branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the said inspector. Where the public sewer is greater than 12 inches in diameter, and no properly located “Y” branch is available, a neat hole may be cut in the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees. A 45-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and water tight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the said inspector.
H. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the said inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the said inspector or his representative.
I. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the said city. [Ord. 827-69 § 2; Code 1999 § 9-71.]

13.30.030 Penalties.
A. Any person found to be violating any provision of this chapter shall be served by the city with written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
B. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for in subsection A of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $10.00 for each violation. Each day in which any such violation shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense.
C. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the city by reason of such violation. [Ord. 827-69 § 3; Code 1999 § 9-72.]

Article I. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives

15.25.010 Statutory authorization.
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the common council of the city of Attica does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 1(A).]

15.25.020 Findings of fact.
A. The flood hazard areas of the city of Attica are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 1(B).]

15.25.030 Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
F. Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 1(C).]

15.25.040 Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
A. To protect human life and health.
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
G. To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 1(D).]

Article II. Definitions

15.25.050 Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
“A zone” means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1 – A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:
    1. Zone A. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
    2. Zones AE and A1 – A30. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1 – A30.)
    3. Zone AO. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
    4. Zone AH. Areas subject to inundation by one percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
    5. Zone AR. Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
    6. Zone A99. Areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
“Accessory structure (appurtenant structure)” means a structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
“Addition (to an existing structure)” means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
“Appeal” means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO or AH zone on the community’s flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
“Base flood elevation (BFE)” means the elevation of the one percent annual chance flood.
“Basement” means that portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

    1. Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure;
    2. Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days;
    3. Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects;
    4. Construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements, etc.;
    5. Mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations;
    6. Construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
    7. Storage of materials; or
    8. Any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.

“Elevated structure” means a nonbasement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
“Elevation certificate” is a certified statement that verifies a structure’s elevation information.
“Emergency program” means the first phase under which a community participates in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
“Encroachment” means the advance or infringement of uses, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain.
“Existing construction” means any structure for which the “start of construction” commenced before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
“Existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
“Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision” means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
“FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“Five-hundred-year flood (500-year flood)” means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year.
“Flood” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.
“Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)” means an official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory floodway.
“Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)” means an official map of a community, issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been identified as Zone A.
“Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means an official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
“Flood insurance study (FIS)” is the official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
“Flood-prone area” means any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “Flood.”)
“Flood protection grade (FPG)” is the elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See “Freeboard.”)
“Floodplain” means the channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
“Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
“Floodplain management regulations” means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
“Floodproofing certificate” is a form used to certify compliance for nonresidential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a registered professional engineer or architect.
“Floodproofing (dry floodproofing)” is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces.
“Floodway” is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood of any river or stream.
“Freeboard” means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.
“Fringe” is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
“Functionally dependent facility” means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
“Hardship” (as related to variances of this chapter) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city of Attica common council requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
“Highest adjacent grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
“Historic structure” means any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
“Increased cost of compliance (ICC)” means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.
“Letter of map amendment (LOMA)” means an amendment to the currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located in a SFHA. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
“Letter of map revision (LOMR)” means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.
“Letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F)” means an official revision by letter to an effective NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA’s determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
“Lowest adjacent grade” means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure.
“Lowest floor” means the lowest of the following:
    1. The top of the lowest level of the structure;
    2. The top of the basement floor;
    3. The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure;
    4. The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars;
    5. The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of floodwaters unless:
        a. The walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters by providing a minimum of two openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls having a total net area of one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher; and
        b. Such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access.
“Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”
“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
“Map amendment” means a change to an effective NFIP map that results in the exclusion from the SFHA of an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA).
“Map panel number” is the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
“Market value” means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
“Mitigation” means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.
“National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry.
“National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929” as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
“New construction” means any structure for which the “start of construction” commenced after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
“New manufactured home park or subdivision” means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
“North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88)” as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
“Obstruction” includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, canalization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
“One-hundred-year flood (100-year flood)” is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one percent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory flood.”
“One percent annual chance flood” is the flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one percent annual chance flood. See “Regulatory flood.”
“Participating community” is any community that voluntarily elects to participate in the NFIP by adopting and enforcing floodplain management regulations that are consistent with the standards of the NFIP.
“Physical map revision (PMR)” is an official republication of a community’s FEMA map to effect changes to base (one percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways, and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements, annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
“Post-FIRM construction” means construction or substantial improvement that started on or after the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later.
“Pre-FIRM construction” means construction or substantial improvement, which started on or before December 31, 1974, or before the effective date of the initial FIRM of the community, whichever is later.
“Probation” is a means of formally notifying participating communities of violations and deficiencies in the administration and enforcement of the local floodplain management regulations.
“Public safety and nuisance” means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin.
“Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections; (3) designed to be self propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
“Regular program” means the phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP where more comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.
“Regulatory flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in AMC 15.25.070. The “regulatory flood” is also known by the terms “base flood,” “one percent annual chance flood,” and “100-year flood.”
“Repetitive loss” means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event.
“Section 1316” is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
“Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means those lands within the jurisdictions of the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the city of Attica are generally identified as such on the Fountain County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated February 6, 2013. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Fountain County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city or that may be annexed into the city are generally identified as such on the Fountain County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated February 6, 2013. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1 – A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO.)
“Start of construction” includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
“Structure” means a structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
“Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
“Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure.”
“Suspension” means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
“Variance” is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
“Watercourse” means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
“Water surface elevation” means the height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
“X zone” means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
“Zone” means a geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
Zone A. See definition for “A zone.”
“Zone B, C, and X” means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.) [Ord. 8, 2012 § 2.]

Article III. General Provisions

15.25.060 Lands to which this chapter applies.
This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood-prone areas within the jurisdiction of the city of Attica. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(A).]

15.25.070 Basis for establishing regulatory flood data.
This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
A. The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city of Attica shall be as delineated on the one percent annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Fountain County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas dated February 6, 2013, and the corresponding flood insurance rate map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated February 6, 2013.
B. The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the city of Attica, delineated as an “A zone” on the Fountain County and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated February 6, 2013, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
C. In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood-prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(B).]

15.25.080 Establishment of floodplain development permit.
A floodplain development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(C).]

15.25.090 Compliance.
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(D).]

15.25.100 Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(E).]

15.25.110 Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground elevations.
A. In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
B. If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
C. If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(F).]

15.25.120 Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:
A. Considered as minimum requirements.
B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(G).]

15.25.130 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this chapter does not create any liability on the part of [Click here and type name of Community], the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the state of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(H).]

15.25.140 Penalties for violation.
Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the zoning code for the city of Attica. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000.
A. A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist.
B. The city of Attica common council shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
C. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(I).]

15.25.150 Increased cost of compliance (ICC).
In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure,” the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 3(J).]

Article IV. Administration

15.25.160 Designation of administrator.
The common council of the city of Attica hereby appoints the building commissioner to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter and is herein referred to as the floodplain administrator. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 4(A).]

15.25.170 Permit procedures.
Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically the following information is required:
A. Application Stage. 
    1. A description of the proposed development.
    2. Location of the proposed development sufficient to accurately locate property and structure in relation to existing roads and streams.

I. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this chapter.
J. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if said nonconformity is not further extended, or replaced.
K. Whenever any portion of the SFHA is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the BFE shall be compensated for and balanced by an equivalent volume of excavation taken below the BFE. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the volume of storage lost (replacement ratio of one to one) due to the fill or structure.
    1. The excavation shall take place in the floodplain and in the same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located.
    2. Under certain circumstances, the excavation may be allowed to take place outside of but adjacent to the floodplain; provided, that the excavated volume will be below the regulatory flood elevation, will be in the same property in which the authorized fill or structure is located, will be accessible to the regulatory floodwater, will not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater, and that it shall not be refilled.
    3. The excavation shall provide for true storage of floodwater but shall not be subject to ponding when not inundated by floodwater.
    4. The fill or structure shall not obstruct a drainage way leading to the floodplain.
    5. The grading around the excavation shall be such that the excavated area is accessible to the regulatory floodwater.
    6. The fill or structure shall be of a material deemed stable enough to remain firm and in place during periods of flooding and shall include provisions to protect adjacent property owners against any increased runoff or drainage resulting from its placement.
    7. Plans depicting the areas to be excavated and filled shall be submitted prior to the actual start of construction or any site work; once site work is complete, but before the actual start of construction, the applicant shall provide to the floodplain administrator a certified survey of the excavation and fill sites demonstrating the fill and excavation comply with this chapter. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(A).]

15.25.200 Specific standards.
In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:
A. In addition to the requirements of AMC 15.25.190, all structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the following situations:

    2. Addition or improvement made to any existing structure:
        a. Where the cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the existing structure (excluding the value of the land).
        b. With a previous addition or improvement constructed since the community’s first floodplain ordinance.
    3. Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the costs of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure (excluding the value of the land) before damage occurred.
    4. Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days.
    5. Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a new manufactured home on an existing site. This chapter does not apply to returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage.
    6. Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
B. Residential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection D of this section.
C. Nonresidential Construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure (or manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation) or be floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of subsection D of this section. Structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the following:
    1. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in AMC 15.25.180(K).
    2. Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an outside source of electricity.
D. Elevated Structures. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above the FPG.
Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:
    1. Provide a minimum of two openings located in a minimum of two exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area).
    2. The bottom of all openings shall be no more than one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening, whichever is higher.
    3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
    4. Openings are to be not less than three inches in any direction in the plane of the wall. This requirement applies to the hole in the wall, excluding any device that may be inserted such as typical foundation air vent device.
    5. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
    6. The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
    7. The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
    8. Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structure’s originally approved design shall be presented as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.
E. Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent landfill in accordance with the following:
    1. The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than one foot deep before compacting to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with either the Standard or Modified Proctor Test method.
    2. The fill should extend at least 10 feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG.
    3. The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three horizontal to one vertical.
    4. The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
    5. The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.
F. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following requirements:
    1. The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site:
        a. Outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
        b. In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
        c. In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
        d. In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.
    2. The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood.
    3. Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in subsection D of this section.
    4. Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
    5. Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
        a. Be on site for less than 180 days; and
        b. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or
        c. Meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in this section. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(B).]

15.25.210 Standards for subdivision proposals.
A. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
B. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
C. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
D. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or five acres.
E. All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
F. All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders). [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(C).]

15.25.220 Critical facility.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(D).]

15.25.230 Standards for identified floodways.
Located within SFHAs, established in AMC 15.25.070, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving, etc., undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude nonsubstantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a nonboundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of nonsubstantial additions/improvements to residences in a nonboundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this article have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed which, acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the city shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(E).]

15.25.240 Standards for identified fringe.
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in this article have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(F).]

15.25.250 Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation and/or floodways/fringes.
A. Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the floodplain administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the floodplain administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in this article have been met.
B. Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the floodplain administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and one percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the floodplain administrator may issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions contained in this article have been met.
C. The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(G).]

15.25.260 Standards for flood-prone areas.
All development in known flood-prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per this article. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 5(H).]

    1. A showing of good and sufficient cause.
    2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship.

G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (see AMC 15.25.310).

B. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. [Ord. 8, 2012 § 6(E).]

15.25.320 Historic structure.
