PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hialeah, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Code, as supplemented through June 23, 1998, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE LDC:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE LDCCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT CODE INDEX LDCi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Daniel F. DeLoach, City Clerk, William M. Grodnick, City Attorney, and members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

But the city council may without referendum, upon request of the mayor and an affirmative vote of at least 5 councilmembers, authorize the sale of city owned vacant and unimproved land, not presently used as a park, and for which the council determines there is no future need for use as a park or any other public use, or the exchange of city real property, park or recreational area if the city receives real property that is greater in value than the city real property, park or recreational area exchanged, providing that there is a demonstrated public interest and purpose. Properties forfeited or foreclosed under state or federal laws or city ordinances are exempt from these provisions. Alleys, rights-of-way, easements or licenses are exempt from these provisions.

The city council shall have the power to reject all bids and advertise again. The city council may waive competitive bidding when it finds that it is impracticable or not advantageous to the city to do so. The city council, by ordinance not inconsistent with state law, may provide exceptions to competitive bidding requirements including but not limited to emergencies, monetary ceilings, contracts for professional services, sole source providers or credit facilities for certain types of purchases. 
(3)  Contracts involving the expenditure of city funds extending beyond the fiscal year. All contracts or agreements involving the expenditure of city funds extending beyond the fiscal year shall have a funding out or contingency clause based on the availability of funds. 
(4)  Contracts involving the expenditure of city funds not exceeding 5 years. The city council shall not approve any contracts or agreements that exceed 5 years involving the expenditure of city funds. The city council may provide options to renew contracts or agreements, providing that each renewal term does not exceed 5 years.

The existence of a disability incapacitating the elected mayor from performing the duties of the office shall be determined by an affirmative vote of at least 5 councilmembers based upon competent, substantial medical evidence.

In the general election held in November 2001 and in the general election in November every 4 years thereafter, 3 councilmembers shall be elected, from the city at large in groups numbered V through VII, who shall each be elected to serve for a term of 4 years or until a successor shall be duly qualified and take office. 
(c)  Vacancies. 
(1)  Permanent vacancy resulting from death, resignation, recall, court order or other lawful action. If a seat on the city council becomes permanently vacant by reason of death, resignation, recall, court order or other lawful action, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment, by resolution, of a qualified elector, who shall also satisfy the residency requirements for candidacy, by an affirmative vote of at least 4 councilmembers within 30 days of the occurrence of the vacancy. The appointee, who shall be known as an acting councilmember, shall exercise all authority of the office of councilmember, and shall perform the duties and assume the responsibilities of that office. The acting councilmember shall fill only that portion of the elected councilmember's term that precedes the next regularly scheduled municipal election or state or federal general election for which there is sufficient time to adopt a special election ordinance establishing qualifying periods and related provisions.

If the city council does not fill the vacancy within the prescribed 30 days, a special election shall be held at the earliest time permitted by law. The appointee, who shall be known as an acting councilmember, shall exercise all authority of the office of councilmember, and shall perform the duties and assume the responsibilities of that office. If the initially elected councilmember is returned to office, the initially elected councilmember shall automatically resume the duties of the office of councilmember for the balance of the elected term and the acting councilmember, whether appointed or elected pursuant to this section, shall cease to hold office. An appointed or elected acting councilmember, who assumes office after the council president becomes acting mayor, shall continue to serve so long as there is an acting mayor and otherwise complies with the requirements of office. The existence of a disability incapacitating the elected councilmember from the performance of the duties of the office shall be determined by an affirmative vote of at least 5 councilmembers based upon competent, substantial medical evidence. If death, resignation, recall, court order or other lawful action changes the temporary vacancy into a permanent vacancy, prior to the initial temporary vacancy having been filled, the now permanent vacancy will be filled according to the provisions of subparagraph 2.02(c)(1). If the temporary vacancy had already been filled, then the acting councilperson so appointed or elected would fill the permanent vacancy consistent with the procedure set forth in subparagraph 2.02(c)(1).

Special meetings may be called by the mayor or by at least 4 members of the city council. Written notice of special meetings must be given no less than 24 hours in advance to each councilmember, the mayor and the public, or such shorter time as a majority of the city council deems necessary in the event of an emergency affecting life, safety, health, welfare, property or the public peace.

(b)  Interference with administration. Except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations made in good faith, the city council or councilmembers shall deal with city officers and employees, who are subject to the direction and supervision of the mayor, solely through the mayor. Neither the city council nor councilmembers shall give orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or privately.

(c)  Holding other office. No elected city official shall hold any appointive city office, board membership or employment while in office, except as provided by state law.

Section 3.04. - Adoption of ordinance. 
(a)  Procedure, form. A proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and shall embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith. A proposed ordinance may be read by title, or in full, on at least 2 separate days and shall, at least 10 days prior to adoption, be noticed once in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality according to state law. The notice of proposed enactment shall state the date, time, and place of the meeting; the title or titles of proposed ordinances, and the place or places within the municipality where such proposed ordinances may be inspected by the public. The notice shall also advise that interested parties may appear at the meeting and be heard with respect to the proposed ordinance or ordinances. No ordinance shall be declared invalid by reason of any defect in publication or title if the published summary gives reasonable notice of its intent. At the time and place so advertised, or at any time and place, to which such public hearing may, from time to time, be adjourned, the ordinance shall be read by title and a public hearing shall be held. After the hearing, the city council may pass the ordinance with or without amendment. Except as provided elsewhere in the charter, an ordinance at first reading must receive at least 4 affirmative votes of councilmembers to proceed to public hearing on second or final reading. Except as provided for emergency ordinances or as provided elsewhere herein, an ordinance shall be adopted only by the affirmative vote of at least 4 councilmembers. 
(b)  Effective date, mayoral veto. All ordinances passed by the city council shall be submitted to the mayor for his or her approval before going into effect. If approved, the mayor may sign the ordinance and the ordinance, signed by the mayor, shall become law upon the mayor's signature. If an ordinance passed by the city council, and not signed by the mayor, is not returned to the city council by the mayor at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting, then the ordinance becomes effective, with the mayor's signature withheld, as if it were signed by the mayor. If disapproved, the mayor shall exercise the mayor's veto power and present a written veto message as the first order of business at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting. After presenting the veto message, the city council must consider, as the first order of business, sustaining or overriding the veto. An affirmative vote of at least 5 councilmembers is necessary to override the mayor's veto. If the vote to override is successful, then the ordinance becomes law, notwithstanding the mayor's objections. 
(c)  Penalties. Except where a specific penalty is imposed by Florida law or local building codes, a violation of any provision of an ordinance is a civil infraction carrying a maximum civil penalty not to exceed $500.00. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. 
(d)  Authority to codify ordinances. The city shall have the authority to codify its ordinances into a "city code" or "code of ordinances". If the city council intends to include an ordinance into the city code, then the adopting ordinance shall provide for inclusion in the city code. 
(e)  Repeal. Ordinances may be repealed by ordinance adopted in the same manner as the ordinance subject to repeal. The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinance in force before or at the time the repealed ordinance became effective. The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any punishment or penalty incurred before the repeal became effective. The repeal of an ordinance shall not affect any suit, prosecution or proceedings pending at the time of repeal for a violation committed under the ordinance repealed. 
(f)  Emergency ordinances. 
(1)  Authorization; form. To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, welfare, property or the public peace, the city council may adopt, in the manner provided in this subsection, one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not establish or amend the zoning designations or future land use map classifications of land parcels; change the list of permitted, conditional or prohibited uses within a zoning category; levy taxes; grant, renew or extend any municipal franchise; set service or user charges for any municipal services; or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided under the emergency appropriations provisions of this charter, if applicable. An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated in a preamble as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and specific terms. 
(2)  Procedure. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced. After its adoption by the unanimous vote of not less than 5 councilmembers, the ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other ordinances. 
(3)  Effective date. Emergency ordinances shall become effective upon adoption and signed by the mayor. 
(4)  Repeal. Every emergency ordinance, except emergency appropriation ordinances, shall automatically be repealed as of the 61st day following its effective date. If the emergency still exists, the ordinance may be extended or reenacted, in the same manner provided in this subsection or as a regular ordinance. An emergency ordinance may be repealed at any time by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner provided in this subsection. 
(g)  Emergency appropriations. The city council may make emergency appropriations in the same manner as other emergency ordinances. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the city council by emergency ordinance may authorize the issuance of emergency notes, renewable from time to time. But the emergency notes, including renewals, shall be payable not later than the last day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the original emergency appropriations ordinance was adopted.

(a)  Type II amusement machines shall each bear a sticker, at least three inches in diameter, which clearly and legibly says "play prohibited by minors."

After diligent search, the licensing administrator shall notify the owner, bona fide lien-holder and person in possession of the machine or machines at the time of seizure. Notice provided by certified mail must be mailed within 14 days after the seizure and must identify the procedure necessary to release the seized machine or machines. No machines so seized shall be released until the fee or business tax receipt and all storage and hauling and all other expenses have been paid in full. The hauling fee shall be $250.00 for each machine and the storage fee shall be $50.00 for each day for each machine in storage. 
(b)  When a type I or type II amusement machine seized pursuant to subsection (a) of this section has not been claimed by the owner thereof within 90 days from the date of such seizure, title to the unclaimed machine shall vest in the city. The city may elect to donate the machine to a charitable organization, sell or otherwise dispose of the machine. If the licensing administrator elects to sell any such machine at public sale, the city shall provide at least ten days' notice of the proposed sale date in writing to the owner, if the owner can be found, and advertise once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. All proceeds of the sale shall be credited to the general fund of the city and shall offset the fees, costs, and storage owed by the owner of the machines.

The amount of the security fund shall be the amount that the city determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that is necessary to protect the public, to provide adequate incentive to the franchisee to comply with this article and the franchise agreement, and to enable the city to effectively enforce compliance therewith, but in no event less than $200,000.00. The franchise agreement shall provide for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund. Neither the posting of the cash deposit or filing of an indemnity bond or any form of performance bond with the city, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the city thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the franchisee or limit the liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the fund or otherwise. 
(b)  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or authorized by other law or the franchise agreement, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have.

However, the City may subsequently require an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent construction, upgrade, rebuild or other work in the streets. 
(d)  The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a minimum rating acceptable to the risk manager and shall provide that this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.

Sec. 18-112. - Minimum facilities and services. 
(a)  The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all franchises granted by the city. The city may require in a franchise agreement that a franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where it determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the grant of the franchise, that the additional requirements are necessary to meet the future cable-related needs of the city and interests or to serve the public interest. 
(1)  Any cable system granted an initial franchise or a renewal of a franchise shall agree to construct a system with a minimum capacity of at least 750 MHz, including two-way capability as defined in section 18-101 hereof, or as set forth in a franchise agreement. The construction, rebuild, upgrade or reconstruction of any cable system must be completed within a 12-month construction schedule, unless such other time period is set forth in a franchise agreement. A franchise agreement may provide for a larger minimum channel capacity requirement as well as upgrades during the term of a franchise. 
(2)  The city may require in a franchise agreement that a franchisee provides access channels, facilities and other support for public, educational and/or governmental use, in excess of the minimum requirement of this article. 
(3)  A cable system shall provide leased access channels as required by federal law. 
(4)  Upon request or as specified in a franchise agreement, a franchisee shall, at minimum, provide at least one cable television service outlet and shall provide all basic and expanded basic cable services available on the cable system and, when technically feasible and available in the area from franchisee, or its affiliate, parent or subsidiary, serving subscribers within the area served by the system, at least one standard installation connection to a cable on-line service, including a minimum of at least one cable modem and on-line cable Internet service, to each public school (K-12) in the franchise area that are within 200 feet of the existing cable system and to which the franchisee has access. Franchisee shall charge no more than its time and material costs for any additional cable service outlets (including cable Internet service) to such facilities. 
(5)  A franchisee shall, upon request, provide at least one standard installation for basic and expanded basic cable service to each and every city government building within its franchise area that is passed by the cable system in the franchise area that are within 200 feet of the existing cable system and to which the franchisee has access at no charge to the city and shall charge no more than its costs for any additional basic cable service outlets to such facilities. 
(6)  A cable system shall include an "emergency alert" capability, which shall allow the mayor or designee, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to interrupt cable service, remotely override the audio of all channels on the cable system or to allow for video crawl over all channels. 
(7)  Standard installation shall consist of a drop not exceeding 125 feet from the cable plant to the nearest entry point of a subscriber's residence. Residential drops in excess of 125 feet may be charged according to franchisee's published rate schedule. 
(8)  The city may seek the use of a portion of the cable system's bandwidth for collecting data from subscribers for purposes including, but not limited to, a fire, police or other alarm system, or reading water meters pursuant to a separate agreement with the franchisee, provided that franchisee shall not be obligated to negotiate an agreement with the city for use of the system if the use of such system by the city is for services that are in competition with services offered or to be offered by the franchisee. 
(9)  A franchisee shall make available to its subscribers equipment capable of decoding closed circuit captioning information for the hearing impaired or in the alternative, franchisee shall provide information to subscribers on how and where to obtain such equipment. 
(10)  The cable system operator shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby powering for headend transportation and trunk amplifiers for a minimum of two hours. The equipment shall be constructed to automatically notify the cable office when it is in operation and to automatically revert to the standby mode when the AC power returns. All utility safety regulations must be followed to prevent a standby generator from powering the "dead" utility line, with possible injury to an unwitting lineperson. 
(b)  Most favored nation. Pursuant to the requirements of an initial or renewal franchise agreement or as otherwise agreed to pursuant to an agreement between the city and the franchisee, a franchisee shall provide, at a minimum, the same cable facilities and services to subscribers in the city as are available on any system serving subscribers in the City of Coral Gables, Florida, that is owned and operated by the franchisee, its parent, affiliate or subsidiary as of the date of this article. 
(c)  Conditions of service. Upon request and payment of all applicable charges and provided that the requesting person grants the franchisee access to that person's premises in order to furnish, maintain and continue to offer cable service to that person, a franchisee shall, throughout the term of a franchise, offer any person at that person's place of residence or place of business within the existing franchise area as of the date of this article, all cable services distributed over the cable system, except as otherwise set forth in a franchise agreement, subject to the installation charges set forth in paragraph (a)(7) above. If the city annexes any new areas from the date of this article, franchisee shall be required to provide cable service at standard installation rates to such area if there are at least 25 occupied homes for each mile and such location is not able to receive cable service by any other franchised cable operator. For areas not meeting the density and line extension requirements set forth in this subsection and section 18-112(a)(7), cable service may be made available on the basis of a subscriber's pro rata capital contribution in aid of construction not to exceed franchisee's costs of the labor, materials and easements required for the extension of its cable plant to serve such subscriber. Franchisee may require that such potential subscriber assume the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction in advance. 
(d)  Upon franchisee's acquisition of facilities in any city right-of-way, or upon the annexation to the city of any area in which franchisee owns or operates any facility, franchisee shall, at the city's request, submit to the city a statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise, permit, franchise or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such facilities to the extent franchisee has possession of such information. Such facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of franchisee's franchise granted hereunder.

The I-NET shall, at minimum, take into consideration the interconnection of all government and other public buildings as designated by the city, with minimum technical facilities as shall be specified subject to negotiation between the city and the franchisee and set forth in a franchise agreement. A franchisee may provide the city, subject to city approval, with an equivalent of an I-NET, based on current technology, or a capital grant in lieu of the obligation set forth herein. 
(f)  Where an I-NET already exists in the city, an applicant for an initial or renewal franchise shall provide the city with a capital grant in lieu of an Institutional Network as set forth in a franchise agreement.

(d)  The city may require any other tests as specified in a franchise agreement, or required by applicable law or regulation, or where there have been extensive complaints made, or where there exists other demonstrative evidence which in the reasonable judgment of the city casts doubt upon the reliability or technical quality of the cable system to be performed at the expense of the franchisee; provided that if the results of such tests indicate that franchisee is in compliance with the requirements of this article and/or the franchise agreement, the expenses reasonably incurred by the franchisee in conducting such tests shall be paid by the city. The franchisee shall provide the test results to the city within ten days of completion of the proof of performance or other tests. 
(e)  The franchisee shall provide the city ten days advance written notice when a proof of performance test required in subsections (c) and (d) above is scheduled, in order that the city may have an observer present.

However, the city's approval of any such plan shall be contingent upon franchisee's agreement to provide the city with appropriate time frames for compliance and appropriate remedies for the harm suffered due to franchisee's noncompliance. The city may grant extension of the time period herein, for good cause shown.

(e)  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the city of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable. 
(f)  Unless prohibited by applicable law, the franchise fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any other tax, fee or assessment. 
(g)  Unless prohibited by applicable law, the city may, from time to time, and upon reasonable notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due, and may re-compute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise, subject to the applicable statute of limitations.

To the extent that any notice requested by the city would exceed the messaging limitations of the franchisee's billing system and would thus cause the franchisee to print and insert a separate document in the bill, the city shall pay printing costs and incremental postage expenses for such notices. 
(3)  Franchisee bills shall be clear, concise and understandable to subscribers. 
(4)  Credits for service shall be issued no later than the next billing cycle of the customer following the determination that a credit is warranted.

The charge shall appear on the billing statement of the following month. If it is determined that a franchisee has assessed a late fee in violation of this section, the franchisee shall pay to subscribers that amount ordered by a governmental, court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction. Subscribers shall not be charged an administrative fee, a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made.

Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 18-302. - Sales or solicitations on the public right-of-way, stopping or parking to do business in one location. 
    A peddler or itinerant vendor cannot, as a result of any conduct related to his/her solicitation or sales, obstruct, delay, hinder, interfere with or impede the free flow of vehicular traffic on the roadways or pedestrian traffic on the sidewalks. A peddler or itinerant vendor soliciting or conducting sales on foot must observe all pedestrian traffic regulations. No peddler or itinerant vendor soliciting or conducting sales on foot can permanently stop or remain at any one location on public property; or private property (unless allowed for by zoning), for the purpose of soliciting, displaying goods, merchandise or wares, or conducting sales. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to authorize a peddler or itinerant vendor to stop or remain at any one location on private or public property with such regularity and permanency that would lead a reasonable person to believe the location is the vendor's fixed business location. 
    A peddler or itinerant vendor soliciting or engaging in sales of goods, merchandise or wares from a vehicle allowed to be safely operated on public roadways shall observe all rules of traffic. Prior to engaging in the sale of goods, merchandise or wares, the peddler or itinerant vendor must exit the roadway safely and properly park his/her vehicle in an area designated for parking. If parking on private property, the vendor must have the property owner's authorization. Once the sale or sales of goods, merchandise or wares have been completed, the peddler or itinerant vendor must return to circulate on the roadways if he or she intends to continue soliciting sales for the goods, merchandise or wares offered. A peddler or itinerant vendor soliciting or conducting sales of goods, merchandise or wares from a vehicle cannot permanently stop or park at any one location on public or private property for the purpose of soliciting from their vehicle, advertising or displaying their goods merchandise or wares from their vehicle or conducting sale of goods merchandise or wares from their vehicle. A peddler or itinerant vendor operating from a vehicle must continuously drive their vehicle on the roadways in order to solicit, advertise or display their goods merchandise or wares. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to authorize a peddler or itinerant vendor operating from a vehicle to stop or park at any one location on private or public property with such regularity and permanency such that would lead a reasonable person to believe the location is the vendor's fixed business location. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a vendor has established a fixed business location in violation of this section if the vehicle is stopped or parked at any one location on private or public property for a period of time exceeding thirty minutes when no sales are taking place, the goods, merchandise or wares are on display and the vendor is advertising or soliciting sales. The peddler or itinerant vendor shall not utilize any artifice or scheme to circumvent the intent of this section.

The notice shall be published at least ten days in advance of the drawing. All interested applicants shall register for the drawing in a form and pursuant to the procedures adopted by the city. The business tax administrator shall create a list of interested applicants in the order in which their names are drawn to establish the priority in which the interested applicant's application shall be processed for approval and awarded a license. The business tax administrator shall not accept applications from interested applicants, as ranked, in excess of the available number of licenses available to be issued. 
(c)  The winner(s) of the drawing shall complete a business tax application form and return the completed form with all information required to the business tax division within 60 days of selection. The applicant must comply with all applicable code requirements to operate as secondhand goods dealer at the proposed location, including but not limited to, all applicable requirements under this article, chapter 86, and all other zoning, building and fire code requirements. If the application is denied, the business tax administrator can accept an application from the next interested applicant in the order of their ranking from the list created as a result of the drawing once all administrative appeals have been exhausted by the rejected applicant. If the list of interested applicants is exhausted, the business tax administrator must conduct another drawing in order to establish an eligibility list.

    Code means any of the several chapters of the City of Hialeah Code of Ordinances, or any other code, ordinance or rule duly adopted by the city council, which codes may be cited either by the section number from the City of Hialeah Code of Ordinances, or by the section numbers in the Miami Dade County Code, building code, fire codes or other technical codes that city is authorized to enforce within its jurisdiction.

    Continuing violation means any violation that remains uncorrected beyond the reasonable time period established for correction contained in either the notice of civil violation or the final order of the special master, whichever is applicable.

    Uncorrectable or irreparable violation means a violation which cannot be remedied after the violation was committed because the violation constitutes a single prohibited act rather than an ongoing condition or circumstance.

Penalties for continuing violations may be imposed by the special master and continue accruing after the date for correction given by the special master's order has run. 
(e)  For a repeat violation, the amount of the civil penalty shall be double the amount of penalty prescribed for the original violation. A repeat violation which remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction in the notice of civil violation shall be treated as a continuing violation. A repeat violation can occur only after correction of the original violation has been documented by the code inspector. 
(f)  Civil penalties assessed pursuant to this section are due and payable to the city on or before the last day of the period allowed for the filing of an administrative hearing request, or for the filing of an appeal from a special master's order, or if a proper appeal is made, when the appeal has been adjudged adversely to the violator. 
(Ord. No. 2018-017, § 1, 2-27-2018) 
State Law reference- Schedule of fines, F.S. § 162.21(5). 
Sec. 22-185. - Rights of violators; payment of fine; right to appeal; failure to pay and correct. 
(a)  A violator who has been served with a notice of civil violation shall elect either to: 
(1)  Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the notice of civil violation and correct the violation within the time specified on the notice of civil violation, if applicable; or 
(2)  Request an administrative hearing before a special master to contest the determination of the code inspector which resulted in the issuance of the notice of civil violation. 
(b)  If the violator corrects the violation within the specified time and pays the applicable civil penalty, then the matter that gave rise to the issuance of the notice of civil violation shall be terminated and the case shall be closed. 
(c)  A request for administrative hearing shall be accomplished by filing a request in writing with the code enforcement clerk or by mailing the written request to the code enforcement clerk or designee to the address indicated on the notice of civil violation not later than 15 calendar days after the service of the notice of civil violation. If the written request is mailed, the alleged violator shall have 20 calendar days from the service of the notice of civil violation for the code compliance clerk or designee to receive the written request. The named violator, upon compliance, may request an administrative hearing if the violator seeks to contest the amount of the fine stated in the notice of civil violation. 
(d)  If the named violator, after notice, fails to pay the civil penalty and/or correct the violation within the time specified, if applicable, or fails to timely request an administrative hearing before a special master, such failure shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing before the special master. A waiver of the right to administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation, and penalties shall be assessed accordingly. 
(e)  If the owner of the property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the special master transfers ownership of such property between the time the notice of civil violation was served and the time of the administrative hearing, the property owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the notice of civil violation, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the property owner. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the code and all orders entered pursuant to this chapter 22. 
(4)  File a notice with the code compliance official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer, and/or failure to file a notice with the code enforcement official creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the administrative hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the administrative hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 2018-017, § 1, 2-27-2018) 
Sec. 22-186. - Conduct of administrative hearing. 
(a)  Upon receipt of the code inspector or a named violator's timely request for an administrative hearing pursuant to this division, the code enforcement clerk or designee shall set the matter down for hearing on the next available regularly scheduled hearing date or as soon thereafter as possible in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  The code compliance clerk or designee shall send a notice of hearing to the violator and to the property owner, if different from the violator, in compliance with section 22-189. The notice of hearing shall include the following: 
(1)  The name of the code inspector who issued the notice of civil violation; 
(2)  A factual description of the alleged violation; 
(3)  The date of the alleged violation was observed by the code inspector; 
(4)  The section number or description of the code allegedly violated; 
(5)  The place, date and time of the administrative hearing; 
(6)  Notice of the right of the violator to be represented by an attorney; 
(7)  Notice of the right of the violator to present witnesses and evidence and to cross examine witnesses; and 
(8)  Notice that failure of the violator to attend the administrative hearing may result in civil penalty, continuing violation penalties and administrative costs being assessed against the violator. 
(c)  The special master shall conduct the administrative hearings on a regularly scheduled basis. No hearing shall be set sooner than 30 days from the date of service of the notice of civil violation unless as so provided in this section. 
(d)  All administrative hearings before the special master shall be open to the public. All testimony shall be under oath. If proper notice has been given, a hearing may proceed in the absence of the named violator. 
(e)  The proceedings at the administrative hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the expense of the party requesting the transcript. 
(f)  Each case before a special master shall be presented by the code compliance official, code inspector and/or designee. 
(g)  The administrative hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the formal rules relating to evidence and witnesses, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if the special master finds it competent and reliable, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. 
(h)  Each party shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination, to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify and to offer rebuttal evidence. 
(i)  The special master shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law based on the evidence presented. 
(j)  Based upon the findings made by the special master, the decision of the code inspector shall either be affirmed or reversed. 
(1)  In order to affirm the decision of the code inspector, the special master must find that the greater weight of the evidence shows the existence of a code violation and that the named violator committed or was responsible for the violation. 
(2)  If the special master reverses the decision of the code inspector and finds the named violator not responsible for the code violation alleged in the notice of civil violation, the named violator shall not be liable for the payment of any civil penalty, continuing violation penalties or administrative hearing costs, absent reversal of the special master's findings pursuant to section 22-188. 
(3)  The special master may also modify the decision of the code inspector as to the time for correction contained in the notice of civil violation. The time for correction given by the code inspector to the named violator in the notice of civil violation is presumed to be reasonable but may be rebutted by the violator. Upon presentation of relevant evidence by the named violator that the time for correction was not reasonable, the special master may make determination as to reasonableness of the time for correction contained in the notice of civil violation. If the special master determines that the time given for correction was insufficient, the penalty for a continuing violation shall be calculated from the date determined by the special master to be a reasonable date for correction. 
(k)  The special master may, for good cause shown, postpone or continue an administrative hearing. 
(l)  If the violator is found guilty of the violation, the violator may be held liable for the administrative hearing cost in the amount of $150.00. 
(m)  If the decision of the special master is to affirm the code inspector's determination of violation, the following elements may be included in the special master's final order: 
(1)  The amount of the civil penalty, including applicable continuing violation penalties plus any other applicable costs incurred by the city; 
(2)  Administrative costs of the hearing in the amount of $150.00; and 
(3)  The date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent resumption of continuing violation penalties, if applicable. 
(n)  The special master shall be bound by the interpretations and decisions of the duly authorized city and county boards of appropriate jurisdiction concerning the provisions within their respective jurisdictions. 
(o)  The code inspector, special master or the named violator may request that witnesses and records, including surveys, plats and other materials, be subpoenaed to any formal hearings. Subpoenas may be served by officers of the police department or other such persons authorized to deliver subpoenas. The city clerk shall provide sufficient signed and blank witness and document subpoena forms to the named violator and the code inspector for the purpose of having witnesses and records subpoenaed. The violator shall pay to the city a fee for each subpoena served. 
(p)  If the violator fails to correct the violation by the date set for compliance in the special master's order and/or pay for the civil penalties, continuing violation penalties and any other costs assessed by the special master in compliance with section 22-184, the code inspector shall serve on the violator a notice of non-compliance and intent to file a lien. The violator may contest the code inspector's finding of non-compliance and the imposition of the lien by requesting an administrative hearing before a special master in compliance with section 22-185 within 15 days after service of the notice of non-compliance and intent to file the lien. If the violator fails to request the administrative hearing, the violator shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the finding of non-compliance and imposition of the lien, and such waiver shall constitute an admission of non-compliance with the special master's order. The city may proceed to record a certified copy of the special master's order in compliance with section 22-187 without any further action from the special master. 
(1)  Upon receipt of a named violator's timely request for an administrative hearing, pursuant to this section, the code enforcement clerk or designee shall set the matter down for hearing on the next available regularly scheduled hearing date or as soon as possible thereafter. 
(2)  The code enforcement clerk or designee shall send a notice of hearing to the violator in compliance with section 22-189. The notice of hearing shall include the following: 
(i)  A reference to the order of the special master that continues to be violated; 
(ii)  Date and issuance of affidavit of non-compliance; 
(iii)  The name of the code inspector who inspected the property and prepared the affidavit of non-compliance; 
(iv)  The place, date and time of the administrative hearing; 
(v)  Notice of the right of the violator to be represented by an attorney; 
(vi)  Notice of the right of the violator to present witnesses and evidence and to cross examines witnesses; 
(vii)  Notice that failure of the violator to attend the administrative hearing may result in civil penalty and administrative costs being assessed against the violator; 
(viii)  Notice that the fines continue to accrue while the administrative hearing is pending, and that if the violator is not successful at the hearing fines will accrue retroactive to the deadline of the original order; 
(ix)  Notice that the administrative hearing is strictly limited to whether and when the violator complied with the order of the special master; and 
(x)  Notice that the violator may be responsible for the administrative costs of the hearing in the amount of $150.00 if the violator is unsuccessful at the hearing. 
(Ord. No. 2018-017, § 1, 2-27-2018) 
Sec. 22-187. - Recovery of unpaid civil penalties; lien for unpaid penalty; foreclosure and other relief. 
(a)  The city may institute proceedings in a circuit court to compel payment of civil penalties and to compel compliance, make repairs and other equitable and injunctive relief. 
(b)  A certified copy of any order imposing a civil penalty or a civil penalty plus administrative costs may be recorded in the county public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land upon which the violation exists or existed or upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien that remains unpaid, the city may foreclose on or otherwise execute the lien. No lien created pursuant to this chapter may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the Florida Constitution. In any action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable costs of repairs incurred by the city to bring the property into compliance. 
(c)  No lien provided under this section shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on a lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying the lien. 
(d)  The violator, or the violator's successor or assign, who has an ownership interest in the property encumbered by the recorded order of the special master may file a request for a reduction of fines before the special master only after an inspection is conducted by the city and a code inspector finds that all violations were corrected. Upon receipt of a written request for a reduction, and the filing of an affidavit of partial compliance by the code inspector, the code compliance official shall set the matter for penalty reduction hearing by the special master. However, if the city has commenced action to obtain compliance with the order of the special master, including but not limited to an action for injunctive relief, foreclosure, or money judgment, no reduction hearing shall be held. No request for a reduction of civil penalties may be accepted or processed unless the code violations on the subject property have been corrected. 
(e)  At the hearing, the findings of the special master shall be limited to evidence establishing: 
(1)  Good cause for a reduction of the civil penalty, and 
(2)  The amount of the reduction. 
    Said hearing shall not be an opportunity to appeal any findings of fact or conclusions of law set forth in any prior order of the special master or any administrative determination of the city. 
(f)  In determining good cause, and the amount of the reduction, if any, the special master shall consider: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; 
(3)  Any previous, or other outstanding violations whether committed by the violator, or pertaining to the property to which the lien attaches, unless an order finding a violation is under appeal at the time of the determination; 
(4)  Whether the violation is uncorrectable, irreparable or irreversible in nature; 
(5)  Whether the violator's failure to timely comply with an order of the special master is due to an inability to comply based on factors beyond the control of the violator; and 
(6)  Any equitable considerations raised by the violator or the city relating to the amount of the reduction. 
(g)  Upon a finding of good cause, the special master has the sole discretion to grant or deny the request for a reduction of civil penalty according to the following guidelines: 
(1)  If compliance occurs within three months of the date for compliance set forth in the order of the special master; a maximum reduction of 95 percent of the total amounts owed to the city, which includes the original civil penalty, continuing civil penalties, any applicable costs, interests and fees assessed; 
(2)  If compliance occurs more than three months but less than 12 months from the compliance date, a maximum reduction of 75 percent of the total amounts owed to the city, which includes the original civil penalty, continuing civil penalties, any applicable costs, interests and fees assessed; 
(3)  If compliance occurs from 12 months to 18 months of the compliance date; a maximum of 50 percent of the total amounts owed to the city, which includes the original civil penalty, continuing civil penalties, any applicable costs, interests and fees assessed; and 
(4)  If compliance occurs more than 18 months after the compliance date, a maximum of 25 percent of the total amounts owed to the city, which includes the original civil penalty, continuing civil penalties, any applicable costs, interests and fees assessed. 
(h)  The special master has the authority where there is a demonstrated showing of financial hardship or other good cause to reduce the civil penalty below the civil penalty reduction guidelines included above. The special master shall exercise this authority with great caution and only in documented and exceptional circumstances. A violator alleging financial hardship has the burden of presenting evidence of inability to pay the civil penalty. In no event shall the fine be reduced below the amount of the original fine plus the costs incurred by the city in its prosecution of the code violations. The special master shall not waive or reduce any administrative fees previously ordered to be paid. The violator shall be responsible for the administrative hearing cost in the amount of $150.00. 
(i)  If the amounts owed to the city are reduced, the order of the special master shall provide that if the violator fails to pay the reduced amount by the date ordered, then the original amounts owed shall be automatically reinstated. The special master may impose conditions on the granting of a request for reduction and may allow additional hearings upon request if necessary to establish compliance with said conditions before an order reducing the amounts owed is entered. 
(j)  Upon receipt of timely payment in full of the reduced amount, and the recording costs, the city shall record a copy of the order reducing the penalties and a satisfaction or release of lien. 
(k)  A request for a reduction hearing shall include a waiver of the right, if any, to seek judicial review of the special master's decision whether or not to reduce the fine and if so, by how much. A reduction of civil penalty may only be granted once as to any violation of an order of the special master. If a reduction is denied based upon the merits of the claim, such denial shall be with prejudice and the matter shall not be reconsidered. 
(l)  Liens arising from a fine imposed pursuant to a violation of chapter 38, chapter 54 and chapter 86 of the code are ineligible for reduction. 
(Ord. No. 2018-017, § 1, 2-27-2018) 
Sec. 22-188. - Appeals of orders of special masters. 
(a)  An aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final order of a special master by filing a petition for certiorari with the circuit court, appellate division. Such appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the special master. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of issuance of the order by the special master sought to be overturned. 
(b)  Failure to make such appeal within the prescribed 30-day period and in the absence of reversal of a special master's ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction acting in an appellate capacity, the findings of the special master shall be conclusive, binding and final, and such findings shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect unpaid penalties or for equitable or injunctive relief. 
(c)  No aggrieved party other than the city may apply to the court for relief unless such party has first exhausted the remedies provided for in this article and has taken all available steps provided in this chapter; and no application shall be made by any aggrieved party other than the city to a court for relief except from an order imposing fines or assessing continuing fines issued by the special master pursuant to this chapter. It is the intention of the city that, notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the city shall retain all rights and remedies otherwise available to it to secure compliance with or prevent violations of the code. 
(Ord. No. 2018-017, § 1, 2-27-2018) 
Sec. 22-189. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required under this chapter including notice of civil violations and notices of administrative hearing must be provided to the violator and property owner, if different from the violator by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices or to the address listed in the county property appraiser's database. For property owned by a corporation, notice may be provided by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the registered agent of the corporation. If any notice is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by publication and/or posting as described in subsections (b) and (c) below; 
(2)  Hand delivery to the violator by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector or designated agent acting by and through the code inspector; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is 15 years of age or older and informing such person of the contents of the notice; 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, notice may be served by leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) hereof, at the option of the code inspector, law enforcement officer or other person designated by the city, notice may also be served by publication, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements; 
(2)  Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051; 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with or may follow an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  In lieu of publication, and under the circumstances set forth in subsection (a)(1) hereof, such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice of civil violation, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice of civil violation or notice of hearing, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice of civil violation or notice of hearing posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(d)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsections (b) and (c) above, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this chapter have been met, without regard to whether or not the named violator actually received such notice.

(f)  If (1) the proposed fire rescue assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the rates of assessment adopted by the city including a maximum assessment rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 38-223 and 38-224 hereof, (2) the purpose for which the fire rescue assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the fire rescue assessment is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 38-223 and 38-224 hereof, (3) assessed property is reclassified or the method of apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased fire rescue assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 38-223 and 38-224 hereof, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform to the notice requirements set forth in sections 38-223 and 38-224 hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the annual rate ordinance.

Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims, until paid. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be deemed perfected upon the city's adoption of the final assessment ordinance or the annual rate ordinance, whichever is applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll.

    If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city is satisfied that any such fire rescue assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll, which property should have been so included, the city may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire rescue assessment against any property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case such second fire rescue assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city may obtain and impose other fire rescue assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, § 1, 6-10-2008) 
Sec. 38-230. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any information or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire rescue assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby.

Sec. 38-231. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, mayor, city council, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue assessment imposed by the city. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed pursuant to this article against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual rate ordinance for any upcoming fiscal year, the city may, upon provision of a notice by mail provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section 38-224, impose the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such fire rescue assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as provided in division 2 hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the ordinance imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments. 
(c)  Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector according to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the mayor shall have the authority at any time, upon the mayor's own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire rescue assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the mayor and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector according to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the mayor. 
(Ord. No. 2008-52, § 1, 6-10-2008) 
Sec. 38-232. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim fire rescue assessment may be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after the adoption of the annual rate ordinance. The amount of the interim fire rescue assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed according to the annual rate ordinance for the fiscal year for which the interim fire rescue assessment is being imposed. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim fire rescue assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire rescue assessment. 
(b)  Issuance of the certificate of occupancy without the payment in full of the interim fire rescue assessment shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire rescue assessment not collected prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 38-240 hereof, under the alternative collection method provided in section 38-241 or by any other method authorized by law. 
(c)  Any interim fire rescue assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Such lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 42-26. - Definitions. 
    In constructing the sections of this article, where the context will permit and no definition is provided in this section, the definitions provided in F.S. ch. 403 and in the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as may be amended from time to time, shall apply. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this article or a review of a grant or denial of a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This term is synonymous with the phrase "special flood hazard area." 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood" and the "regulatory flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this article. 
    Base flood elevation means the water-surface elevation associated with the base flood. 
    Basement means any portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building. See "structure." 
    Datum means a reference surface used to ensure that all elevation records are properly related. The current national datum is the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, which is expressed in relation to mean sea level, or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
    Elevated building means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by foundation walls, posts, piers, columns, pilings, or shear walls. 
    Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction means, for the purposes of floodplain management, structures for which "the start of construction" commenced before September 29, 1972. 
    Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 29, 1972. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means: 
(a)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
(1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(b)  The collapse or subsidence of land along a shore of a lake or other body of water as the result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this definition. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map of the community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has delineated the areas of special flood hazard and regulatory floodways. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of the community, issued by FEMA, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been identified as only approximate zone A. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by FEMA, which delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official hydrology and hydraulics report provided by FEMA. The study contains an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and other flood-related erosion hazards. The study may also contain flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FHBM (where applicable), and other related data and information. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding"). 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations of the community. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, State of Florida, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    Flood proofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Freeboard means the additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet, above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors, such as wave action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed, which could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
    Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Hardship as related to variances from this article means the exceptional difficulty associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The community requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register: 
(a)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(b)  Individually listed on the Florida inventory of historic places, which has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(c)  Individually listed on the city inventory of historic places through the city historic preservation board. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after the completion of construction, of the ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design standards of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, which is the property value excluding the land value and that of the detached accessory structures and other improvements on site (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller) as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by an independent certified appraisal (other than a limited or curbside appraisal, or one based on income approach), actual cash value (replacement cost depreciated for age and quality of construction of building), or adjusted tax-assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after September 29, 1972. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For flood insurance rates, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after September 29, 1972 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the first floodplain management code, ordinance or standard. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Program deficiency means a defect in the community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations or of the standards required by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
    Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to safety or health of the entire community or a neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    Reasonably safe from flooding means base floodwaters will not inundate the land or damage structures to be removed from the SFHA and that any subsurface waters related to the base flood will not damage existing or proposed buildings. 
    Recreational vehicle means a vehicle that is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis; 
(b)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(c)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    Remedy a deficiency or violation means to bring the regulation, procedure, structure or other development into compliance with state, federal or local floodplain management regulations; or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways the impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    Shallow flooding. See "area of shallow flooding." 
    Special flood hazard area. See "area of special flood hazard." 
    Start of construction means, for other than new construction and substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P.L. 97-348, includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for permit for improvement, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. This term does not include any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the requirements of this article. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    X-zone means an area of minimum or moderate flood hazard above the base flood elevation, which does not meet the criteria of a special flood hazard area. For purposes of this chapter, base flood elevation in an X-zone shall be equivalent to the elevation of the crown of the road or back of sidewalk abutting a property plus eight inches for residential and four inches for nonresidential properties, whichever is higher. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-27. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  Such flood losses are caused in part by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. Such flood losses are caused in part by uses in flood hazard areas vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-28. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to save lives, promote public health, safety and general welfare, and minimum public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to life, health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(b)  The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life, health and to eliminate or minimize property damage; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and culverts located in floodplains; 
(6)  Maintain a stable tax base by providing for the responsible use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-29. - Application of this article; compliance; interpretation; designation of floodplain administrator. 
(a)  This article applies to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city. The provisions of this article shall be considered minimum standards and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this article and other provisions of the Code conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(b)  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the flood insurance study (FIS) for the city dated September 11, 2009, with the accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any subsequent revisions thereof, are adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The flood insurance study and flood insurance rate map are on file in the planning division. 
(c)  The building official is the floodplain administrator and in that capacity, is empowered to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
(d)  A development permit in compliance with the provisions herein shall be required prior to commencing any development activities. No structure or land shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the provisions of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-30. - Warning and liability disclaimer. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 42-40. - Permit procedures. 
    Application for a development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by the city prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing and proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(a)  Application stage: 
(1)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all buildings; 
(2)  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential building will be flood proofed; 
(3)  Certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential flood proofed building will meet the flood proofing criteria in subsection (b) herein and section 42-51(b) hereof; 
(4)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and 
(b)  Construction stage: Upon placement of the lowest floor, or flood proofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator a certification of the NGVD or NAVD elevation of the lowest floor or flood proofed elevation in relation to mean sea level. Such certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by surveyor or professional engineer. When flood proofing is utilized for a particular building, the certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by professional engineer or architect. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and flood proofing elevation survey data submitted. The permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed shall correct violations detected by such review. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-41. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    Duties of the floodplain administrator shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  Review permits to assure sites are reasonably safe from flooding; 
(b)  Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied;

(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-51. - Specific standards. 
    In areas of special flood hazard or within X-zones, residential and nonresidential, the following provisions are required: 
(a)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than eight inches above the base flood elevation, the crown of the road, or back of sidewalk elevation abutting the property, whichever is greater. If solid foundation perimeter walls are used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the equalization of hydrostatic forces on two sides of exterior walls in according to the standards of subsection (c) herein. 
(b)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement elevated no lower than four inches above the base flood elevation, the crown of the road, or back of sidewalk elevation abutting the property, whichever is greater. Buildings located in all A-zones may be flood proofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 42-42(a)(3). An operational plan shall be included to describe the installation of the flood proofing measures. 
(c)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to exclude accessory buildings from this article. 
(d)  Enclosures below the lowest floor. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
(1)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
b.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above adjacent interior grade; and 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided that such openings provide the required net area of the openings and permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(2)  Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, storage, and building access. Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door), limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door), or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
(3)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms. 
(e)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles must either: 
(1)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
(2)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
(3)  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation standards according to section 42-51(d)(1) and (2). 
(f)  Adequate drainage paths around structures shall be provided on slopes to guide water away from structures within zone AH. 
(g)  Standards for waterways with established base flood elevations, but without regulatory floodways located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-29(b), where streams exist for which base flood elevation data has been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) without the delineation of the regulatory floodway (zones AE and A1-30). The following provisions, in addition to those set forth in sections 42-51(a) through (e) shall apply: 
(1)  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development including fill shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(2)  Development activities that increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, with the community's endorsement, for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of FEMA. 
(h)  Standards for waterways with established base flood elevations and floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-29(b), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the high velocity of flood waters that carry debris, potential projectiles and have significant erosion potential, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in sections 42-51(a) through (e) shall apply: 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments within the regulatory floodway unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice demonstrating that encroachments would not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  Development activities including new construction and substantial improvements within the regulatory floodway that increase the base flood elevation may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, with the community's endorsement, for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of FEMA. 
(3)  When fill is proposed, according to the permit issued by the state department of health, within the regulatory floodway, the development permit shall be issued only upon demonstration by appropriate engineering analyses that the proposed fill will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood according to section 42-51(g)(1). 
(i)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
(1)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or in substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction, including elevation and anchoring. 
(2)  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially improved must meet the standards of section 42-51(a) and (e). 
(j)  Specific standards for A-zones without base flood elevations and regulatory floodways located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-29(b) where there exist A zones for which no base flood elevation data and regulatory floodway have been provided or designated by FEMA. The following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Require standards of section 42-50 hereof. 
(2)  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data. Standards set forth in section 42-51 hereof shall apply. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or any other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. When such data is utilized, provisions of section 42-51 hereof shall apply. The floodplain administrator shall: 
a.  Obtain the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
b.  Obtain, if the structure has been flood proofed according to the requirements of section 42-51(b), the elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the structure has been flood proofed; and 
c.  Maintain a record of all such information. 
(4)  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities, the state department of community affairs, NFIP coordinating office, and the South Florida Water Management District prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
(5)  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. Such homes must be elevated and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  When the data is not available from any source, according to the standards set forth in section 42-51(j), the lowest floor of the structure shall be elevated to no lower than three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Standards set forth in section 42-51 shall apply.

(a)  An affected property owner or person may apply for a variance of the standards or provisions of this article on a form submitted by the city together with an application fee of $150.00. 
(b)  Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building variances shall only be issued when there is: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this article, and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(d)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any impact in flood conditions or increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(e)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance or denial, and report such variances in the community's NFIP Biennial Report or upon request to FEMA and the state department of community affairs, NFIP coordinating office. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-62. - Variance notification. 
    The floodplain administrator shall provide written notice to the applicant to whom a variance is granted that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the county public records in a form so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
(Ord. No. 2009-102, § 1, 12-22-2009)

Sec. 42-64. - Calculation of substantial improvement and damage. 
(a)  Substantial improvement. An addition or renovation shall be considered a substantial improvement when the costs of improving the structure exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building: 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the costs of improvements for a project shall be obtained from one of the following sources: 
a.  Detailed cost estimate from the licensed general contractor of record; or 
b.  Professional construction estimation software, such as Marshall and Swift or the FEMA residential substantial damage estimation program. 
(2)  For the purposes of this section, the following sources will be considered acceptable estimates of market value: 
a.  An independent appraisal by a professional appraiser. The appraisal must exclude the value of the land and not use the "income capitalization approach", which bases value on the use of the property, not the structure. 
b.  Property appraisals used for tax assessment purposes with an adjustment recommended by the county property appraiser to reflect market conditions (adjusted assessed value). 
(3)  For structures in which the substantial improvement percentage is greater than or equal to 40 percent, a more precise market value may be required. 
(b)  Substantial damage. Damage to a structure, including damage from demolition, in which the cost to repair exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building: 
(1)  Cost to repair a structure shall be calculated for full repair to the building before damage condition, even when the owner elects not to restore the building to its prior state. Cost to repair shall also include the cost of any improvement that the owner has opted to include during the repair project. For the purposes of this section, the cost to repair shall be obtained from one of the following objective third party sources: 
a.  A licensed general contractor; 
b.  Professional construction estimation software, such as Marshall and Swift or the FEMA residential substantial damage estimation program; 
c.  Insurance adjustment papers; or 
d.  Damage assessment field surveys conducted by building inspection, emergency management or tax assessment agencies after a disaster. 
(2)  For structures in which the substantial damage percentage is greater than or equal to 40 percent, a more precise market value may be required. 
(c)  Exclusions regarding substantial improvement. The term substantial improvement shall not, however, include alteration of historic structures provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURES 

Sec. 46-66. - Designation process and procedure. 
(a)  Designated areas. The historic preservation board shall have the authority to designate areas, places, buildings, structures, landscape features, archaeological and paleontological sites and other improvements or physical features as individual sites, districts, or archaeological and paleontological zones that are significant in the city's history, architecture, archaeology, paleontology or culture and that possess an integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship or association or that: 
(1)  Are associated with distinctive elements of the cultural, social, political, economic, scientific, religious, prehistoric and architectural history that have contributed to the pattern of history in the community, the city, the county, South Florida, the state or the nation. 
(2)  Are associated with the lives of persons significant in the city's past. 
(3)  Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, style or method of construction or work of a master or possess high artistic value or represent a distinguishable entity whose components may lave individual distinction. 
(4)  Have yield or are likely to yield information in history or prehistory. 
(5)  Are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
(b)  Properties not normally considered for designation. Certain properties, which include cemeteries, birthplaces, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, properties commemorative in nature and properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years, will not normally be considered for designation. However, such properties may qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories: 
(1)  A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction of historical importance. 
(2)  A building or structure removed from its location but which is primarily significant for architectural value or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with an historic event or person. 
(3)  A birthplace or grave of an historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building directly associated with such person's productive life. 
(4)  A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, distinctive design features, or from association with historic events. 
(5)  A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical significance. 
(6)  A property or district achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance. 
(7)  A property listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
(c)  Investigation and report. Prior to the designation of an individual site, a district, or an archaeological or paleontological zone, an investigation and designation report must be filed with the historic preservation board. The format of these reports may vary according to the type of designation; however, all reports must address the following: the historical, cultural, architectural, and archaeological or paleontological significance of the property being recommended for designation; a recommendation of boundaries for districts and archaeological or paleontological zones and identification of boundaries of individual being designated; a recommendation of standards to be adopted by the board in carrying out its regulatory function under this chapter with respect to certificates of appropriateness and certificates to dig. Where a report is filed recommending designation of a district, the report must identify those properties, if any, within the district that are not historically or architecturally compatible with structures in the district. The standards for regulating such nonconforming properties shall provide that a certificate of appropriateness may be required only for new construction on such properties. All reports shall take into consideration projected, proposed or existing public improvements and developmental or renewal plans. 
(d)  Procedure. Procedures for designation or for de-designation shall be as follows: 
(1)  Petition. The owner of any property in the city, the city, the director of the county office of historic preservation and a private party may petition the board for designation of the owner's property as an individual site, district, archaeological or paleontological zone, provided that the owner appears before the board with sufficient information to warrant the investigation of the property for future designation and the board finds that the property may be worthy of designation or de-designation. The board shall, based on its findings, either direct staff to begin the designation process or deny the petition. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to restrict the power of the board to initiate the designation or de-designation process. 
(2)  Directive of board. The board shall, upon recommendation from staff and/or the acceptance of petitions pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section or upon its own initiative, direct staff to begin the designation process by preparing a designation or de-designation report, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and any other standards the board may deem necessary, and submitting this report, according to the procedures described in this section. 
(3)  Notification of owner. For each proposed designation of an individual site, district or archaeological or paleontological zone, the board shall attempt to obtain the consent to designation of the property owner involved and shall mail a copy of the designation or de-designation report to each owner at least 15 days prior to filing of a designation or de-designation report with the board as notification of the intent of the board to consider designation or de-designation of the property. The property owner's consent is not necessary for the city to designate an historic property for historic preservation or de-designate a property. 
(4)  Notification of government agencies. Upon filing of a designation or de-designation report, the secretary of the board shall immediately notify the building and planning divisions, and any other agency or department, including agencies or departments with demolition powers, that may be affected by such filing, including, but not limited to, the director of the county office of historic preservation. 
(5)  Notification of public hearing. For each individual site, district or archaeological or paleontological zone proposed for designation, a public hearing must be held no sooner than 15 days and within 60 days from the date a designation or de-designation report has been filed with the board. Owners of record, petitioners or other parties having an interest in the proposed designated properties, if known, shall be notified of the public hearing by certified mail to the last known addresses of the parties being served; however, failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the notice, as such notice shall also be perfected by publishing a copy thereof in a newspaper of general circulation at least ten days prior to the hearing. Owners shall be given an opportunity at the public hearing to object to the proposed designation or de-designation. 
(6)  Prompt decision and notification. Within seven days of a public hearing on a proposed individual site, district or archaeological or paleontological zone, the board shall reduce to writing its decision to approve, deny or amend the proposed designation or de-designation and direct the secretary of the board to notify the following of its actions with a copy of the official minutes of the meeting and a summary statement of the effects of this action: 
a.  The building division. 
b.  The city clerk. 
c.  Owners of the affected property and other parties having an interest in the property, if known. 
d.  The planning division. 
e.  Any other city agency, including agencies with demolition powers, that may be affected by this action, including, but not limited to, county office of historic preservation. 
(7)  Amendment of designation. The board may amend or rescind any designation or de-designation provided it complies with the procedures used in the original designation. 
(8)  Moratorium. Upon the filing of a designation or de-designation report by the staff, the owner of the real property that is the subject matter of the designation report shall not: 
a.  Erect any structure on the subject property. 
b.  Issue building, construction, zoning and demolition permits. 
c.  Alter, restore, renovate, move or demolish any structure on the subject property or significantly change the appearance of such property, until such time as final administrative action, as provided by this chapter, is completed.

Sec. 46-67. - Application for certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Required. No building, structure, improvement, landscape feature or archaeological site within the city that is designated pursuant to section 46-66 shall be erected, altered, restored, renovated, excavated, moved or demolished until an application for a certificate of appropriateness regarding any architectural features, landscape features or site improvements has been submitted to and approved pursuant to the procedures in this section. Architectural features shall included but not be limited to the architectural style, scale, massing, siting, general design and general arrangement of the exterior of the building or structure, including the type, style and color of roofs, windows, doors, and appurtenances.

Landscape features and site improvements shall include but are not limited to site regarding, subsurface alterations, fill deposition, paving, landscaping walls, fences, courtyards, signs and exterior lighting. No certificate of appropriateness shall be approved unless the architectural plans for the construction, alteration, excavation, restoration, renovation, relocation or demolition is approved by the historic preservation board. 
(b)  Procedure. The historic preservation board shall develop procedures for making application for a certificate of appropriateness. 
(c)  Standards. The board shall adopt and may from time to time amend the standards by which applications for any certificate of appropriateness are to be measured and evaluated. In the absence of such standards, the city establishes the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation as standards governing preservation. The foregoing federal standards shall be the minimum standards of the city, although the city may establish additional standards. In adopting these guidelines, it is the intent of the board to promote maintenance, restoration, adaptive reuses appropriate to the property, and compatible contemporary designs that are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features of neighboring buildings, sites and streetscapes. 
(d)  Certificate of appropriateness. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued in accordance with the following: 
(1)  An applicant for a certificate of appropriateness shall submit the application to the board pursuant to section 46-66 and shall accompany such application to the board with full plans and specifications, site plan, and samples of materials as deemed appropriate by the board to fully describe the proposed appearance, color, texture or materials, and architectural design of the building and any outbuilding, wall, courtyard, fence, landscape feature, paving, signage and exterior lighting. The applicant shall provide adequate information to enable the board to visualize the effect of the proposed action on the applicant's building and its adjacent buildings and streetscapes. If such application involves a designated archaeological site, the applicant shall provide full plans and specifications of work that may affect the surface and subsurface of the archaeological site. 
(2)  The board may hold a public hearing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness affecting property under its control. In such instance, notice and procedure of the public hearing shall be given to the property owner by certified mail and to other interested parties by an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation of at least ten days prior to the hearing. 
(3)  The board shall act upon an application within 60 days of receipt of application materials adequately describing the proposed action. The board shall approve, deny, approve in modified form (subject to the acceptance of the modification by the applicant), or suspend action on the application for a period not to exceed 30 days in order to seek technical advice from outside its members or to meet further with the applicant to revise or modify the application. 
(4)  The decision of the board shall be issued in writing. Evidence of approval of the application shall be by certificate of appropriateness issued by the board, and whatever its decision notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the director of both the building and planning divisions. When an application is denied, the board's notice shall provide an adequate written explanation of its decision to disapprove the application. The board shall keep a record of its actions under this chapter. 
(e)  Demolition. Demolition shall be in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement or site may occur pursuant to an order of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to an application by the owner for a certificate of appropriateness. 
(2)  Government agencies having the authority to demolish unsafe structures shall receive notice of designation of individual sites, districts or archaeological zones pursuant to section 46-66. The board shall be deemed an interested party and shall be entitled to receive notice of any public hearings conducted by such government agency regarding demolition of any designated property. The board may make recommendations and suggestions to the government agency and the owner relative to the feasibility of and the public interest in preserving the designated property. 
(3)  No permit for voluntary demolition of a designated building, structure, improvement or site shall be issued to the owner thereof until an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted and approved pursuant to the procedures in this section. Refusal by the board to grant a certificate of appropriateness shall be evidenced by written order detailing the public interest that is sought to be preserved. The board shall be guided by the criteria contained in subsection (e)(4) of this section. The board may grant a certificate of appropriateness that may provide for a delayed effective date of up to six months. The effective date shall be determined by the board based upon the relative significance of the structure and the probable time required to arrange a possible alternative to demolition. During the demolition delay period, the board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve the structure concerned, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. Such steps may include but shall not be limited to consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens; recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or agencies; and exploration of the possibility of moving one or more structures or other features. 
(4)  In addition to all other sections of this chapter, the board shall consider the following criteria in evaluating applications for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition of designated properties: 
a.  Is the structure of such interest or quality that it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as an historic or architectural landmark? 
b.  Is the structure of such design, craftsmanship, or material that it could be reproduced only with great difficulty and/or expense? 
c.  Is the structure one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the city, or the region? 
d.  Does the structure contribute significantly to the historic character of a designated district? 
e.  Would retention of the structure promote the general welfare of the city by providing an opportunity for study of local history, architecture, and design or by developing an understanding of the importance and value of a particular culture and heritage? 
f.  Are there definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what will be the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area? 
(5)  Demolition by neglect . An owner of a designated property shall comply with all applicable laws, codes and regulations governing property maintenance. Property owners should preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect exterior features and interior portions of such properties when maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay. A property owner shall promptly correct the following defects: 
a.  Facades that are in disrepair and susceptible to collapse. 
b.  Deteriorated or inadequate foundation, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls or other vertical structural supports.

e.  Any fault or defect that renders the structure or building structurally unsafe, insufficiently protected from weathering or not properly watertight. 
A property owner may apply for a variance if the property owner believes that to repair or maintain such property according to this chapter creates an undue economic hardship. 
(f)  Variances. Where, because of particular site conditions and restraints or because of unusual circumstances applicable solely to the particular applicant, strict enforcement of this chapter would result in serious undue economic hardship to the applicant, the board shall have the power to vary or modify adherence to this chapter, provided, always, that the board's decisions ensure harmony with the general purposes of this chapter and will not adversely affect the city. Guidelines for the application of this subsection may be developed by the board 
(g)  Issuance of building permits. No building permit shall be issued by the building official that affects any designated property in the city without a certificate of appropriateness. 
(h)  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to the issuance of any certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of the certificate. The mayor shall designate an appropriate official to assist the board by making necessary inspections in connection with enforcement of this chapter. Such official shall be empowered to issue a stop work order if performance is not in accordance with the issued certificate. No work shall proceed as long as a stop work order continues in effect. Copies of inspection reports shall be furnished to the board and copies of any stop work orders both to the board and the applicant. The building official or other appropriate official and staff to the board shall be responsible for ensuring that any work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be corrected to comply with the certificate of appropriateness prior to withdrawing the stop work order. 
(i)  Emergency conditions. For the purpose of the remedying emergency conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or property, nothing contained in this section shall prevent the making of any temporary construction, reconstruction or other repairs to a building or site in the city, pursuant to an order of a government agency or a court of competent jurisdiction. The owner of a building damaged by fire or natural calamity shall be permitted to stabilize the building immediately without board approval and to rehabilitate it later under the normal review procedures of this chapter. 
(j)  Review of applications. The board shall have the authority to review applications for certificates of appropriateness for all property in the city, however title is held, by either private or public parties. The purposes of this chapter shall apply equally to plans, projects or work executed or assisted by any private party, governmental body or agency, department, authority or board of the city, county or state.

All applications for permits involving new construction, large scale digging, the removal of trees or any other activity that may reveal or disturb an interred archaeological or paleontological site in an archaeological or paleontological zone shall require a certificate to dig before approval. Based on the designation report for the archaeological zone, a complete application for a certificate to dig and any additional guidelines the historic preservation board may deem necessary, the board shall, within 30 days from the date the completed application has been filed, approve the application for a certificate to dig by the owners of a property in a designated archaeological zone. The certificate to dig may be made subject to specified conditions, including but not limited to conditions regarding site excavation. In order to comply with the site excavation requirements of the certificate to dig, the applicant may be required to permit the county archaeologist or paleontologist or other archeologist or paleontologist assigned by the board to conduct an excavation from the time of the approval of the certificate to dig until the effective date hereof. 
(b)  Approved certificate. Approved certificates to dig shall contain an effective date no later than 60 days after approval, at which time the proposed activity may begin, unless prior to or during that period the board decides to designate the site in question as an individual site or district pursuant to section 46-66, in which event all the rules and regulations pertaining to the designation process shall apply from the date the designation report has been filed. 
(c)  Enforcement. All work performed pursuant to the issuance of a certificate to dig shall conform to the requirements of such certificate.

Sec. 54-31. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm system means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical, arranged to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other activity requiring urgent attention and to which the police department or fire department is expected to respond, excluding automobile alarm systems; medical alert systems; alarm systems connected to any municipal, county, state or federally controlled building or structure. 
    Alarm user means the person in control of any building, structure or facility or portion thereof wherein an alarm system is maintained. 
    Appeals board means the code enforcement board or special master or hearing officer, who shall act as an impartial arbitrator at hearings related to the enforcement of this article. 
    Automatic telephone dialing alarm system means the automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and includes any system which, upon being activated, automatically transmits by telephone or telephone line to the police department or fire department a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for emergency response; or a system which, upon activation, connects to an answering service whose function it is to transmit to the police department or fire department a need for emergency response. 
    False alarm means a signal from an alarm system that elicits a response by the police when no emergency, actual or threatened, criminal activity requiring immediate response exists; or that elicits a response by the fire department when no emergency exists. This definition includes signals activated by negligence, accident, mechanical failure, and electrical failure; signals activated intentionally in nonemergency situations; and signals for which the actual cause of activation is unknown. It is a rebuttable presumption that an alarm is false if personnel responding from the police department or fire department do not discover any evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity, or other emergency after following normal police or fire department operating procedures respectively in investigating the incident. An alarm is not false if the alarm user proves that: 
(1)  An individual activated the alarm based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency, actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate response, existed; or 
(2)  The alarm system was activated by lighting or an electrical surge that caused physical damage to the system, as evidenced by the testimony of a licensed alarm system contractor who conducted an on-site inspection and personally observed the damage.

(d)  If the retiree should predecease spouse or should die leaving other eligible dependents surviving the retiree and if the spouse and/or other eligible dependents were covered by the city's group health insurance at the time of the retiree's death, the spouse and/or other eligible dependents may elect to continue coverage for as long as they would have been eligible had the retiree survived, merely by payment of the full premium for such spouse and/or other eligible dependents to the city.

Sec. 70-243. - Optional form of retirement income in lieu of normal service retirement allowance. 
(a)  Options described. The election of the options in this section by a member shall apply only to pension income, as defined in section 70-96, and shall not affect payments from the annuity, as defined in section 70-96. In lieu of the amount and form of pension income payable for normal retirement as outlined in section 70-238, as amended, a participant, while in the active service of the city as a member of the retirement plan, upon written request to the board of trustees and subject to their approval, may elect to receive such pension income of equivalent actuarial value payable as described herein. The election of any one of the following options is irrevocable after the participant retires: 
(1)  Joint and 66 2/3-percent survivorship. A pension income of an actuarially reduced amount of the normal benefit, payable to the retirant during the joint lifetime of the retirant and a joint pensioner designated by the retirant; and following the death of either of them, two-thirds of such reduced pension shall be payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. 
(2)  Joint and 50-percent survivorship. A pension income of an actuarially reduced amount of the normal benefit, payable to the retirant during the joint lifetime of the retirant and a joint pensioner designated by the retirant; and following the death of either of them, one-half of such reduced pension shall be payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor. 
(3)  Joint and 100-percent survivorship. A pension income of an actuarially reduced amount of the normal benefit, payable to the retirant during the joint lifetime of the retirant and a joint pensioner designated by the retirant; this shall be a one-time reduction and will not be altered in the future as a result of the death of the retirant or the joint pensioner. 
(4)  Joint and pop-up survivorship. A pension income of an actuarially reduced amount of the normal benefit, payable to the retirant during the joint lifetime of the retirant and a joint pensioner designated by the retirant; if the retirant dies first, the beneficiary's pension remains the same; if the beneficiary precedes the retirant, the retirant's pension reverts the applicable normal service retirement under subsections 70-238(c)(1), (2) and (3). 
The member electing one of the options described in this subsection will designate the joint pensioner who is to receive the benefit, if any, payable under this section after the member's death and will have the power up until the time of retirement to change such designation from time to time, but any such change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to all the limitations of this section. Each such designation will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees. 
If a member dies while in the service of the city prior to retirement and the member has not reached retirement requirements and elected survivor benefits, no benefit will be payable under this option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined as provided in section 70-250. 
If the member dies on or off the job, while still employed with the city, and had reached retirement requirements and elected survivor benefits, the member's joint pensioner would then begin receiving retirement benefits as provided for under the joint and survivor benefit selected, based on age and years of service of the employee at time of death and the age of the joint pensioner. 
If the joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under this system, the option elected will be canceled automatically, and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon retirement, unless a new election is made prior to retirement. 
The joint pensioner of a retired member who elected the optional form of retirement income provided in this section shall not be entitled to death benefits as provided in section 70-250. 
(b)  Limitations. In order to receive the benefits described in this section, the member must have reached retirement requirements and elected one of the options in subsection (a) of this section, and the designated joint pensioner must be the beneficiary designated by the member prior to or at the time of retirement.

(b)  Disability benefits not connected with the line of duty for members shall have a service pension under section 70-238 but limited to and only to a maximum of 66 2/3 percent of the average compensation of three years of membership service that represents three individual years of the highest annual salary to which an annuity contribution has been paid to the retirement system, with group health insurance benefits as provided in section 70-249(c).

The board of trustees is not required to consent to the change of joint pensioner, but if consent is provided, the board of trustees must consider the financial impact to the retirement system of the change of joint pensioner prior to consent. 
If the joint pensioner or designated beneficiary dies before the firefighter member or police officer member's retirement, the option elected will be automatically cancelled and a retirement pension income of the normal form and amount under section 70-238 or 70-252, whichever is greater, will be payable to the firefighter member or police officer member upon retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made according to the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the firefighter member or police officer member prior to retirement and within 90 days after the death of the beneficiary.

When this money is received, it shall be prorated to each qualifying police officer as stated, in proportion to the number of individual shares for the year in which the tax was levied, by credit to the officer's individual account or by payment directly to the police officer if the officer has separated from city employment and withdrawn his annuity savings fund contributions subsequent to the January 1 stated in this subsection. 
(d)  Any police officer employed by the city for nine months of continuous employment after the adoption of this section (June 22, 1965) who does not desire to accept the provisions of this section after being notified in writing of its stipulations 30 days prior to completion of his nine months of continuous employment by the secretary of the retirement system and notifies the officer, or board paying the salary of such police officer, in writing, to the effect, shall be barred from participating in the additional benefits derived from this amendment (Ord. No. 1410) to section 24-53 of the Code of 1960 subsequent to the effective date of this amendment (Ord. No. 1410).

No police officer shall have any vested right in any state police retirement funds received by the city which have been credited to the officer's annuity savings fund, until after ten years of accumulated retirement system membership, except in case of retirement for total and permanent disability. The provision applies to all police officers who become employed subsequent to the effective date of Ordinance No. 1410 (October 24, 1961). 
Shares. Each participant shall be entitled to one share in the fund for each full year of service as a participant of the police retirement fund rendered before and/or after the effective date of this section (November 22, 1966). Promptly after passage of this section (November 22, 1966) the number of full years of service rendered by each participant as a member of the police retirement fund prior to the passage of this section shall be determined, and a record thereof shall be made on the participant's service record and the participant shall thereupon have as many shares as full years of service rendered, and thereafter each full fiscal year of service as defined as extending from January 1 to the following December 31, both dates inclusive, shall add one more share to the credit of each participant. 
Determining value of shares to participant. The number of shares to which each and every participant is entitled to at the close of each fiscal year shall be added together, and the total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the net amount of money available to be allocated and credited to the respective share accounts. The amount to be credited to the account of each participant will then be obtained by multiplying the value determined for one share by the total number of shares to which each participant is entitled. No participant can accumulate more than 20 shares.

To the extent applicable to this plan, if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation for the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (adjusted under this section for years of participation less than 10, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified or utilized in the plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified or utilized in the plan; or (2) a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined or utilized in the plan. 
The plan does not have immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement. To the extent applicable to this applicable to this plan, if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent to the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (adjusted under this section for years of participation less than 10, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date as defined or utilized in the plan (and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
The plan has immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of commencement benefit commencement. To the extent applicable to this plan, if the annuity starting date for the member's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation at the member's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under this section and the Defined Benefit Dollar Limitation (adjusted under this section for years of participation less than 10 if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the member's starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this plan at the member's annuity starting date is the actual amount of such annuity payable to the member, computed disregarding the member's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the member. 
(g)  The limitation year is the calendar year. 
(h)  A member's normal retirement benefit is non-forfeitable upon attainment of normal retirement age, as provide in section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(i)  Rollover of distributions. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover, as provided in section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an "inherited" individual retirement account as described in section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a non-spouse beneficiary receives a distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non-direct) rollover.

Sec. 74-150. - Billboard replacement program. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose and intent of the billboard replacement program is to allow traditional and/or digital billboards within city boundaries facing the Palmetto Expressway, State Road 112 and facing that portion of I-75 that extends in an east-west direction, to substitute unsightly and unsafe roof-top or traditional billboards that possess legal nonconforming status, notwithstanding the prohibition of such signs as found elsewhere in this article. Such billboards facing the Palmetto Expressway, State Road 112 and facing that portion of I-75 that extends in an east-west direction. The billboard to be replaced in an existing location or a new replacement location may include LED sign face or faces subject to the compliance with the provisions of this section and the reduction of sign faces on the existing or replaced sign through a ratio of two sign faces for each LED sign face for traditional billboards. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings described to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Automatic changing or digital billboard sign means a billboard that utilizes a mechanism to allow advertisements to rotate in succession. 
    Billboard means an off-site large outdoor structure that is predominately a sign in which the message or advertisement comprises an activity or business that is not operating or being conducted on the property in which the billboard is located. The words "billboard" and "sign" as used in this section are interchangeable since the regulations concern only billboards. 
    Embellishments mean a physical or structural extension to the billboard that enhances, emphasizes or directs attention to the sign message. 
    Grade means crown or highest elevation of the adjacent road. 
    Mobile billboard means a billboard that includes a sign, installed on or attached to a vehicle, or connected to a vehicle as a trailer, that is capable of transport. Mobile billboards cannot be parked in an open parking lot, parking space or open space, but must be garaged and not visible to the public, when the vehicle is not in transit. 
    Sign face means the sign surface where the advertisement is exhibited. 
    Roof-top sign means a billboard erected on top of a roof of a building. 
    Traditional billboard means a large outdoor structure, excluding a roof-top sign, which is predominately a sign where the advertisement does not rotate, but is stationary. 
(c)  Regulations supplemental to state law. The provisions of this section are supplemental to state law and shall be construed to complement and be reconciled with state law, where possible. To the extent that there is an irreconcilable conflict with applicable state sign law, rule or regulation, state law shall prevail. In any event, signs facing state roads shall comply with state sign law, rule and regulations in addition to compliance with the provisions set forth in this section and in relocation and reconstruction agreements pursuant to F.S. § 70.20. 
(d)  Location. The replacement sign permit as described in this section shall apply only to the relocation or replacement, repair or retrofit of existing permitted billboards facing the Palmetto Expressway, State Road 112 and facing that portion of I-75 that extends in an east-west direction that have a legal nonconforming status as of the effective date of this ordinance; provided, however, in no event shall the replacement or relocation of a billboard result in an increase in the number of billboards within the city. The replacement of roof-top billboards is encouraged through relocation and the replacement of interior signs or signs facing residential neighborhoods are preferred. A replacement, repaired, retrofitted or relocated sign may include one or more LED sign faces contingent upon the reduction of sign faces on the existing or replaced sign in a ratio of two sign faces for each LED sign face for traditional billboards. A new monopole billboard that replaces a removed roof-top sign may include one LED sign face without a reduction of sign faces that existed on the existing or replaced sign. Any additional LED sign faces on the replaced roof-top sign will require the reduction of sign faces in a ratio of two sign faces for one LED sign face. 
(e)  Sign type. The billboard shall only be a detached, non-mobile digital sign. 
(f)  Maximum number. No more than two sign faces shall be placed in a monopole structure. 
(g)  Maximum size and area. Billboard signs shall be limited to 672 square feet per face, not including embellishments. 
(h)  Minimum setback, spacing and distance separation. The minimum setback to the monopole structure shall be 15 feet from the surface edge of the right-of-way; five feet from the interior side of the property line; and 30 feet from any lot on which there is a residential building, except as otherwise provided in a relocation and reconstruction agreement.

(i)  Design standards. Replacement signs shall involve a significant enhancement of the original sign conditions including but not limited to the structure, faces, site, parking, landscaping and perimeter fencing. 
(1)  Shape and height. The shape of the billboard signs shall be back-to back or "V" shape on a monopole base, with their faces oriented in opposite directions located not more than 15 feet apart at the nearest point between two faces, where feasible. The size, shape and height of billboard signs and distance separation requirements shall be according to the state department of transportation permitting requirements. The height of the sign shall not exceed 65 feet, as measured from the crown of the road to the top of the sign face. The ladder shall be no closer than 15 feet above the ground. 
(2)  Structure color. The structural components, support poles and any part of the sign that is not part of the display face is to be painted matte silver with the exception of certain secondary components that could be painted in black to be obscured from view. 
(3)  Display colors. The color, or combination of colors in the advertisement display shall in no way correspond to the colors or combination of colors specified for road traffic signals or traffic signs. The advertisement display shall in no way be similar enough to be mistaken to represent a road traffic sign. Audio speakers or any form of pyrotechnics are prohibited in association with an automatic changing sign. 
(4)  Illumination. 
a.  No illumination shall be installed on a billboard that may conflict with abutting or adjacent uses, residential uses or areas, in a manner that such uses are materially restricted or impacted so as to deny the basic enjoyment or implementation of use. 
b.  All digital billboard displays shall utilize ambient light sensors to automatically adjust its intensity of illumination based on the ambient light conditions occurring at the time of adjustment. Digital billboards shall not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.3-foot candles above ambient light, as measured using a foot candle meter at a pre-set distance. Pre-set distances to measure the foot candles impact vary with the expected viewing distances of each size sign. Measurement distance criteria shall be as follows: 
Face size Distance to be measured from 12 feet × 25 feet 150 feet 14 feet × 48 feet 250 feet  
(5)  Duration. Any portion of the message to be displayed must have a minimum duration of eight seconds and must be a static display. No portion of the message may flash, scroll, twirl, change color, fade in or out or in any manner imitate movement. The time to completely change from one message to the next is a maximum of two seconds. The change of message shall occur simultaneously for the entire sign. Any off-premises automatic changing sign must contain a default design that will in the event of a malfunction either hold the face of the display on the sign in any one position, turn the face of the display on the sign off or show "full black" on the face of the display on the sign. 
(6)  Landscaping and perimeter fencing. Where feasible, metal picket or black vinyl coated chain-link fencing are required. Landscaping that is approved through the replacement sign approval process shall be viable and maintained at all times except as further provided in a relocation and reconstruction agreement where mitigation may be considered for the conversion of an existing sign 
(i)  Replacement sign permit fee, permit application, review and neighborhood enhancement and park contribution. The owner or operator of a proposed replacement billboard, with the written consent of the property owner of the property where the sign is to be located, may apply for a replacement sign permit, in an application provided by the city, including all electrical, structural, elevation and color depictions, measurements and other drawings or plans required by the city, for review and approval by the city planning and building divisions. The plans shall include an updated survey and a site plan including landscaping and parking space for vehicles for maintenance purposes and show the location and the setback of all buildings and structures on the property and within a 100-foot radius of the proposed sign location. The application shall provide a signed copy of the lease or easement agreement with the property owner and sign owner or operator or a memorandum of such agreement, if applicable. Within 15 days after the sign owner or operator receives all final governmental approvals, authorizations and permits for the billboard replacement sign, the sign owner or operator shall completely remove the sign and supporting structures to be replaced, prior to the completion of construction of the new sign. Complete removal includes, but is not limited to, the faces, structure, electrical connections and all other appurtenances related to the sign to be replaced. Work pursuant to a replacement sign permit shall require that the site be prepared, cleared or repaired. The replacement sign permit fee shall be $25,000.00, which shall be paid at the time the application is accepted by the city or as otherwise provided in the relocation and reconstruction agreement. An annual neighborhood enhancement and park contribution of $15,000.00 for each year that the replacement sign is located on the property is an example of adequate consideration for the reconstruction and relocation agreement. 
(j)  Denial of permit. The city reserves the right to reject a replacement sign permit for failure to comply with the requirements of this section. If the city denies a permit, the city shall provide written reasons for its denial. 
(k)  Relocation and reconstruction agreements. The sign owner and operator shall sign a relocation and reconstruction agreement pursuant to F.S. § 70.20, prior to the issuance of the replacement sign permit in form and substance acceptable to the city and the sign owner and operator. 
(l)  Credit for annual recertification fee payment. For the first ten years from the year in which the new replacement sign is approved, the sign owner is excused from payment of the annual recertification fee for the legally nonconforming replacement billboards.

Similarly, a property owner, occupant and tenant, jointly and severally, shall have the duty to maintain the front, side and rear yard of the owned, leased or occupied property in a clean and presentable condition.

(Ord. No. 2001-95, § 1, 11-27-2001) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2001-95, § 1, adopted November 27, 2001, repealed the § 78-34, and enacted a new § 78-34 as set out herein. The former § 78-34 pertained to similar work done by the city to keep property in sanitary condition and derived from Code 1960, § 13-2(e)-(g); Ord. No. 84-56, § 2(Art. I, § 2), 5-22-84.

The city shall demand the property owner, tenant or occupant pay for all costs and expenses incurred in cleaning, clearing, correcting or abating the nuisance and restoring the property to a safe and sanitary condition, including costs for labor and materials. If not paid within 30 days, the city shall levy a special assessment lien in the total amount of costs and expenses incurred against the property. This lien shall be deemed a special assessment lien, since costs and expenses incurred by the city confer a specific benefit upon the property burdened by the assessment. The special assessment lien shall be a first lien equal in dignity to liens for nonpayment of taxes and be superior in dignity to and have priority over all other mortgages, judgments, liens and encumbrances on any property against which such special assessment lien has been filed. The lien amount shall bear interest at a rate of eight percent annually and shall continue in full force and effect until paid.

    No garbage or trash shall be burned, buried, placed around shrubbery or trees, or used as fowl or fish food or transported upon the public streets, roads, alleys, driveways or rights-of-way of the city. The burning, burying, placing around shrubbery or trees; using as animal, fowl or fish food; or transporting on the public streets, roads, alleys, driveways or rights-of-way of the city of garbage or otherwise illegal discarding of garbage or trash shall constitute prima facie evidence of violation of this chapter by the householder or manager of the premises on which the garbage or trash shall have occurred or from which the garbage or trash shall have been transported. The presence of ashes, charred wastes and like substances on the premises shall constitute prima facie evidence of burning. No waste shall be permitted to accumulate so as to comprise a nuisance, fire hazard, breeding place for flies or other insects, or harbor for rodents.

Sec. 78-38. - Registration of properties with mortgages in default by mortgagees 
(a)  Any mortgagee who holds a mortgage on any real property located within the city, regardless of the property's land use designation, zoning district, or nature of the use or uses given to the structures found on the property, and who has determined that such mortgage is in default, has issued a notice of default, has recorded a lis pendens, or taken any other legal action to enforce its right to accelerate the debt or foreclose its interest in the property, shall register the property with the city's code compliance division or designee. The mortgagee must register the property within 15 days from the date it first gives notice to the debtor/mortgagor of its intent to accelerate the debt and/or foreclose its interest in the property. Together with the registration, the mortgagee must submit an annual fee of $200.00 for each property registered. The mortgagee must designate an individual or entity to act as its local agent who shall be responsible for inspecting, maintaining and securing the property according to the provisions of this section and be available to be contacted by the city during regular business hours. The local agent must have a place of business in Miami-Dade County. Registration pursuant to this section shall contain the name, direct mailing address, a direct contact name, telephone number, and e-mail address for the mortgagee/trustee, and the servicer, and the name and 24- hour contact phone number of the local property management company responsible for the security and maintenance of the property who has the authority to make decisions concerning the abatement of nuisance conditions at the property, as well as any expenditure in connection therewith. Any change in the information required must be reported to the code compliance division within ten days from the date of the change. If the mortgagee who first registers the property assigns the mortgage in default to another, the mortgagee must notify the city of the assignment, the identify and contact information of the assignee. The assignee must re-register the property, pay the registration fee, designate a local agent and provide all the information required for registration. 
(b)  The mortgagee, through its designated local agent, must perform an inspection within 15 days from the date the mortgagee first gives notice to the debtor/mortgagor of its intent to accelerate the debt and/or foreclose its interest in the property to determine whether it is vacant or abandoned. Vacancy shall be determined when the property is no longer occupied by persons with the lawful right to occupy the property or persons named as party-defendants in a foreclosure action affecting the property. Abandonment shall be determined when one or more conditions on the property, such as failure to keep any one of the maintenance and security standards described herein, leads a reasonable person to believe the property is abandoned. The local agent must continue to inspect the property for this purpose every 30 days from the date of the agent's first inspection. If at any time the property becomes vacant or abandoned, the mortgagee, through its designated local agent, shall be responsible to perform the work necessary to bring the property into compliance with and maintain and secure the property according to the standards established in this section. 
(c)  The mortgagee's obligation to register, inspect, maintain and secure properties with mortgages in default shall continue for as long as the mortgage remains in default, whether the mortgage in default has been foreclosed or not, until such time when the default is cured, the property is sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale, the property is sold or transferred to a third party with the consent of the mortgagee who registers the property. The mortgagee, through its designated local agent, must notify the code compliance division of such sale, transfer, or occupancy. There will be no refund of a fee paid to the city. The mortgagee shall be under a continuing obligation to register, inspect, maintain and secure the property if the mortgagee assumes title to the property securing the mortgage in default. 
(d)  Maintenance and security standards. Properties registered pursuant to this section must be kept in accordance with the standards set forth in sections 78-31, 78-32 and 78-34 of the Code. In addition, properties shall be maintained free from weeds, overgrown grass or brush, dead vegetation, garbage, trash, junk, debris, any accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers, discarded personal items such as furniture, clothing, appliances, or any other items leading a reasonable person to believe the property is not being properly maintained or is abandoned. Weeds, grass, brush, or dead vegetation shall not be over six inches in height. The property shall be maintained free of graffiti or similar markings by removal or painting over with an exterior grade paint that matches the color of the exterior structure. Pools, spas, fountains, ponds, or outdoor aquariums shall be kept in working order so as to prevent the creation of an environment for the breeding of mosquitoes or other unsanitary environment through the accumulation of stagnant or polluted water, pollutants and/or debris. Water clarity shall be such that the bottom of the pool or spa can be seen from the pool or spa deck. If the pool or spa is emptied, then it must be securely covered. Doors, windows, gates, fences and all other openings of such size to allow a child or adult to access the interior of any structure on the property shall be kept locked and secured to prevent any trespassers, squatters or other unauthorized persons. 
(e)  Failure to register, inspect, maintain, or secure the property in accordance with the standards established in this section or failure to notify the city of any changes in material information required by this section is a violation of the Code and may be subject to enforcement by any means available to the city, including, but not limited to, a lot clearing lien, if applicable, and civil penalties provided in chapter 22 herein.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, adopted February 22, 2011, amended articles III, IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former articles III, IV §§ 78-61, 78-62, 78-91-78-97 pertained to garbage collection and trash collection. See Code Comparative Table for history. 

A. - Recyclable Materials 

Sec. 78-61. - Intent. 
    Since residential waste makes up between 55 to 65 percent of municipal solid waste, it is the intent of the city to establish a mandatory residential citywide recycling program to contribute towards preserving our environment, conserving natural resources, decreasing pollution, saving energy and downsizing landfills. To this end, this article is enacted to encourage recycling activities throughout the city to the fullest extent possible. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 78-62. - Collection of recyclable material, schedule. 
    It is the function exclusively of the department of solid waste to collect all recyclable material in the city except as authorized by the city. Recyclable material will be collected once every two weeks on a schedule determined by the director of solid waste. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 78-63. - Containers and location. 
(a)  All recyclable material to be collected by the city shall be contained in containers provided for by the city only. The city shall provide all household solid waste account holders containers approved for the collection and disposal of recyclable material. The cost of replacing lost or damaged containers, where the damage is as a result of neglect, abuse, mutilation or modification, shall be paid by the account holder. The city will replace, free of charge, containers that are damaged as a result of the collection process or stolen containers, so long as the account holder submits a copy of the police report for the theft. It shall be unlawful for any person to place or cause or allow to be placed any recyclable material for collection in any other container, receptacle or bag or in any other manner except as provided for in this article. 
(b)  Each household account holder is obligated to separate recyclable materials and place them inside the designated container provided for collection. Failure to recycle is a violation of this section. Failure to set out recyclable material in the designated container for collection for two consecutive collection days together with the presence of any recyclable material commingled with, in the container designated for garbage collection, or otherwise disposed of or set out for collection as garbage shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that a violation has occurred for failure to recycle. 
(c)  Containers for recyclable materials shall be placed for collection in front of the property, on the swale area, between the sidewalk and the street pavement, or immediately adjacent to the sidewalk, where curb and gutter exist being mindful not to obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Where automated collection is provided, the container shall be placed on the curb cut or driveway approach no more than three feet from the edge of the street or roadway and no less than five feet from any other container or object. The front of the cart shall face the street. Containers shall not be placed on the sidewalk or street or in any location where automated collection may be obstructed, difficult or impeded. 
(d)  Containers shall be placed for collection no earlier than one day prior to the scheduled collection day and no later than 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the collection day. Containers shall be removed on the day of collection.

(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 2-22-2011) 
Sec. 78-75. - Removal of waste by private agencies. 
(a)  The director of the department of solid waste may authorize the collection of solid waste by private collectors if it is a commercial account or if the residential account contains four or more residential units contiguous to each other and under the same ownership or contains four or more residential condominium units; provided, however, that the residential account is not located in the Hialeah Downtown Urban Center (HDUC) district or properties located within the CBD, CR and R-3-D districts. New residential and commercial accounts in the HDUC, CBD, CR and R-3-D zoning districts shall be serviced by the city. Elsewhere, if private collection is authorized, the contract with the private collector must include garbage, trash, bulk trash, bulk yard trash, and recyclable materials collection. In addition, the contract must provide collection of recyclable materials at least once every other week, unless otherwise indicated, garbage collection service at least two times during each week, and bulk trash collection once a month. If the minimum frequency of garbage collection service is insufficient to prevent a waste overflow, then the private collector must increase the number of onsite collections to prevent unsanitary conditions. Waste overflow will be determined by the city to include not only circumstances where garbage and trash have spilled over or out of the container but where the container cover cannot be closed or sealed tightly, leaving garbage and trash visible and exposed. If private collection is authorized, the sanitation collector must utilize dumpsters for the collection of garbage and trash. All dumpsters will contain the name of the servicing company and its phone number. Dumpsters will not be located in any of the city's rights-of-way, and must be contained on the private property being served. All dumpsters will be screened from the direct view of the adjacent property owner, and the property owner utilizing a private collection service will be responsible for keeping the area around the container in a clean and presentable condition as well as keeping the sidewalk and swale area free of all trash and litter. In order to ensure sanitary conditions and not create any health hazards to the community, all dumpsters shall be watertight and maintained in proper state of repair. No waste shall be permitted to accumulate so as to comprise a nuisance, fire hazard, breeding place for flies or other insects, or harbor for rodents. The city has the right to remove all abandoned dumpsters after proper notice to the company shown on the dumpsters. Dumpsters shall not be placed on public property, including public rights-of-way and swale areas. The city shall consider dumpsters, located on public property, as abandoned and shall remove the dumpster, after posting a 24-hour notice on the dumpster for its removal, at the cost to the property owner or the private collector, if applicable. 
(b)  Effective July 1, 2008, all private waste haulers operating within city limits shall be required to pay a franchise fee of $1,500.00 for each year plus 8 percent of the nonexclusive franchisee's quarterly gross receipts collected from accounts serviced within the city. The percentage of gross receipts fee component shall increase to 25 percent of quarterly gross receipts collected effective October 1, 2016 and continue at 25 percent of quarterly gross receipts collected each year thereafter. The franchisee shall, on or before 30 days following the end of each quarter, deliver to the city a true and correct statement of gross receipts collected during the previous quarter along with payment. Notwithstanding the accounting year used by the franchisee, the quarters end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year. This franchise fee is not applicable to open top roll offs, which fees are set forth in article VII herein. A late fee of one and one-half percent for the first month shall be imposed if payment is not received by the tenth day of the next month that follows the month that the quarterly payment is due. For each month of nonpayment thereafter, the one and one-half percent late fee shall be imposed. 
(1)  The franchisee shall allow city auditors, after reasonable written notice and during regular business hours, to audit, inspect, and examine the franchisee's financial books and records and tax returns, insofar as such records relate to accounts within city limits, for the purpose of verifying the franchisee's compliance with this section. 
(2)  The franchisee shall receive an administrative cost credit of two and one-half percent of the percentage of gross receipts collected that shall be deducted from the percentage of gross receipts collected and remitted in each quarterly statement submitted to the city. This credit shall only be allowed if the franchisee makes payment in a timely manner without incurring a late fee and complies with city reporting requirements. If a city auditor finds that a franchisee has underreported its collected gross receipts on a quarterly statement, the city may suspend or revoke the franchise according to the license suspension and revocation procedures depending on the extent of underreporting and the intention of the franchisee. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any person to collect, remove or transport any solid waste material for compensation for any location or premises within the city without first having been authorized to do so by the department of solid waste. The requirements for a certificate of authorization from the department of solid waste are as follows: 
(1)  A city business tax receipt (occupational license) upon payment of city business tax (formerly known as occupational license fee). 
(2)  Submittal of a properly completed application for dumpster certificates. 
(3)  A payment and performance bond in the amount of 30 percent of the average quarterly collected gross receipts of accounts serviced within city limits for the previous year, with the city as the obligee. 
(4)  Proof of comprehensive general public liability insurance of a minimum of $500,000.00. 
(5)  Payment of the annual franchise fee and required percentage of quarterly gross receipts collected. 
(6)  The council may waive the requirement of the payment and performance bond upon request based on exigent or special circumstances. 
(d)  Private waste collection companies shall provide service to accounts located within 300 feet of any residence only between the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. 
(e)  If a private collector intends to discontinue service to an account, the private collector must notify the city of its intent to discontinue or terminate service within 14 days of cessation of service. If the private collector does not notify the city of its intent to discontinue service, then the city will confiscate the dumpster and impose a collection, cleaning and storage charge to the private collector. The city will immediately service the account if private collection service ceases or is discontinued and charge the property for service provided. 
(f)  In addition to the penalties provided in this Code, violation of the provisions of this section shall be cause for suspension or revocation of the city occupational license.

(3)  Molest, remove, handle, salvage or otherwise disturb the containers or other materials that have been placed on city property for servicing by the trash collectors. However, this subsection does not apply to the owner, occupant, lessee or tenant of the residence, dwelling or business establishment from which the container and contents or material are removed. 
(4)  Dump or cause to be dumped or placed any refuse or trash of any kind whatsoever along the right-of-way of the public highways and roads or canals of the city, county or state. No person shall cast, place, sweep or deposit anywhere within the city any refuse or trash of any kind whatsoever in any such manner that it may be carried or deposited by the elements, upon any street, road, alley, driveway, right-of-way, sewer, parkway, or other public place or into any premises within the city. 
(5)  Place or cause to be placed in any garbage or recycling container or on city property for servicing by trash collectors any acid, highly corrosive, or explosive material, inflammable liquids, hazardous, infectious or any other material of any kind deemed dangerous by the director of solid waste.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 82-1. - Legislative intent. 
    It is the intent of the city to set forth regulations and standards for construction, maintenance and use of swale areas, sidewalks, streets and other public rights-of-way; and to delineate the responsibility between the city and property owners, tenants or agents in connection therewith. 
(Ord. No. 2000-113, § 1, 11-14-2000) 
Sec. 82-2. - Private right of action. 
    Any person, including the city, that is injured, aggrieved or against whom a civil action for damage, injunction or other relief is brought, to recover for injuries or damages arising out of a violation of this chapter, or to correct a condition in violation of this chapter, may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the adjacent or abutting property owner, occupant or agent of such property, or third party, who contributed to the violation of this chapter, for damages according to the percentage that the property owner, occupant, agent or third party's violation, negligence or wrongful acts or omissions contributed to any alleged injuries or damages. The city may assert as a defense to any action that a violation of this chapter caused or allowed to be caused by an adjacent or abutting property owner, occupant or agent of such property, or third party reduces the city's liability in whole or in part by such property owner, occupant or agent of such property, or third party's violation, negligence or wrongful acts or omissions.

ARTICLE II. - SWALE AREAS 

Sec. 82-3. - Construction and maintenance of swale areas. 
(a)  Definition. As used in this section, the term "swale" is defined as the area within the public right-of-way exclusive of the paved public sidewalk and the paved roadway, curb and gutter, if any. 
(b)  Purpose. Swale areas should retain surface water and provide natural drainage through percolation of water through the ground or soil. The planting of unauthorized trees or plants or altering the contours of swale areas that negatively impact drainage in swale areas should be discouraged because such activities create traffic and health hazards and cause damage to adjacent roadways and sidewalks. 
(c)  Persons liable. Property owners, their agents and occupants, including tenants, if the property is leased, of improved or unimproved property and legally responsible third parties shall be jointly and severally liable for compliance with the duties and obligations imposed by this article upon the property owner. 
(d)  Construction and maintenance standards. 
(1)  Swale areas in both residential areas and nonresidential areas shall be constructed and maintained according to the latest edition of the county public works manual. 
(2)  It is unlawful for any owner, occupant or agent of any adjacent or abutting property, or a third party, to allow swale areas to remain in a condition that renders them unsafe, dangerous or detrimental for the purpose for which they were intended. 
(3)  Whether there is a paved or unpaved area within the swale area, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner and/or occupant to make sure that there are no holes or hidden dangers in these areas. If the city discovers that these areas are not maintained properly and if the city notifies the property owner, agent and/or occupant of an existing unsafe condition, then the person shall have ten days or such other time as provided in the notice to correct the condition. If the property owner, agent and/or occupant fails to comply with such notice, the city, at its discretion, may then perform the necessary work and assess the cost of such work against the property. Such assessment, if not paid within 30 days, shall become a lien against the property or as provided by this Code or state law. 
(e)  Removal of obstructions. 
(1)  The city, at its option, shall provide written notice to the owner of the abutting property to remove any tree, plant, shrub or other obstruction upon any street, sidewalk, or swale area within the city. If the owner of the abutting or adjacent property fails to comply with the removal of such tree, plant, shrub or other obstruction within ten days of receipt of the written notice or such other time as the notice provides, the city, at its discretion, may then perform the necessary removal operations and assess the cost of the removal against the property. Such assessment, if not paid within 30 days, shall become a lien against the property or as provided by this Code or state law. 
(2)  If any tree, plant, shrub or other obstruction upon any street, sidewalk or swale area within the city creates an emergency situation involving danger to the health, safety and welfare of the community, the city, at its discretion, may remove, trim or cut back the tree, plant, shrub or other obstruction immediately to eliminate the emergency, with or without notice to the property owner, and assess the cost of such removal, trimming or cutting back against the property. Such assessment, if not paid within 30 days, shall become a lien against the property or as provided by this Code or state law. 
(f)  Plantings in swale area. The planting of any tree or shrub in a swale area including, but not limited to, the type of plantings, the distance between trees and distance to street pavement, shall conform to the requirements of the latest edition of the county landscape manual. 
(g)  Paving of swale areas. 
(1)  Paved swales are permitted in commercially or industrially zoned districts; provided that the property owner, prior to paving, obtains a permit from the streets department and provides a paving and drainage plan that will provide for subsurface drainage or other facilities to drain the proposed paved areas without runoff onto the land of other property owners or onto the public right-of-way. In any event, the property must comply with the county landscaping requirements for off-street parking. 
(2)  In residentially zoned districts, no more than 40 percent of the swale area may be paved. If a property owner installs french drains as part of a drainage and paving plan approved by the city, the 40 percent paving limitation will not apply. Permission for paving in excess of 40 percent of the swale area, including the driveway, must be presented and approved by the streets department. Prior to paving, the property owner must obtain a permit from the streets department and comply with all conditions precedent to the issuance of the permit as established by the streets department. The paved area shall include the surface of any private driveway that connects to the public right-of-way that is located within the swale area. Any paving shall conform to the requirements of the latest edition of the county public works manual. Prior to paving any portion of the swale area, a permit must be issued by the streets department upon approval of a paving and drainage plan. If there is new construction work that increases the square footage of a building or if there are repairs, remodeling or renovation in excess of $1,000 in total cost or value of labor and materials, on the property, the property owner must comply with the current provisions of this article. Prior to issuing a building permit for the addition, repair, remodeling or renovation, the property owner or contractor shall submit a new survey of the property that includes the dimension of the swale area or an existing survey with a sketch of the swale area or a sketch of the swale area if a survey is not required. 
(h)  Permits. Prior to the issuance of a permit by the streets department for paving or planting a tree or shrub within a swale area, the property owner shall execute a declaration of restrictive covenants, agreeing to the following: (1) maintaining the landscaping, paved and unpaved areas in good condition at all times, at the property owner's expense; and (2) reserving the right of the city for placement, maintenance and repair of utility lines or future property improvements to remove, add, maintain or require removal by the owner of any improvement within the swale area; and (3) [to] hold the city harmless for damages and costs caused by any violation, negligence or intentional act or omission attributed to the property owner, occupant or agent, or third party.

Sec. 82-128. - Requirements and procedures for small wireless facilities, micro wireless facilities, utility poles and wireless support structures. 
    A request by a registrant to collocate a small wireless facility to a utility pole in the rights-of-way shall be processed in accordance with this section. 
(1)  Within 14 days after receiving an application, the city must determine and notify the applicant by electronic mail as to whether the application is complete. If an application is deemed incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An application is deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within 14 days. 
(2)  Within 14 days after the date of filing an application for collocation of a small wireless facility to a utility pole, the city may request that the proposed location of a small wireless facility be moved to another location in the rights-of-way and placed on an alternative utility pole or support structure or may place a new utility pole. The city and the applicant may negotiate the alternative location, including any objective design standards and reasonable spacing requirements for ground-based equipment, for 30 days after the date of the request. At the conclusion of the negotiation period, if the alternative location is accepted by the applicant, the applicant must notify the city of such acceptance and the application shall be deemed granted for any new location for which there is agreement and all other locations in the application. If an agreement is not reached, the applicant must notify the city of such nonagreement and the city must grant or deny the original application within 90 days after the date the application was filed. A request for an alternative location, an acceptance of an alternative location, or a rejection of an alternative location must be in writing and provided by electronic mail. 
(3)  A complete application is deemed approved if the city fails to approve or deny the application within 60 days after receipt of the application. If the city does not use the 30-day negotiation period provided in subparagraph (2) above, the parties may mutually agree to extend the 60-day application review period. The city shall grant or deny the application at the end of the extended period. A permit issued pursuant to an approved application shall remain effective for one year unless extended by the city. 
(4)  The city must notify the applicant of approval or denial by electronic mail. The city shall approve a complete application unless it does not meet the regulations provided by this article or other applicable codes. If the application is denied, the city must specify in writing the basis for denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial was based, and send the documentation to the applicant by electronic mail on the day the city denies the application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within 30 days after notice of the denial is sent to the applicant. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after receipt or the application is deemed approved. Any subsequent review shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. 
(5)  An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the city may, at the applicant's discretion, file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 30 small wireless facilities. If the application includes multiple small wireless facilities, an authority may separately address small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been received or which are denied. 
(6)  The city may deny a proposed collocation of a small wireless facility in the public rights-of-way if the proposed collocation: 
(i)  Materially interferes with the safe operation of traffic control equipment. 
(ii)  Materially interferes with sight lines or clear zones for transportation, pedestrians, or public safety purposes. 
(iii)  Materially interferes with compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar federal or state standards regarding pedestrian access or movement. 
(iv)  Materially fails to comply with the 2010 edition of the Florida Department of Transportation Utility Accommodation Manual, as amended. 
(v)  Fails to comply with applicable codes. 
(7)  The city may reserve space on the city's utility poles for future public safety uses. However, a reservation of space may not preclude collocation of a small wireless facility. If replacement of the city's utility pole is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small wireless facility and the future public safety use, the pole replacement is subject to make-ready provisions and the replaced pole shall accommodate the future public safety use. 
(8)  The city shall limit: 
(i)  The height of a small wireless facility to ten feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the small wireless facility is to be collocated; 
(ii)  The height for a new utility pole to the tallest existing utility pole as of July 1, 2017, that is located in the same rights-of-way measured from grade in place within 500 feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. This subsection does not include a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted. The height limitation may be waived by the city's streets department; or 
(iii)  If there is no utility pole within 500 feet, the city shall limit the height of the new utility pole to 50 feet. 
(9)  Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (8), the installation of a utility pole in the public rights-of-way designed to support a small wireless facility shall be subject to the city's rules or regulations governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way and shall be subject to the application review timeframes in this subsection. 
(10)  A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this subsection shall comply with F.S. ch. 333 and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections. 
(11)  The city may not require approval or require fees or other charges for: 
(i)  Routine maintenance; 
(ii)  Replacement of existing wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar or of the same or smaller size; or 
(iii)  Installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities that are suspended on cables strung between existing utility poles in compliance with this Ordinance by or for a communications services provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under F.S. ch. 202, otherwise fees must be remitted to the city in accordance with section 82-129(b) or (c). 
(12)  For a city utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the parties shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. § 224 and implementing regulations. The city shall not be responsible for any make-ready work costs. The good-faith estimate of the person owning or controlling the pole for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole replacement if necessary. 
(13)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. Make-ready work, including any pole replacement, must be completed by applicant within 60 days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the city may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(14)  The city may not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. Fees for make-ready work may not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications services providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and may not include any consultant fee or expense. 
(15)  A wireless provider shall, in relation to a small wireless facility, utility pole, or wireless support structure in the public rights-of-way, comply with nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements of the city, in the event the city prohibits above-ground structures in public rights-of-way, provided, however, that such undergrounding requirement shall not apply to above-grade facilities that must be located above grade specifically for the transmission or reception of electromagnetic radio frequency signals used in providing wireless services. 
(16)  A wireless infrastructure provider may apply to the city to place utility poles in the public rights-of-way to support the collocation of small wireless facilities. The application must include an attestation that small wireless facilities will be collocated on the utility pole or structure and will be used by a wireless services provider to provide service within nine months after the date the application is approved. The city shall accept and process the application in accordance with subparagraph (a)(9) and this section, any applicable codes and other local codes governing the placement of utility poles in the public rights-of-way. 
(17)  This subsection does not limit the city's authority to enforce historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7), the requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the regulations adopted to implement such laws. The city may enforce local codes, administrative rules, or regulations adopted by ordinance in effect on April 1, 2017, which are applicable to a historic area designated by the state or authority. An authority may enforce pending local ordinances, administrative rules, or regulations applicable to a historic area designated by the state if the intent to adopt such changes has been publicly declared on or before April 1, 2017. The city may waive any ordinances or other requirements that are subject to this paragraph. 
(18)  This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate or attach wireless facilities, including any antenna, micro wireless facility, or small wireless facility, on a privately-owned utility pole, a utility pole owned by an electric cooperative or a municipal electric utility, a privately owned wireless support structure, or other private property without the consent of the property owner. 
(19)  This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate or attach small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a utility pole, unless otherwise permitted by federal law, or erect a wireless support structure in the right-of-way located within a retirement community that: 
(i)  Is deed restricted as housing for older persons as defined in F.S. § 760.29(4)(b); 
(ii)  Has more than 5,000 residents; and 
(iii)  Has underground utilities for electric transmission or distribution. 
This paragraph does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities, provided that once aerial facilities are converted to underground facilities, any such collocation or construction shall be only as provided by the city's underground utilities ordinance. 
(20)  This subsection does not authorize a person to collocate small wireless facilities or micro wireless facilities on a city utility pole or erect a wireless support structure in a location subject to covenants, conditions, restrictions, articles of incorporation, and bylaws of a homeowners' association. This paragraph does not apply to the installation, placement, maintenance, or replacement of micro wireless facilities on any existing and duly authorized aerial communications facilities.

Sec. 82-132. - Termination of registration. 
(a)  The involuntary termination of a previously effective registration may only be accomplished by an action of the mayor. The mayor may declare the registration terminated and revoke and cancel all privileges granted under that registration if: 
(1)  A federal or state authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide communications service or wireless service; 
(2)  The registrant's placement and maintenance in the public rights-of-way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the public rights-of-way; or

(e)  Right to review. The city, by and through its risk management department, reserves the right to review, modify, reject or accept any required policies of insurance or self-insurance, including limits, coverages, or endorsements, herein from time to time throughout the life of this section. The city reserves the right, but not the obligation, to review and reject any insurer or self-insurer providing coverage because of its poor financial condition or failure to operate legally. 
(f)  This section shall not be construed to affect in any way the city's rights, privileges and immunities as set forth in F.S. § 768.28, as amended. Insurance under this section shall run continuously with the presence of the registrant's facilities in the public right-of-way and any termination or lapse of such insurance shall be a violation of this section and subject to the remedies as set forth herein.

Sec. 86-52. - Business tax receipt renewal. 
(a)  Authorized review upon renewal. Upon the annual renewal of all business tax receipts, the business tax administrator may review and examine any business tax receipt holder to determine if the business tax receipt holder complies with all applicable federal, state or county law or city ordinances, rules and regulations. 
(b)  A current business tax receipt may be renewed for each new business tax year by the business tax administrator without prior approval of any other departments, provided the applicant signs the following certification: 
"I the undersigned hereby certify that the business tax receipt for which I am now applying is one for a renewal of a current business tax receipt which is now in full force and effect, and that I have not changed the authorized use of the premises and do not plan to make any physical or structural changes to the premises." 
(c)  Any renewal application in which the applicant changes the authorized use of the premises or makes or proposes any physical or structural changes in the premises, shall be reviewed in the same manner as if it was an application for a new business tax receipt. 
(d)  Procedure upon denial of business tax receipt renewal. When the holder of a business tax receipt has failed to comply, follow or adhere to any applicable provision of the local business tax code, federal, state or county law or other city ordinance, rule or regulation, the business tax administrator may require such holder of the business tax receipt to apply for a new business tax receipt hereunder.

(a)  Each and every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural or manufactured), fuel oil, water service and telecommunications service shall keep at the principal place of business complete records showing all sales in the city of such commodities or service, which records shall show the price charged upon such sale, the amount of taxes charged upon each sale, the date of the sale, the date of payment thereof, the date such tax was remitted to the city, the period of time covered by such remittance and other related information that may be required to verify proper collection and remittance of the taxes. 
(b)  To ensure proper administration of this article, the city may, where possible and practical, conduct a periodic audit of the sales records of all businesses in connection with which the tax is imposed under this article. Failure to conduct such an audit will not eliminate the liability of the seller for collection and remittance of the tax. 
(c)  Pursuant to F.S. § 166.234, the city may, during the seller's normal business hours at the official location of the seller's books and records, audit the records of any seller of a service that is taxable by the city under F.S. § 166.231 or 166.232 for the purpose of ascertaining whether taxable services have been provided or the correctness of any return that has been filed or payment that has been made, if the city's power to assess the tax or grant a refund is not barred by the applicable limitations period. Each such seller must provide to the city, upon 60 days' written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this 60-day period must be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the 60-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than 30 days before the existing extension expires, except for a bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party. In an audit the seller is liable only for its taxable accounts collected that correspond to the information provided to it by the city under F.S. § 166.233(3). As used in this subsection, the term "applicable records" means records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due. Applicable records may be provided to the city on an electronic medium if agreed to by the seller and the city. In accordance with F.S. § 166.231(9)(c), any information received by the city or its agent in connection with such audit is confidential and exempt from the provisions of F.S. § 119.07(1).

In addition, penalties will be assessed at a rate of five percent per month of the delinquent tax, not to exceed a total penalty of 25 percent, except that in no event will the penalty for failure to file a return be less than $15.00. For a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax shall be liable for a specific penalty of 100 percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. The interest and penalties shall accrue from the due date until the date such taxes are paid; provided, however, that the city treasurer may settle or compromise any interest due pursuant to this section as is reasonable under the circumstances.

No credits will be granted where negative test results are found. The test procedures described in this section shall be followed on all retests together with payment of the application fee. 
(f)  The quantity of water recorded by the meter shall be conclusive on both the customer and the department except when the meter has been found to be defective or ceases to register. If the meter has been found to be defective or has ceased to register, the quantity of water supplied since the last reading shall be determined by the average registration of another meter for a period of 60 days, or of the same meter for a like period after it has been repaired and tested; or by mutual agreement the quantity of water supplied may be prorated upon the previous corresponding period from the date of the last reading preceding the time the meter has been or become defective or has failed to register to the time such meter is repaired or replaced. 
(g)  If a customer has an outstanding balance due over 30 calendar days and the customer has not made proper arrangements with the department to pay the outstanding balance upon written notice to the customer and the customer given an opportunity to pay within 30 days or agree to pay the outstanding balance through a payment plan acceptable to the city, the department may remove the meter and plug the line unless the customer pays the outstanding balance, including the cost of the removal and reinstallation of the meter and the plug.

(i)  A customer may request that the department verify a reading if the customer has specific reason to believe that the actual reading taken is in error. If the department at the customer's request establishes that the reading taken is correct, the customer shall pay the department a fee of $25.00 for such services. If it is concluded that the reading is in error, the customer will not be charged for this service and the bill will be adjusted accordingly.

All other individually-metered residential development requiring services greater than the size referenced in this section shall be determined in accordance with the ERC application methodology discussed in this section for non-residential service. 
b.  Master-metered residential service- Each dwelling unit served by a master meter shall be considered one ERC for each applicable service requested by the owner or applicant. If the development served by the master meter includes nonresidential use, then the capital charge for such nonresidential use will be determined in addition to the applicable master-metered residential service. 
c.  Nonresidential service- As part of the application and approval process for the issuance of a building permit, the owner or applicant must provide an estimate of the average dependable daily water and wastewater capacity that will be approved by the city prior to the issuance of such building permit.

Water Capital Charge = Average Dependable Daily 
Capacity Expressed on a 
gallon per day basis _____× $2,975.00 350  
Wastewater Capital Charge = Average Dependable Daily 
Capacity Expressed on a 
gallon per day basis _____× $966.00 350  
All ERC values shall be calculated to the nearest tenth (0.1 ERC) for fee application purposes, but in no event shall a capital charge for water and/or wastewater service be calculated at less than one ERC. 
d.  With respect to the determination of the water and wastewater capital charges for non-residential development, if no water and wastewater capacity estimates are provided, the city reserves the right to estimate the average dependable daily capacity as referenced in this section and determine the appropriate capital charge to be charged to such owner or applicant. 
e.  The city reserves the right to review the amount of water and/or wastewater consumption during the life of a customer's service and shall bill to the owner or applicant any adjustment to the water and wastewater capital charges for capacity use in excess of amounts that have been paid by the owner or applicant. Any additional capital charge payments shall be billed to the owner or applicant at the then applicable capital charge amount. 
(e)  Payment of capital charges. 
(1)  Except as otherwise expressed provided in this ordinance, prior to the issuance of a building permit where applicable, all applicants or owners, as the case may be, shall pay the water and/or wastewater capital charges as established herein. 
(2)  Collection of fees when building permit is issued by mistake or inadvertence; lien.

(iii)  That the capital charge shall be delinquent if not paid and received by the city within 60 calendar days of the date of the capital charge statement notice if a hearing is not requested pursuant to subsection (e)(2)b.(ii) above and, upon becoming delinquent, shall be subject to the imposition of a delinquent fee and interest on the unpaid amount until paid. 
(iv)  That if the capital charge becomes delinquent, a lien against the property for which the building permit was secured shall be recorded in the official records book of Miami-Dade County. 
c.  The capital charge shall be delinquent if, within 60 calendar days from the date of the capital charge statement notice, or the date such notice was attached to the building permit, neither the capital charges have been paid and received by the city, nor a hearing request pursuant to subsection (e)(2)b.(ii) above. In the event a hearing is requested pursuant to subsection (e)(2)b.(ii) above, the capital charges shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 calendar days from the date the special master determines the amount of capital charges due upon the conclusion of such hearing. The time periods shall be calculated on a calendar day basis, without exception, but excluding the date of the capital charge statement notice of the hearing date of the special master's decision in the event of an appeal. In the event the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the last due date prior to becoming delinquent shall be the next business day. Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten percent of the total fee imposed shall be assessed.

(h)  Alternative capital charge calculation. 
(1)  If an applicant or owner believes that the impact to the water and/or wastewater systems necessitated by new development is less than the impact established herein, such applicant or owner may submit a calculation of an alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges to the director of the department of water and sewers pursuant to the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Any right to submit an alternative method of calculating the water and/or wastewater systems capital charges shall be deemed to have been waived, expired, and such calculations shall be rejected by the city if not properly and timely made prior to the issuance of a building permit for the respective construction. 
(3)  Upon timely submission of an alternative method of calculating the water and/or wastewater systems capital charges, the basis therefore and receipt of the alternative the calculation of water and/or wastewater systems capital charges, the department director shall review the calculation within 90 calendar days after receipt. 
If the department director determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the owner or applicant to calculate the alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges complies with requirements of this section and that the alternative water and/or wastewater capital charges were calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, then the alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges shall be paid in lieu of the capital charge set forth in this section. 
If the department director determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the owner or applicant to calculate the alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges does not comply with the requirements of this section, or is otherwise not equitable, or that the alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges were not calculated by the use of a generally accepted methodology, then the city shall mail to the owner or applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges stating the reason therefore. 
(4)  If the owner or applicant does not agree with the recommendations of the department director, the owner or applicant shall have the right to appeal the recommendation before a special master at a scheduled public hearing.

(5)  Any applicant or owner who submits a proposed alternative water and/or wastewater systems capital charges pursuant to this section and desires immediate issuance of a building permit shall pay, prior to or at the time, the applicable water and/or wastewater systems capital charges pursuant to section 94-162. Such payments shall be deemed to be paid under "protest" and shall not be construed as a waiver of any right of review. Any difference, if any, between the amount paid and the amount due, as determined by the city, shall be refunded to the applicant or owner within 30 calendar days of the city's final decision thereon. 
(i)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of capital charges: 
(1)  Alterations or expansions of then existing buildings, structure, or improvement where no additional demand on the water and/or wastewater systems is or will be created by such alterations or expansions. 
(2)  The construction of accessory buildings, structures, or improvements that will not create an additional demand on either the water and/or wastewater systems. 
(3)  The replacement of then existing building, structure, or improvement which has previously been subjected to capital charges payable to the city and where no additional demand is or will be created by that replacement on either the water and/or wastewater systems. 
(4)  Buildings, structures, or improvements, either then existing or which then have been issued a building permit for which construction is proceeding in good faith, previously served by a utility service provided other than the city, provided that at the time the city formally resolves to acquire that utility, the city council expressly declares its intention to operate such utility as a component of the construction of water and/or wastewater systems. 
(j)  Additional policies related to capital contributions. 
(1)  Manner of paying; payment prerequisite to rendering service. The city requires the payment of contributions in aid of construction, either by cash payments or through the installation of water distribution and wastewater collection facilities by the developer, builder or property owner, the title to such facilities transferred to the city, or a combination of both forms of contributions. The requirement of the city for such contributions is declared to be for the purpose of defraying the cost of the water and wastewater systems. The payment by the developer, builder and/or owner of such contributions to the city shall be a condition precedent to the rendering of service by the city. 
(2)  Computation. In addition to the capital charges set forth above, the aggregate value of capital contributions required by the city, either in cash or by utility facilities construction donated to the city, shall be computed and determined as set forth in subsection (3) below. 
(3)  On-site facilities. Each developer, owner or builder (hereinafter referred to as developer) shall be responsible for the design, installation, inspection and testing of complete distribution facilities and collection facilities located in the street or streets, facilities' rights-of-way or easements adjoining or within the boundaries of the developer's property, or the equivalent cost of the same in the event such facilities have been previously designed and/or installed. The city's requirement for the installation of oversized lines or facilities, located on the developer's property and designed to provide service for other properties, shall be the subject of a developer's agreement to be negotiated with the city. 
(4)  Off-site facilities. The developer is required to extend service to the city's water and wastewater transmission facilities. For the purpose of this extension policy, the term "off-site" shall be defined as those distribution facilities, water transmission facilities, wastewater transmission facilities, collection facilities and/or pumping stations necessary to connect the developer's property with facilities of the city adequate in size to transmit to the developer's property an adequate quantity of water under adequate pressure and/or transmit wastewater collected on the developer's property to the treatment plant or disposal site of the city. The physical location of such off-site facilities may, in fact, be within the geographic boundaries of the developer's property; however, such geographic location shall not change the character of said off-site facilities since the same relates to major transmission and collection facilities serving major developed areas or more than one developer's property. It is the city's policy to apportion the cost of the off-site facilities pro rata against the properties receiving service from such off-site facilities using the refundable advance approach. Since each developer draws from the hydraulic capacity of such facilities, the city will require that the developer install such facilities and pay the developer's property's hydraulic share as a minimum of the cost of the off-site facilities through which service is rendered to the developer's property. Developers are required to advance all or a portion of the off-site facilities in order to provide a physical interconnection of the developer's property with the facilities of the city at their then present terminus. 
(5)  Utility standards, policies and procedure. All on-site and off-site facilities shall be designed and constructed in accordance with city utility standards, policies, and procedures, as amended from time to time. 
(k)  Customer metering. 
(1)  The decision of size, type, quantity and installation of meters for any given customer or property shall be within the sole discretion of the city. The general rule or policy of the city shall be that each dwelling unit or business shall be provided with its own meter. Nevertheless, the city may determine that a different, alternative metering arrangement is acceptable within its sole discretion. At a minimum, however, approval of any such alternative metering arrangement shall be subject to payment of (1) applicable water capital charges based upon projected ERC usage; and (2) payment of monthly base service charges for projected ERCs. 
(2)  Commercial and industrial structures shall be expressed as equivalent single-family residential units on the basis of the relative capacities of water meters serving the structures. Meter sizes and the corresponding number of equivalent single-family residential units are tabulated below: 
Meter Size Equivalencies (ERCs) 5/8? 1.0 1.0? 2.5 1.5? 5.0 2.0? 8.0 3.0? 16.0 4.0? 25.0 6.0? 50.0 8.0? 80.0 10.0? 115.0 12.0? 241.0

Sec. 94-163. - Water and wastewater payment in lieu of franchise fee. 
    The city hereby adopts a water and wastewater payment in lieu of franchise fee applicable to all sales of water and wastewater service by the city in an amount equal to no less than seven and one-half percent and no greater than ten percent of the bi-monthly rates, fees, and charges (including base facility and consumption rates) from the sale of water and wastewater service to customers of the city's water and wastewater system. The rate for the sale of water and the rate for wastewater service shall be established each fiscal year and adopted concurrently with the adoption of the annual budget for the utility. If there is no change in either rate from the current fiscal year to the next fiscal year, the city shall reaffirm the rates by resolution. If there is an upward or downward adjustment to either rate from the current fiscal year to the next, the city shall adopt the change by separate ordinance. The city shall provide public notice of the proposed action pursuant to F.S. § 166.041(3)(a). The city's water and wastewater utility will budget and transfer to the general fund this payment in lieu of franchise fee on a monthly basis.

Sec. 98-346. - Required. 
    Except as provided in section 98-349 of this Code, it shall be unlawful to subdivide any property within the city or to open, grade, or improve any streets therein or to erect, have constructed or cause to be constructed any residence or other structure on any unplatted land, until a plat of such proposed subdivision shall have first been approved by the planning and zoning board and city council. 
(Code 1960, § 32-3; Ord. No. 2669, § 2, 11-14-1972; Ord. No. 2727, § 1, 4-10-1973; Ord. No. 82-43, § 1, 5-11-1982; Ord. No. 96-60, § 1, 6-25-1996; Ord. No. 2018-032, § 1, 5-8-2018) 
Sec. 98-347. - Criteria for approval. 
    No plat or replat required by this division shall be approved until the following requirements have been met: 
(1)  Tentative plat. A tentative plat to be approved by the planning and zoning board showing all lots, streets, and alleys, together with their dimensions, as well as connecting adjoining streets and the elevation of the land in such subdivision to be expressed in feet above the mean sea level (United States Coastal and Geodetic Survey datum). The elevations may be shown as contours at one-foot intervals. 
(2)  Final plat. The final plat shall comply with the requirements of F.S. ch. 177. 
(3)  Agreement; bond. Every person submitting plats to the planning and zoning board and the city council for approval shall accompany such plat with an agreement providing for the paving of the streets; the construction of the sidewalks and drainage structures; and the installation of adequate water mains, fire hydrants, street lighting and such other improvements as the council deems necessary in such subdivision, which installations shall be in accordance with the specifications as set forth by the city council. The agreement shall be accompanied by a surety bond in the sum of not less than 110 percent of the estimated cost of such construction. Such agreement shall be approved by the city council and the city clerk. The condition of this bond shall be such that the principal shall fully and faithfully perform all the terms and conditions of the principal's agreement and within the time specified therein. Such bond shall be released by the city only upon satisfactory completion of the work specified in the agreement as evidenced by written certification by the city engineer, including certification that the elevations of all pavements, sidewalks and fills comply with this chapter. This agreement may stipulate such time limits, as the city council shall require, for the various installations specified therein. The agreement and surety bond shall be of such forms and conditions as required by the streets department, and both agreement and surety bond shall be held by the streets department. 
(4)  Lot sizes. All building sites and lots in residential districts shall have a minimum width of 75 feet and a minimum depth of 100 feet, except that lots in R-4 townhouse districts shall have a minimum width of 22 feet and a minimum depth of 100 feet, and all building sites or lots in commercial or business districts shall have a minimum width of 45 feet and a minimum depth of 100 feet. The purpose and intent of this subsection is to prevent the reduction in size of lots and tracts or parcels of land from being redivided to parcels of less than the minimum required in this subsection. It is not intended to prevent lots in existence at the time of passage of the ordinance from which this chapter derives from being increased in size or width, even though such increase does not reach the prescribed minimum. 
(5)  Street lighting. 
a.  The city will accept ownership of all streetlights located on city (publicly dedicated) street rights-of-way and will thereafter be responsible for their maintenance and fuel cost under the following conditions: 
1.  All plats in reference to street lighting will be referred to Florida Power and Light Company for its recommendations for an adequate lighting system and point of service for all lights to be located on city (publicly dedicated) street rights-of-way. 
2.  All lights must be mercury vapor of not less than 4,500 lumina. 
3.  All poles must be concrete. 
4.  Florida Power and Light Company will relamp the lights on city (publicly dedicated) street rights-of-way as part of its fuel cost of luminaries meeting its specifications. 
5.  All wiring must be underground. 
6.  All developers must expect a minimum of 60 days for approval of a street lighting plan. 
b.  Lighting of interior areas. 
1.  The city recommends that adequate lighting be provided by the developer for all sites that are not located on public rights-of-way. 
2.  The city will not accept ownership, maintenance or fuel cost for any lights not located on city (publicly dedicated) street rights-of-way. 
c.  All other improvements shall be according to the requirements of platting of Miami-Dade County. 
(6)  Payment of taxes, liens, assessments. The payment of all municipal taxes, municipal liens and municipal assessments is required prior to the approval of any plat. No land shall be divided or subdivided by plat nor shall the plat be approved by the mayor and city council until all municipal taxes, municipal liens and municipal assessments have been paid. 
(7)  Filing fee. The payment of a filing fee is required upon submission of an application for approval of a plat. The required base filing fee is $750.00 for low density residential development with an additional fee of $25.00 for each lot identified in the plat. The required base filing fee is $750.00 for multiple family residential development with an additional fee of $10.00 for each residential unit within the boundaries of the plat. The required base filing fee for commercial and industrial development is $1,500.00 with an additional fee of $100.00 for each acre or fraction thereof within the boundaries of the plat. The filing fee is intended to defray the cost of review and consideration of approval by the city of a tentative plat and final plat.

No building permits shall be issued for the erection of future structures on existing legally divided parcels of unimproved land in R-1 and R-2 zones unless they shall be at least an average of 40 feet wide and shall have an area of at least 6,480 square feet. However, whenever it shall appear that an owner or his predecessors in title owned a legally divided parcel of land having an area less than 6,480 square feet and more than 5,100 square feet with a minimum average width of at least 40 feet and a minimum average depth of at least 100 feet on February 26, 1974, and if it shall appear that the owner or his predecessors in title owned no other adjacent property at such time or since such time, a building permit shall be issued provided that at least 50 percent or more of the block containing such parcel is presently divided into building sites occupied by existing single-family or duplex homes with lot widths and areas equal to or less than that for which the building permit has been applied. Further, building permits may be issued for the erection of future structures on existing legally divided parcels of unimproved land in R-1 zones if such lots are at least an average of 40 feet in width and are an average of at least 125 feet in depth, and provided, further, that such future structures are to maintain a 30-foot front yard setback, a 25-foot rear yard setback, and five-foot one-inch side setbacks. Provisions of Ordinance No. 83-51, amending section 98-500 pertaining to front yard requirements in R-1 one-family districts, shall not be applicable to structures built on 40-foot lots permitted to be built upon under this section. 
No building permit shall be issued for any proposed structure on a legally divided residential parcel of land where the width is less than 40 feet or the depth is less than 100 feet or the area is less than 5,100 square feet without a variance permit except lots in R-4 townhouse districts and R-Z zero lot line development districts. 
(b)  Blocks. No plat of any subdivision in R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 residential zones shall be accepted by the city with any section, tract, block or other description that would be in excess of 600 lineal feet, unless the such plat backs up to a lake, canal, railroad, or Florida Power and Light Company easement or right-of-way or tracts of public property. 
(c)  Flood hazard disclosure. All subdivision plats shall include an engineer's or surveyor's statement as to which lots, if any, are partially or completely located in an area of special flood hazard identified pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended from time to time.

Sec. 98-349. - Unity of title; covenant in lieu thereof. 
    A subdivision of plat is not required in the BDH business development district for division of land into separate parcels, provided that all applications for building permits where multiple buildings are proposed for a single site be accompanied by one of the following documents: 
(1)  A unity of title, approved for legal form and sufficiency by the city attorney, which shall run with the land and be binding upon the heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns, and upon all mortgagees or lessees and others presently or in the future having any interest in the property; or 
(2)  A declaration of restrictive covenants, approved for legal form and sufficiency by the city attorney, which shall run with the land and be binding upon the heirs, successors, personal representatives and assigns, and upon all mortgagees and lessees and others presently or in the future having any interest in the property. The declaration shall contain the following necessary elements: 
(a)  That the subject site will be developed in substantial accordance with the approved site plan. That no modification shall be effectuated without the written consent of the zoning director and the then owner(s) of the phase or portion of the property for which modification is sought; provided the zoning director finds that the modification would not generate excessive noise or traffic, tend to create a fire or other equally or greater dangerous hazard, or provoke excessive overcrowding of people, or tend to provoke a nuisance, or be incompatible with the area concerned, when considering the necessity and reasonableness of the modification in relation to the present and future development of the area concerned. Should the zoning director withhold such approval, the then owner(s) of the phase or portion of the property for which modification is sought shall be permitted to seek such modification by application to modify the plan or covenant at public hearing before the planning and zoning board or the city council of the City of Hialeah (whichever by law has jurisdiction over such matters). 
(b)  That if the subject property will be developed in phases, that each phase will be developed in substantial accordance with the site plan. 
(c)  That in the event of multiple ownerships subsequent to site plan approval, that each of the subsequent owners shall be bound by the terms, provisions and conditions of the declaration of restrictive covenants. The owner shall further agree that he or she will not convey portions of the subject property to such other parties unless and until the owner and such other party (parties) shall have executed and mutually delivered, in recordable form, an instrument to be known as an "easement and operating agreement" which shall contain, among other things: 
(i)  Easements in the common area of each parcel for ingress to and egress from the other parcels; 
(ii)  Easements in the common area of each parcel for the passage and parking of vehicles; 
(iii)  Easements in the common area of each parcel for the passage and accommodation of pedestrians; 
(iv)  Easements for access roads across the common area of each parcel to public and private roadways; 
(v)  Easements for the installation, use, operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, relocation and removal of utility facilities in appropriate areas in each such parcel; 
(vi)  Easements on each such parcel for construction of buildings and improvements in favor of each such other parcel; 
(vii)  Easements upon each such parcel in favor of each adjoining parcel for the installation, use, maintenance, repair, replacement and removal of common construction improvements such as footings, supports and foundations; 
(viii)  Easements on each parcel for attachment of buildings; 
(ix)  Easements on each parcel for building overhangs and other overhangs and projections encroaching upon such parcel from adjoining parcel such as, by way of example, marquees, canopies, lights, lighting devices, awnings, wing walls and the like; 
(x)  Appropriate reservation of rights to grant easements to utility companies; 
(xi)  Appropriate reservation of rights to road right-of-ways and curb cuts; 
(xii)  Easements in favor of each such parcel for pedestrian and vehicular traffic over dedicated private ring roads and access roads; and 
(xiii)  Appropriate agreements between the owners of the several parcels as to the obligation to maintain and repair all private roadways, parking facilities, common areas and common facilities and the like. 
These provisions or portions thereof may be waived by the zoning director if they are not applicable to the subject property. These provisions of the easement and operating agreement shall not be amended without prior written approval of the city attorney. In addition, such easement and operating agreement shall contain such other provisions with respect to the operation, maintenance and development of the property as to which the parties thereto may agree, all to the end that although the property may have several owners, it will be constructed, conveyed, maintained and operated in accordance with the approved site plan. 
Nonuse variances created solely by separate ownerships, pursuant to subsection (2)(c) shall be waived by the zoning director. 
(d)  The declaration of restrictive covenants shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the documents are recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County, Florida, after which time they shall be extended automatically for successive periods of ten years unless released in writing by the then owners of the property, provided that the same is also approved by the city council and the mayor of the city, or its successors, by resolution, upon advertised notice, or by ordinance if the covenant is adopted by ordinance or as otherwise provided in the city charter, upon the demonstration and affirmative finding that the same is no longer necessary to preserve and protect the property for the purposes herein intended. 
(e)  Enforcement of the declaration of restrictive covenants shall be by action at law or in equity with costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party.

Sec. 98-376. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Nonconforming use means a lawful use of property that is considered nonconforming if its continued use varies from the requirements of articles I through VI of this chapter. A nonconforming use may continue on property subject to this article. A nonconforming use shall not be based on causal, temporary or illegal uses of property. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 18, 1-26-1954; Code 1960, § 32-25(a); Ord. No. 96-59, § 1, 6-25-1996) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 98-377. - Limitations. 
(a)  A nonconforming use may not be enlarged, intensified, increased or extended to occupy a greater area in any direction nor shall such use be replaced by another use not specifically permitted in the zoning district concerned. Land that has a nonconforming use may neither be subdivided nor improved with a structure or building. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the limitations in subsection (a) of this section, a variance may be granted for an enlarged, intensified, increased or an extended nonconforming use if it is determined that such use is more compatible with the surrounding properties and area than at the time when the use became nonconforming and if it does not adversely affect or impact the public interest. Compliance with the current requirements of the city fire prevention code and building code is mandatory for such approved uses. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 18, 1-26-1954; Code 1960, § 32-25(b)(1); Ord. No. 96-59, § 1, 6-25-1996) 
Sec. 98-378. - Discontinuance. 
    Under this chapter, nonconforming uses that are discontinued for more than 90 consecutive days or for 180 days within a one-year period shall terminate and no longer exist. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 18, 1-26-1954; Code 1960, § 32-25(b)(2); Ord. No. 96-59, § 1, 6-25-1996) 
Sec. 98-379. - Termination. 
    Under this chapter, nonconforming uses may be terminated by a five-sevenths vote of the city council by ordinance if the continuation of the nonconforming use adversely affects the health, safety and welfare of the city; provided, however, that due consideration is given to the rights of the property owner in providing a reasonable time for compliance with current regulations. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 18, 1-26-1954; Code 1960, § 32-25(b)(3); Ord. No. 96-59, § 1, 6-25-1996) 
Sec. 98-380. - Undeveloped or vacant subdivided land. 
(a)  Individual platted lots. Except as provided in subsection 98-348(a), if an individual lot has been legally subdivided pursuant to a plat recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter derives, as amended, the individual lot, if lawful at the time of recording, becomes a nonconforming use if it varies from the requirements of this chapter, as amended; provided, however, that the lot owner does not own a lot abutting the individual lot. If the lot owner owns an abutting lot, the requirements of this chapter, as amended, must be satisfied. 
(b)  Two or more platted lots or parts thereof. Except as provided in subsection 98-348(a), a nonconforming use will not be allowed if two or more contiguous lots or portions of lots with continuous frontage are owned by the same person. The property owner must comply with the current requirements of this chapter, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 771, § 18, 1-26-1954; Code 1960, § 32-25(c); Ord. No. 96-59, § 1, 6-25-1996; Ord. No. 99-71, § 2(32-25), 5-25-1999) 
Sec. 98-381. - Developed property. 
(a)  Restoration or replacement permitted. If a building or structure contains a nonconforming use, removal or destruction of the building or structure terminates the nonconformity. Destruction shall mean damage to an extent that repair or renovation would amount to 50 percent or more, or 25 percent or more if damage is structural, of the value of the building or structure as determined by the building official according to the standards set forth in the South Florida Building Code, as amended. Where damage is less than 50 percent or less than 25 percent if damage is structural of the value determination, the building or structure may be restored or renovated to the same or lesser size in the same location; provided, however, that restoration commences within six months of date of damage and is diligently completed. 
(b)  Individual platted lots. For individual platted lots, the same regulations shall apply as provided for undeveloped or vacant subdivided land in section 98-380. 
(c)  Two or more platted lots or parts thereof. For two or more platted lots or parts thereof, the same regulations shall apply as provided for undeveloped or vacant subdivided land in section 98-380.

The property owner shall obtain a building permit within six months of receipt of proceeds or funds to commence construction in effecting the cure. The duty to cure shall extend to successors in interest if the property owner sells, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of the property prior to curing the property.

Sec. 98-415. - Certificate of re-occupancy. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to buy, sell, convey or transfer title to any single-family, duplex or townhouse dwelling without first obtaining a re-occupancy certificate issued by the building official, code compliance director or designee. The certificate of re-occupancy, if issued, shall state that the city has inspected the dwelling and determined that the dwelling complies with the residential occupancy regulations of the zoning district on the property wherein the dwelling unit is located. In A, R-1, R-Z and R-4 zoning districts, a certificate of re-occupancy shall not be issued for the presence or existence of more than one dwelling or residence. In R-2 zoning districts, a certificate of re-occupancy will not be issued for the presence or existence of three or more dwellings or residences. In R-3, R-3-1, R-3-2, R-3-3, R-3-4, R-3-5 and R-3-D zoning districts, a certificate of re-occupancy of a townhouse shall not be issued for the presence or existence of more than one dwelling or residence. In R-3, R-3-1, R-3-2, R-3-3, R-3-4, R-3-5 and R-3-D zoning districts, a certificate of re-occupancy of a duplex will not be issued for the presence or existence of three or more dwellings or residences. The provisions of this section shall not apply to the sale, conveyance or transfer of title of a new dwelling or residence that has never been occupied and that represents the first transaction since the issuance of the original certificate of occupancy. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, convey or transfer title to any single-family, duplex or townhouse dwelling unit owned by such person without first disclosing by written notice to the buyer, grantee or transferee the fact that a certificate of re-occupancy is required by this section. It is required that a seller, grantor or transferor deliver to the buyer, grantee or transferee a properly signed and approved city certificate of re-occupancy prior to the sale, conveyance or transfer of title to property zoned A, R-1, R-2, R-Z and R-4; and to property zoned R-3, R-3-1, R-3-2, R-3-3, R-3-4, R-3-5 and R-3-D, if the dwelling unit is a townhouse or duplex. 
(c)  A seller, property owner or designated agent shall request a certificate of re-occupancy by submitting a completed application together with payment of an inspection fee. Upon payment of a $100.00 inspection fee, a city inspector shall inspect the dwelling within 30 days and, if such dwelling is found to be in compliance with the residential occupancy regulations of the applicable zoning district, the city will issue a certificate of re-occupancy. Upon payment of a $300.00 inspection fee, a city inspector shall inspect the dwelling on an expedited basis within ten days and, if such dwelling is found to be in compliance with the residential occupancy regulations of the applicable zoning district, the city will issue a certificate of re-occupancy. A $75.00 fee shall be paid for each re-inspection performed by the city. The re-occupancy certificate shall be effective for six months and may be extended only one time for an additional six months upon payment of a $100.00 fee. Upon a real estate closing or title transfer the certificate of re-occupancy shall be recorded in the Miami-Dade County public records with the deed or other conveyance of title. 
(d)  If a dwelling violates the residential occupancy regulations of the applicable zoning district, the city shall identify the violations of such regulations. Until there is compliance or correction of the violation of the residential occupancy regulations confirmed upon re-inspection, the certificate of re-occupancy will be withheld. 
(e)  Under circumstances where remedial action may reasonably extend beyond the date of the sale, conveyance or transfer to complete, the city shall issue conditional certificates of re-occupancy with a compliance date set forth in the certificate. If the proposed remedial action includes correction of violations that immediately threaten the life or safety of the residents as listed in the certificate, the city shall identify such violations on the conditional certificate of occupancy. Upon compliance, the city shall issue a re-occupancy certificate. If a property is sold, conveyed or transferred in a subsequent transaction and the remedial action required in the conditional certificate of re-occupancy issued pursuant to this paragraph has not been completed within the compliance date and no re-occupancy certificate has been issued prior to the subsequent sale, conveyance or transfer, the inspection fee shall be $300.00. A city inspector shall inspect the dwelling within 30 days. A city inspector shall inspect the dwelling on an expedited basis within ten days upon payment of an additional $100.00 fee. 
(f)  Information gained or conditions observed in the course of any inspection conducted pursuant to the authority of this article, shall not be utilized by the code inspectors as the basis for issuing new citations or notices of violation other than violations of the residential occupancy regulations permitted by the applicable zoning district. This shall not preclude other enforcement actions brought upon the basis of information gained or violations observed by other lawful means. 
(g)  The certificate of re-occupancy does not constitute any representation or warranty as to the condition or any aspect of such condition of the dwelling or other structures on the premises for which the certificate is issued.

The presence or appearance of a second or additional one-family residence as indicated by the installation and/or use of additional fixtures or appliances or as indicated by the inaccessibility of habitable rooms to each other shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that this section has been violated. Existing guesthouses, formerly referred to as "servants' quarters", properly permitted, are allowed to continue as a legal nonconforming use. 
(b)  Exception. 
(1)  Applicability. A second living quarters may be allowed only if the residence is located in an R-1 (one-family district) and if all of the habitable rooms are accessible to each other, but only for one additional family unit for immediate family members of the property owner comprising of one grandparent or set of grandparents; one parent or one set of parents; one child and/or the child's spouse and/or dependent children; one grandchild and/or the grandchild's spouse and/or dependent children.

(2)  Application. The property owner shall apply to the planning division to obtain permission for second living quarters. The property owner shall complete an application, together with a $200.00 inspection fee, with a copy of a current homestead exemption receipt, floor plan of the layout of the interior of the residence and a site plan sketch of the property including the location where personal motor vehicles will be parked on the paved areas within the property, and sufficient documentary proof, such as a passport or birth certificate, to demonstrate the required family relationship between the property owner and the occupants of the second living quarters. If the property owner does not possess a current homestead exemption receipt, the city shall confirm the status of the homestead exemption from a review of the county tax rolls. If the city approves the second living quarters, then the city shall charge a waste collection fee of 11/2 times the single household residential rate. 
(3)  Renewal. Each year after the city approves the second living quarters, on or before the anniversary date of the first approval, the property owner shall renew the approved second living quarters for an additional year, upon reinspection of the premises and payment of a $100.00 reinspection fee. 
(4)  Limitations. 
a.  The second family living quarters may include a stove, microwave, hot plate, refrigerator, air conditioning unit and floor and wall cabinets. 
b.  Building permits will be required for an additional bathroom, plumbing pipes, valves, electrical alterations and exterior doors.

d.  All residents must park personal motor vehicles on paved areas within the physical boundaries of the property or if approved by the city, on paved swale areas. 
e.  Accessory buildings and detached structures, unless a guesthouse properly permitted at the time of construction for use as a guesthouse, may not be used for additional living quarters. 
f.  When the property is sold and the transaction requires a certificate of re-occupancy, then the second living quarters with the additional fixtures and appliances and second kitchen facilities must be removed.

DIVISION 26. - TOD TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Sec. 98-1536. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the TOD transit oriented development district is to provide regulations to promote compact, pedestrian friendly, mixed-use development with appropriate urban design and architectural guidelines within walking distance of high capacity rapid transit stations. These regulations are intended to enhance livability and mobility by increasing residential options, enhancing the street experience for all modes of transportation, creating public open spaces and promoting the establishment of businesses oriented to commuters and residents. The criteria and incentives provided herein only apply to properties located within a half-mile of Tri-Rail stations in the city that have transit oriented development district land use designation and transit oriented development district zoning classification. 
(Ord. No. 2016-64, § 1, 10-25-2016)

The TOD transit oriented development district regulations take precedence only if the property owner develops the property according to the expanded uses that are available in the TOD transit oriented development district. This section does not prevent a property owner from developing its property according to the current zoning regulations of the underlying zoning district designation for the property if no expanded uses or allowances are proposed. 
(Ord. No. 2016-64, § 1, 10-25-2016) 
Sec. 98-1538. - Goals and objectives. 
    The overall goal and objective of the TOD transit oriented development district is to foster quality developments that would make the areas around mass transit stations more vibrant and sustainable places for people to live, work, play and commute while ensuring that users have attractive, comfortable, safe and direct access to the mass transit stations. The transit stations shall be the prominent feature of the district surrounded by active public spaces and shall serve as the catalyst for major redevelopment. Specific goals and objectives include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  Implement complete streets by establishing setback requirements that would allow for right-of-way re-configurations that include wider sidewalks, landscape buffers, bike lanes and parallel parking in addition to vehicular traffic lanes. 
(b)  Promote compact vertical and horizontal mix of uses including residential and compatible commercial uses embedded in the district. 
(c)  Encourage a variety of housing types and sizes and increase density to incentivize development. 
(d)  Reduce parking requirements and encourage shared parking, riding and driving alternatives to diminish car dependency while promoting pedestrian connections and sustainable vehicular usage.

(Ord. No. 2016-64, § 1, 10-25-2016) 
Sec. 98-1546. - Parking improvement trust fund. 
    A parking improvement trust fund shall be established for the purpose of subsidizing the acquisition, construction and operation of parking facilities, marketing transit and parking facilities, funding right-of-way improvements related to parking and transit, and associated administrative expenses that would allow the mitigation of the reduced of parking requirements. 
(a)  Parking improvement trust fund. The parking improvement trust fund shall be maintained and administered by the streets department. Funds shall be deposited into the parking improvement trust fund, and subsequently used to facilitate parking purposes within the area including, but not limited to, public off-street parking, infrastructure improvements and maintenance and marketing to serve the Hialeah Transfer Station Subdistrict through means that may include but are not limited to the following activities:

(Ord. No. 2016-64, § 1, 10-25-2016) 
Sec. 98-1548. - Architectural standards. 
    To achieve a transit-oriented district and its character, architectural elements as provided in this section shall be required. New development within the district shall, to the greatest extent practicable, utilize the following architectural elements illustrated herein: 
(a)  Materials. For small scale retail building facades and large, uninterrupted volumes of retail in the district, at least three different materials shall be used in each building elevation in addition to some surface relief. Creative and innovative high quality building materials are encouraged. This includes metals, perforated materials, glass, and architectural concrete. Reflective glass as a complete surface is discouraged. Faux treatments in lieu of the intended material are discouraged. 
(b)  Fenestration. Street level building facades shall be pierced by single and double height windows or general access entrance or doorways to encourage browsing and window shopping. For the first ten feet of height above the public sidewalk elevation, the exterior building wall shall contain windows and/or doorways of transparent glass covering at least 50 percent of the linear frontage of the building (to be measured at least thirty inches above the sidewalk). Additionally, the base of all transparent openings shall be no more than 30 inches above the sidewalk. The individual panes may be composed of smaller vertical elements. To reduce visual barriers between interior and exterior spaces street level windows shall be transparent with no reflectivity. Similarly, storefront and display windows shall not be filled in or blocked in any way. Street level restaurants are encouraged to use operable windows and doors which can allow them to open out onto the sidewalks in good weather. 
(c)  Scaling elements. Large, blank surfaces and non-modular panels, such as concrete panels and stucco, are discouraged unless they have a compelling design purpose. This is especially true at the ground floor level which requires additional detail and visual amenities. Repeating elements, such as pilasters, vertical reveals, and other three dimensional details shall be strongest at the street level. They may include repetition of storefront details or consistent sign design. For large commercial buildings in the district, at least one architectural element shall be repeated to minimize the facade's scale. This could be a material module change, a change in facade plane of at least 6", use of an architectural ornament, recessed glazing, vertical banding, and/or groupings of windows. Avoid repetitive scaling elements that are monotonous and oppressive. For example, grids of repeated windows are discouraged. Facades on primary pedestrian streets shall be divided into three horizontal segments: a base, middle and top. When required setbacks do not differentiate these segments, architectural elements shall be used such as horizontal elements on the ground floor. 
(d)  Building continuity. All sides of a structure shall be continuous in design. No side shall be unimproved. Therefore, all architectural details, such as roof lines and parapets shall continue around all sides of a structure. Similarly, false architectural features and structures are discouraged unless they are integral to the building's design. On facades enclosing non-active uses, architectural treatment shall be provided. 
(e)  Planar breaks. For building frontages greater than 150 feet, no façade shall exceed 60 percent of the building frontage without providing a planar break or multiple planar breaks a minimum of three feet in depth. The cumulative horizontal length of all planar breaks shall be greater than or equal to 20 percent of the building frontage. 
(f)  Shadows. Changes in plane around windows and entrances are encouraged to highlight building openings and access points for pedestrians. 
(g)  Awnings or canopies. Awnings or canopies shall be used to enhance building facades and storefronts with color and dimension and to provide shade for browsing and cafe seating. Different awnings shall be used for various storefronts to avoid a homogeneous appearance including free or fixed valances, open or closed sided, and open-sided with a valance drop. Creative uses of materials are encouraged. Awnings shall be generally consistent in height and depth to create consistent shade coverage. 
(h)  Entrances. Entries shall be articulated with different building materials, changes in building massing, or changes in the roof line that break the facade's regulated surface. This creates a facade hierarchy that articulates entrances. Similarly, entrances shall be setback from the primary building frontage at least six inches. Enhanced lighting and signage shall also be incorporated in entry designs. Corner entrances shall be designed to address street corners. This may include additional building mass, distinctive architectural elements, different building materials, changes in building planes, and changes in building shape. Large banks of glass doors at main entrances shall be used to interrupt blank expanses of building facades. 
(i)  Storefronts. Storefront windows shall be at least ten feet high and shall be similar in proportion to display windows. Window sills shall be close to the building base, proportional to pedestrians. The storefront frame shall be setback from the building facade between six inches and 12 inches to create depth and shadow. Entrances shall be recessed in storefronts or highlighted within the storefront. Window displays shall be simple and focused and shall not obstruct views into the store. 
(j)  Shutters. Impact glass in lieu of hurricane shutters is recommended for ground floor uses. If shutters are used, they should be concealed from public view. Opaque security shutters will not be permitted in this district. Rather, transparent, security grills shall be utilized to maintain transparency when stores are closed. This will enable window shopping and activate the street during non-business hours. 
(k)  Architectural lighting. Light buildings at night to create shadows and depth and highlight important architectural elements and building materials such as colored glass and perforated metal. Whenever possible, light second story windows to imply human presence and counter the appearance of desertion. Use decorative lighting to illuminate signs and up lighting to illuminate landscaping. Glare shields should be used to reduce light spillover into pedestrian and vehicular areas. Use sconces and other architectural lighting to illuminate building entrances with warm light. 
(l)  Storefront lighting. Illuminate signs, entrances, window displays and interiors at varying levels of brightness. 
(m)  Building tops. Residential towers shall have distinctive building tops or finials whenever possible. 
(n)  Parking garage roof. Uncovered parking garage roofs shall be concealed with creative, colored surfaces and landscaping. 
(o)  Roof tops. All roof top equipment must be concealed. Green roofs or roof tops planted with heat tolerant, low maintenance cultivated plant life are strongly encouraged. Recreational uses are encouraged on roof tops. 
(p)  Surface parking lots. Surface parking lots shall be paved with brick pavers or stamped asphalt. Use of plain asphalt is limited to parking areas that are not readily visible from street view. Vehicular approaches should be paved with stamped asphalt or concrete, brick pavers or similar material in a color different from gray or black. 
(q)  Integration of signage, lighting and artwork. Signs, graphics and lighting for the building should be conceived as an integral part of the architectural design of the building. 
(r)  Screening of mechanical units and service areas. All mechanical units shall be screened from public view, preferably with cohesive design elements such as roof forms that complement with overall design. When roof decks with mechanical units are visible from adjacent developments, such roof decks should be screened and painted to match the finish of the roof material. Service areas shall be substantially screened from view from the street. Chain link or wood fences and/or gates are prohibited. Commercial loading areas, recycling areas, and trash and garbage containers shall be located away from residential units. 
(s)  Underground utilities. All new and existing utilities including, but not limited to utilities required for electric power, distribution, telephone, communication, street lighting and television service shall be installed underground, including existing utilities on the rights-of-way adjacent to the development.

(Ord. No. 99-118, § 1(32-38(d)), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 98-1575. - Implementation concepts. 
    The concepts of the district shall be as follows: 
(1)  Make pedestrians a high priority. Enhance the open network of smaller blocks and provide increased access through new sidewalks, paseos and public alleys. Provide a tree canopy planted along sidewalks or medians to create shade from the sun and more attractive streets or sidewalks. 
(2)  Slow down vehicular traffic. Reduce lanes or lane widths, expand the median and add on-street parking and trees as traffic calming devices. Use swale areas facing streets and sidewalks for trees and shrubs and encourage property owners to enhance landscaping. Provide parking in the rear areas, hidden from the front view. Reconstruct curbs with smaller radii at intersections. Encourage property owners to provide cross access between their parking lots and that of their neighbors. 
(3)  Improve pedestrian corridors. Improve commercial facades to increase pedestrian comfort and safety through enhanced lighting and landscaping. Improve the network of secondary pedestrian corridors in order to extend existing patterns of pedestrian travel. Create a sense of enclosure and urban character through street facade. 
(4)  Aggregate open space for squares, plazas, passive parks and other public open spaces. Promote activity and natural surveillance by providing plazas and squares, open to the public and level with the grade of the sidewalk. Create a legible network of open spaces by waiving minimum open space requirements on specific lots or parcels in exchange for a credit to develop larger open public spaces. 
(5)  Extend transit, at a variety of scales and modes of travel. Implement a circulator system, such as a local bus system, to be used for local service and to connect to the regional system. Increase transit ridership to facilitate growth and mobility without unmanageable traffic congestion. 
(6)  Attack visual blight. Promote infill development along the edges of blocks to define street space. Inventory vacant or underutilized lots and provide incentives for development. Utilize code enforcement procedures to compel compliance from property owners who have neglected the appearance of their property. Enforce building codes to ensure applicable minimum standards for older buildings. 
(7)  Provide for water retention areas to improve drainage and flooding protection in low-lying areas. Promote the procurement of vacant or underutilized land that may be reservoirs for additional storage and storm water retention within the district. Provide for a hydric park network to reduce flooding and restore the community's connection to water resources. 
(8)  Promote civic uses. Encourage public access and participation by providing cultural performances, gatherings and displays for education and enlightenment.

All thoroughfares shall terminate at other thoroughfares, forming a network. Dead-end systems of culs-de-sac, collectors and arterials are discouraged. Exception: Thoroughfares that terminate at facilities which, for purposes of their size or the nature of their use (such as major institutions) require limited public access or heightened security. 
(3)  Thoroughfare classification and compatible frontage regulations. The type of uses permitted within the district correspond and are dependent on the thoroughfare classification that such permitted uses front. A thoroughfare classification map shall illustrate the general location of access roads, boulevards, commercial connector roads, industrial service connector roads, edge roads, entrance roads and park drives as follows: 

a.  Access road means a local right-of-way that connects a boulevard with the interior of the district, having a minimum width of 70 feet. Access roads provide frontage for industrial buildings, slip lanes intended to accommodate noncommercial vehicles and pedestrian access to the industrial buildings. Entrance roads are considered to be the longer of either the first 400 feet of an access road or the portion of the frontage of an access road that is dedicated to the office or commercial uses as shown on the master plan for the development. The intersection of two access roads is considered a center. 
b.  Boulevard means a right-of-way of at least four lanes that is geared for non-local traffic and includes a landscaped median. A boulevard should be buffered by wide sidewalks of no less than eight feet and a green landscaped area of no less than five feet directly adjacent to the street. When land elevation or the proximity to limited access rights-of-way makes this impracticable, sidewalks may be located outside the right-of-way but remain open to public use. A boulevard provides frontage primarily for commercial buildings, regional parks, civic buildings and town centers. 
c.  Commercial connector road means a limited distance, two-lane slow movement right-of-way connecting locations within a commercial area. Commercial connector roads abutting commercial uses provide frontage for offices and compatible commercial buildings in the form of arcades, shop fronts and slip lanes. 
d.  Industrial service connector road means a limited distance, two-lane slow movement right-of-way connecting locations within an industrial area. Industrial service connector roads abutting industrial and service uses provide frontage for open parking lots, truck courts, unmasked parking decks, drive-throughs and hermetic building fronts, when these are necessary. 
e.  Edge road means a right-of-way that delineates jurisdictions. An edge road provides frontage for open parking lots, unmasked parking decks, drive-throughs and hermetic building fronts, when these are necessary. A boulevard shall not be considered as an edge road. 
f.  Entrance road means the longer of either the first 400 feet of an access road or the portion of the frontage of an access road that is dedicated to office or commercial uses as shown on the master plan for the development. The entrance road provides frontage for offices and compatible commercial buildings in the form of arcades, shop fronts and slip lanes. Trucks with more than two axles are prohibited from parking on entrance roads. 
g.  Park drive means a thoroughfare along the boundary between an urbanized and a natural condition, usually along a public park or waterfront. One side of a drive has the urban character of a street with sidewalks and buildings, while the other has the qualities of a parkway with naturalistic planting and rural detailing. The park drive shall be designed, operated and regulated in such a manner that commercial vehicles (trucks with more than two axles) shall be discouraged and prohibited from circulating on park drives. Edge roads shall not be considered as park drives. 
(e)  Permitted uses. In BDH business development district, the permitted uses for land, buildings and other improvements are subject to the general conditions requiring that all storage of materials and products and all operations of work of every character are carried on entirely within the enclosing walls and under the roof of a building and/or enclosed by a decorative masonry wall when the work is of a nature to be performed outside of a building.

Sec. 98-1986. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Disability means a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of an individual's major life activities, impairs an individual's ability to live independently, having a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. People with disabilities do not include individuals who are currently using alcohol, illegal drugs, or using legal drugs to which they are addicted or individuals who constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of others. 
    Residential Care and Treatment Facilities or facility means any institution, building, residence, private home, or other place, whether operated for profit or not, which undertakes through its ownership or management to provide, for a period exceeding 24 hours, housing, food service, and personal services to three or more people not related to the owner or administrator by blood or marriage, who require such services, and may provide supportive services, or provide extended congregate care, nursing services or mental health services, or other services, which are licensed by the State to include the Florida Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the Florida Department of Elderly Affairs, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration, or the Florida Department of Children and Families, excluding a community residential home, as provided by state law, F.S. § 419.001, namely, a dwelling unit licensed to serve residents who are clients of these agencies, which provides a living environment for seven to 14 unrelated residents who operate as the functional equivalent of a family, including such supervision and care by supportive staff as may be necessary to meet the physical, emotional, and social needs of the residents, licensed by the aforementioned agencies, as well as, the clients of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. A community residential home that otherwise meets the definition under F.S. § 419.001, but is not licensed as provided therein, that serves the functional equivalent of a biological family of unrelated individuals with disabilities, and makes sober living arrangements also known as recovery residences, shall be certified by the state's designated credentialing entity established under F.S. § 397.487, and shall be regulated as a residential care and treatment facility as provided in §§ 98-1987 through 98-1988, and §§ 98-1990 through 98-1992. The foregoing do not include any other group living arrangement for unrelated individuals who are not disabled nor residential facilities for prison pre-parolees or sex offenders. If the required license or credentialing has been denied to a proposed facility, it is ineligible for a permit. A facility offering the services described in this definition for fewer than three people is within the meaning of this definition if it formally or informally advertises or solicits the public for residents or referrals and holds itself out to the public as an establishment which regularly provides such services.

If the additional fees are not received by the city within 30 days of the date of notice, the city shall notify such applicant and the applicant shall pay an additional late fee at the rate of 12 percent per annum of the amount unpaid or underpaid. If the city does not receive said fee in total within 60 days of the date of notice, the city shall notify the applicant in writing and may revoke any approval. 
(c)  Applicants regulated by this subdivision may request a pre-application conference with the city. Such request shall be submitted with a non-refundable fee to reimburse the city for the cost and fees incurred by the conference. 
(d)  Unless otherwise authorized by state or federal law, no person shall construct, install or maintain a wireless communications facility within the city without the city's approval pursuant to this subdivision. 
(e)  With the exception of collocation applications, the planning and zoning division shall review the new telecommunications tower, and antenna applications for consistency with the city's land development regulations including this subdivision, and compatibility of the proposed telecommunications tower and antenna with the surrounding neighborhood. For applications that are not subject to the city council's approval pursuant to this chapter, the planning and zoning division shall issue a written decision either granting or denying an application. The planning and zoning division shall not grant an application for a proposed wireless communications facility that will interfere with any essential services, or is otherwise not in compliance with this subdivision. In the event the planning and zoning division denies an application, the planning and zoning division shall set forth the reasons for denial in writing. 
(f)  Notification of completeness. The planning and zoning division shall notify the applicant within 20 business days after the date the application is submitted as to whether the application is, for administrative purposes only, properly completed and has been properly submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth above. However, such determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. Such notification shall indicate with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, could make the application properly completed. 
(g)  After the planning and zoning division has determined that the application is ready to be processed, with the exception of a collocation application, the application shall be forwarded to the appropriate staff, and the design review committee pursuant to the requirements of this division, in accordance with applicable law. 
(h)  In the event that the planning and zoning division determines that a proposed wireless communications facility is not in compliance with this chapter, the planning and zoning official shall deny the application and shall set forth the reasons for denial in writing, in accordance with applicable law. Provided, however, that in the event a proposed wireless communications facility is not in compliance with one or more requirements of this division, the planning and zoning official may approve the application if the planning and zoning official determines that the requested modification to the development standards of this division will not be detrimental to the city. 
(h)  It is the intent of this section to establish a procedure for compliance with the "written decision" and "substantial evidence" requirements of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). 
(i)  The city shall grant or deny each properly completed application for a collocation based on the application's compliance with this chapter, City Code and any other applicable regulations, and within the normal timeframe for a similar building permit review but in no case later than 45 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe may be extended when the application involves lease negotiations for collocation on city-owned property. 
(j)  The city shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other wireless communications facility based on the application's compliance with this section and any other applicable law, including but not limited to the City Code and within the normal timeframe for a similar type of review, but in no case later than 90 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe may be extended depending on lease negotiations for wireless communications facilities on city-owned property. 
(k)  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the city. If the city does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the city's regulations within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the city's regulations, the city shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, would make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the city shall notify the applicant, in writing, within the normal timeframes of review, but in no case longer than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. Deficiencies in document type or content not specified by the city do not make the application incomplete. Notwithstanding this sub-subparagraph, if a specified deficiency is not properly cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of deficiencies, the city may continue to request the information until such time as the specified deficiency is cured. However, if applicant does not cure the application deficiencies within 20 business days after receiving the notice of deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn or closed unless an extension due to reasonable circumstances of the time to cure is requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the 20-day period and such extension is granted by the planning and zoning division. 
(l)  The timeframes specified in this section may be extended, only to the extent that the application has not been granted or denied, because the city's procedures generally applicable to all other similar types of applications require action by the city council and/or planning and zoning division and/or design review committee, and such action has not taken place within the specified timeframes. Under such circumstances, the city council, planning and zoning division, or design review committee, as applicable, shall either grant or deny the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or, otherwise, the application shall be deemed automatically to be approved; accordingly, the planning and zoning division may by letter to the applicant extend the timeframe for a decision until the next available scheduled meeting date of the city council and/or planning and zoning division as to whether to grant or deny an application for a permit taken pursuant to this division. 
(m)  The city may request, but not require, a waiver of the timeframes by the applicant, except that, with respect to a specific application, the city may require a waiver in the case of a declared local, state, or federal emergency that directly affects the administration of all permitting activities of the city. 
(n)  The city may enter into an entry and testing agreement with the wireless communications facility owner, applicant and/or operator to determine the viability and feasibility of the site for placement of wireless telecommunications towers and antennas, in a form approved by the city attorney, without approval of the city council. 
(o)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city and an applicant may voluntarily agree to waive the timeframes set forth above. 
(p)  Appeal. If an application is denied by the planning and zoning division for noncompliance with the requirements of this subdivision then the applicant may appeal this decision to the city council in accordance with the timeframes and procedures specified herein. Any decision appealed from the city council may be appealed in accordance with applicable law. 
(q)  If an application is denied by the planning and zoning official for noncompliance with the requirements of this subdivision then the applicant may appeal this decision to the city council within 30 days after receiving the written decision. The city council, after a public hearing, shall make the final decision by resolution. 
(r)  If a permit is denied, or conditions imposed, then the city council shall consider the action taken upon review of the following factors: 
(1)  The technical and practical necessity for the installation of the telecommunications tower or wireless communications facility. 
(2)  Alternative measures of modifications that could be made to preserve the character of the neighborhood and to prevent aesthetic blight if installation were permitted. 
(s)  If an application is denied by the planning and zoning division for reasons other than non-compliance with this subdivision, excluding the Florida Building Code, then the applicant may appeal the decision directly to the city council, which shall, by resolution, make the final decision within 45 days of the denial. 
(t)  If the city council ultimately denies the application, the city council's resolution ordering the denial shall incorporate the application, the minutes of public meetings, along with written findings to the city staff, the planning and zoning division, and/or the city council explaining the basis for the denial. 
(u)  Modification of development standards. If an applicant seeks a modification to the wireless communications facility development standards provided in this subdivision, the applicant shall provide the nature of the specific relief sought and the engineering justification to demonstrate that, without such relief, applicability of the regulations would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of reliable and feasible wireless services. 
(v)  Nonconforming towers. A nonconforming telecommunications tower may remain on the site where it was originally approved provided that it is able to accommodate the minimum number of different users established by the collocation requirements required in this subdivision. Such nonconforming towers may be reconstructed to accommodate collocations provided that the degree of nonconformity with regard to location and setback, is not increased by the reconstruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a nonconforming tower is reconstructed to accommodate collocations, the location of the replacement tower may be placed up to ten feet from the existing nonconforming tower location within the boundaries of the same parent tract, subject to administrative approval by the planning and zoning division, and such relocation shall not be deemed to constitute an increase to an existing nonconformity with regard to location, setback and minimum distance separation requirements between towers. 
(Ord. No. 2017-036, § 3, 6-27-2017) 
Sec. 98-2363. - Collocation. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city to encourage collocation of antennas on existing structures, pre-existing towers and nonconforming towers. Except as provided herein, all towers shall have the capacity to permit multiple users. At a minimum, all towers shall be able to accommodate two collocations. 
(b)  To encourage such collocation, the building department may approve an application submitted to collocate antennas on an existing structure or a pre-existing tower consistent with this subdivision. The specific collocation applications indicated in the subsections below shall be subject to approval or denial by the building department. All other applications shall be subject to approval or denial by the planning and zoning division and/or city council. 
(c)  Any antenna and related equipment to service the antenna that is being collocated on an aboveground existing structure or pre-existing tower is not subject to other land development regulations of this chapter if the following criteria are met: 
(1)  The existing structure already contains an established antenna and related equipment and collocation of an antenna increases the height of the structure by more than ten percent or more than ten feet, whichever is greater; 
(2)  An existing tower, including a nonconforming tower, may be structurally modified in order to permit collocation or may be replaced through no more than administrative review and building permit review, if the overall height of the tower is not increased and, if a replacement, the replacement tower is a monopole tower or, if the existing tower is a camouflaged tower, the replacement tower is a like-camouflaged tower. This subparagraph shall not preclude a public hearing for any appeal of the decision on the application. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the exemption provided for in this section, construction of the antenna and related equipment is subject to review by the planning and zoning division and any other city department or agency for compliance with the city's design standards; life safety codes, including, but not limited to, building codes; and conditions or requirements in any existing permits, agreements, or approvals. Moreover, this section shall not relieve the permit holder for or owner of the existing structure or property of compliance with any applicable condition or requirement of a permit, agreement, or land development regulation, including, but not limited to, any aesthetic requirements, or law. 
(d)  Collocation applications requiring only building permit approval. 
(1)  Collocations on towers, including nonconforming towers, are subject to only building permit review, which may include a review for compliance with this subdivision, if they meet the following requirements: 
(i)  The collocation does not increase the height more than ten percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; 
(ii)  The collocation does not increase the ground space area, commonly known as the compound, approved in the site plan for equipment facilities and ancillary facilities, except as allowed under this subdivision; and 
(iii)  The collocation consists of antennas, equipment facilities, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with all applicable regulations, restrictions, or conditions, if any, applied to the initial antennas placed on the tower and to its accompanying equipment facilities and ancillary facilities and, if applicable, applied to the tower supporting the antennas. Such regulations may include the design and aesthetic requirements, but not procedural requirements, other than those authorized by this section, of the applicable land development regulations in effect at the time the initial antennas placement was approved. 
(2)  Such collocations are not subject to any design or placement requirements of land development regulations in effect at the time of the collocation that are more restrictive than those in effect at the time of the initial antennas placement approval, to any other portion of the land development regulations, or to public hearing review. Such collocation applications shall be decided by the planning and zoning division. 
(e)  Other collocation applications requiring only building permit approval. 
(f)  Except for a historic building, structure, site, object, or district, the following tower collocation applications on all other existing structures shall also be subject to no more than a building permit approval if they meet the following requirements: 
(1)  The collocation does not increase the height; 
(2)  The collocation does not increase the ground space area, otherwise known as the compound, if any, approved in the site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities; 
(3)  The collocation consists of antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with any applicable structural or aesthetic design requirements and any requirements for location on the structure, but not prohibitions or restrictions on the placement of additional collocations on the existing structure or procedural requirements, other than those authorized by this section at the time of the collocation application; and 
(4)  The collocation consists of antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with all applicable restrictions or conditions, if any, that do not conflict with this section and were applied to the initial antennas placed on the structure and to its accompanying equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities and, if applicable, applied to the structure supporting the antennas. 
(g)  If only a portion of the collocation does not meet the requirements of any of the above subsections, such as an increase above the permitted height, or a proposal to expand the ground space approved in the site plan for the equipment enclosure, where all other portions of the collocation meet the requirements of this subsection, that portion of the collocation only may be reviewed by the planning and zoning division. A collocation proposal under this subsection that increases the ground space area, otherwise known as the compound, approved in the original site plan for equipment facilities and ancillary facilities by 400 or more square feet or 50 percent or more of the original compound size, whichever is greater, shall require approval of a building permit. 
(h)  Any replacement of or modification to a wireless communications facility, except a tower, that results in a wireless communications facility not readily discernibly different in size, type, and appearance when viewed from ground level from surrounding properties, and the replacement or modification of equipment that is not visible from surrounding properties, all as reasonably determined by the city, shall require building permit approval. 
(i)  The owner of the pre-existing tower on which the proposed antennas are to be collocated shall remain responsible for compliance with any applicable condition or requirement of a permit or agreement, or any applicable condition or requirement of other provisions of these land development regulations to which the pre-existing tower must comply, including any aesthetic requirements, provided the condition or requirement is not inconsistent with this section.

Sec. 98-2462. - Review of application for development order. 
    The department shall review each application for a development order and shall determine whether the application requests approval of an initial or final development order or would have no impact or would have impacts on levels of service that fall below thresholds for public facilities and services prescribed in the land development code. 
(Code 1960, § 32-205(b); Ord. No. 94-109, § 2, 11-22-1994) 
Sec. 98-2463. - Initial development orders. 
(a)  The department shall evaluate each application for an initial development order on the basis of the concurrency review criteria contained in this article. The department shall determine whether or not a proposed development would result in a reduction in levels of service for public facilities and services below adopted levels of service and shall issue a concurrency proof to the applicant. 
(b)  If the concurrency proof indicates that the proposed development would not result in a reduction in adopted levels of service, such proof shall be furnished to the person, board or agency responsible for the issuance of the initial development order, and the development order may be issued. If the concurrency proof indicates that the requested development order cannot be issued because the proposed development would result in a reduction in adopted levels of service, the applicant may modify the application, submit an enforceable development agreement or the development order may be issued subject to appropriate conditions. Such modifications, agreements or conditions shall ensure that the necessary public facilities and services shall be available concurrent with the impacts of development. The concurrency proof shall specify the modifications, agreements or conditions which shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of an initial development order or final development order, or both. The concurrency proof shall be furnished to the applicant and to the person, board or agency responsible for the issuance of the development order and shall be made a part of the development order. Alternatively, the applicant may seek relief from this article by invoking the administrative remedies set forth in this article.

Sec. 98-2464. - Final development orders. 
(a)  With the exception of final development orders for which applications have been timely filed and capacities have been reserved, or certificates of use and occupancy as described in this article, the department shall evaluate each application for final development order on the basis of the concurrency review criteria contained in this article. The department shall determine whether or not the proposed development would result in a reduction in levels of service for public facilities and services below adopted levels of service and shall issue a concurrency proof to the applicant. If the concurrency proof indicates that the issuance of the proposed final development order would not result in a reduction in levels of service for public facilities and services below adopted levels of service, the concurrency proof shall be furnished to the person, board or agency responsible for the issuance of the final development order, and the final development order may be issued. 
(b)  If the concurrency proof indicates that the requested final development order cannot be issued because the proposed development would result in a reduction in adopted levels of service, the applicant may modify the application, submit an enforceable development agreement, or the final development order may be issued subject to appropriate conditions. Such modifications, agreements or conditions shall ensure that the necessary public facilities and services shall be available concurrent with the impacts of development. The concurrency proof issued in conjunction with a final development order application shall specify any modifications, agreements, or conditions which shall be satisfied prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of use and occupancy or both. The concurrency proof issued in conjunction with a final development order application shall be furnished to the applicant and to the person, board or agency responsible for the issuance of the final development order. 
Except where applicants have obtained a vested rights determination or the final development order application has been deemed exempt from the requirement of concurrency compliance statement, all applications for final development orders must obtain written confirmation that all required levels of service for public facilities and services have been satisfied. Required modifications and/or conditions noted in previously issued concurrency proofs must be satisfied prior to the issuance of a final development order. 
(c)  Certificates of use and occupancy may be issued without the requirement for further concurrency review where the applicant for the certificate of use and occupancy holds a valid, unexpired building permit for the identical use of the subject structure or site or pertinent portion thereof, provided such building permit is not subject to an enforceable development agreement or other conditions requiring the applicant to provide or contract for the construction of necessary public services and facilities or other appropriate service impact mitigation measures. Where the building permit is subject to such enforceable development agreement or appropriate conditions, no certificate of use and occupancy shall be issued until the department determines that all agreements and conditions have been satisfied.

DIVISION 4. - PROPORTIONATE FAIR SHARE MITIGATION FOR TRANSPORTATION 

Sec. 98-2501. - Applicability. 
    The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments within the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on one or more transportation facilities according to the concurrency management program, including transportation facilities maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the general requirements. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2502. - General requirements. 
(a)  An applicant whose project meets the applicability threshold may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(1)  The proposed development is consistent with the city comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; and 
(2)  The five-year schedule of capital improvements provided in the city capital improvements element (CIE) includes one or more transportation improvements that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city concurrency management program. The provisions of section (b) below may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the capital improvements element. 
(b)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment or segments, through the proportionate fair-share program, by the developer contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will create additional capacity on the deficient segment or segments sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicant's proposed development even if the improvement project for the deficient segment or segments is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE where: 
(1)  The city council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate share agreement and corresponding future changes to the five-year CIE; and 
(2)  The city council approves a proportionate fair-share agreement, by resolution, directing the administration to file a city-initiated amendment adding the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE, no later than the next regularly scheduled update or revision of the CIE. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council, and determined to be financially feasible, consistent with the city comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this division. 
(c)  Any improvement project proposed to meet a developer's fair-share obligation must meet city design standards for locally maintained roadways, and the state design standards for the state highway system. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2503. - Application process. 
(a)  Upon the notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the general requirements provided herein. 
(b)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall attend a pre-application meeting with the streets department and the planning division to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(c)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the planning division that includes an application fee, as established by resolution or administrative order, and the following: 
(1)  Name, address, and phone number of owner, developer and agent; 
(2)  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
(3)  Legal description and survey of property; 
(4)  Project description, including type, intensity, and amount of development; 
(5)  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
(6)  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method; 
(7)  Copy of concurrency application; and 
(8)  Location map depicting the site and affected road network. 
(d)  Within ten business days, the streets department and planning division shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program, then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. 
(e)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of FDOT. If a SIS facility is proposed for proportionate share mitigation, the applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(f)  Once an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the applicant with city assistance and delivered to the streets department and planning division for review, including a copy to FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on SIS facilities, no later than 60 days from the date at which the application was determined to be sufficient and no fewer than 14 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(g)  The office of the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the date, time, and location of city council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final action. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the city, by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2504. - Determination of proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(16)(c). 
(b)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ based on the form of mitigation as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180 (16)(c). 
(c)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The amount of the proportionate-share contribution shall be calculated based upon the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during the peak hour from the complete build-out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service. This methodology is expressed by the following formula: 
Proportionate Fair Share = + [[(Development Trips;sub \sub;) ° (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] X Cost;sub \sub;] 
(Note: In the context of the formula, the term "cumulative" does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development.) 
Where: 
+ = Sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fair-share mitigation for a project. 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i"; 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs, including design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs, directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur. 
(d)  For purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. 
(e)  If the city accepts an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on streets department cost estimate approved by the director of streets, or other method approved by the mayor. 
(f)  If the city accepts a right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant, based on a city-approved appraisal, is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to the purchase of acquisitions of any real estate intended to be used for proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2505. - Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(a)  Where mitigation is occurring on county roads, proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the county's impact fee ordinance. 
(b)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced according to the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due pursuant to the county's impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the county pursuant to the requirements of the county impact fee ordinance. 
(c)  Major projects not included within the county's impact fee ordinance or created herein that can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible, at the county's discretion, for impact fee credits. 
(d)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the county's impact fee ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2506. - Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(a)  The city has the authority by resolution to enter into a proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(b)  Upon executing a proportionate fair-share agreement, in a form acceptable by the city, and satisfying other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development order within 90 days of receiving concurrency approval by the city, the project's concurrency vesting shall expire, and the applicant shall be required to re-apply. 
(c)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final plat or building permit whichever occurs first. If the payment is submitted more than six months from the date of execution of the proportionate fair-share agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment. Once a proportionate share payment for a project is made and other impact fees for the project are paid, no refunds shall be given unless otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
(d)  All developer improvements authorized under the fair-share program must be completed as established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
(e)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(f)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(g)  Applicants should submit a letter to withdraw from a proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city are nonrefundable. 
(h)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2507. - Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(a)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the city's discretion, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(b)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the proportionate fair share revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that same corridor or sector where the alternative improvement will mitigate the impacts of the development project on the congested roadway or roadways for which the original proportionate fair share contribution was made. 
(Ord. No. 2007-36, § 2, 4-10-2007) 
Sec. 98-2508. - Proportionate fair-share program for TCMAs. 
    Within transportation concurrency management areas (TCMAs) designated by the city, the city hereby establishes a proportionate fair-share assessment, based on the expected costs and transportation benefits of all the programmed improvements in the area, and based on the expected trip generation of the proposed development.

(Code 1960, § 32-222; Ord. No. 92-145, § 2(2), 12-8-1992) 
Sec. 98-2524. - Scope and legislative intent. 
(a)  All residential development is deemed to create an impact and, therefore, an increased demand for public facilities, including public open space, park, and recreation facilities. As such, the cost of new public facilities should be borne by new users to the extent new use requires new facilities as formulated in the city's report on level of service standards for parks, recreation and open space (exhibit A of Ordinance No. 92-145, which is on file in the city clerk's office). Therefore, any application for a building permit within the city enabling the construction of residential dwelling units on or after December 8, 1992, shall be subject to the imposition of park, recreation and open space impact fees in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(b)  All fee payments shall be made prior to the issuance of a residential building permit, and no building permit shall be issued by the city unless and until the applicant has satisfied the provisions of this article. 
(c)  The public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that a minimum of 1.41 acres for each 1,000 persons residing within the city be devoted to local parks, as amended from time to time in the comprehensive plan. 
(d)  Each park site shall be physically suited for the use intended. 
(e)  Notwithstanding a feepayer's compliance with this article, other state, county and city development regulations may limit the issuance of building or use permits for development activity. 
(Code 1960, § 32-224; Ord. No. 92-145, § 2(4), 12-8-1992) 
Sec. 98-2525. - Park impact fee. 
(a)  The city park, recreation and open space impact fee shall be based upon the following formula: estimated cost per acre divided by 1,000, times average dwelling occupancy size, times level of service, added to 100 times average occupancy rate: 
Formula: 
A = LOS B = Estimated cost per acre C = Average dwelling occupancy size D = Park fees-Purchases E = Park fees-Improvements F = Total fee  
F = D + E 
Where: 
D = ( (;frac 1000;) × C) × A E = (100 × C)  
(b)  The components of this formula may be subject to annual formula review conducted prior to the end of each calendar year. 
(c)  This park, recreation, and open space impact fee reflects the impact of residential development on both the need for park and open space and the need for improvements to local park property. Any person requesting a building permit for residential development shall pay the impact fee reflected in the impact fee formula. 
(Code 1960, § 32-225; Ord. No. 92-145, § 2(5), 12-8-1992) 
Sec. 98-2526. - Land dedication in lieu of monetary fees. 
(a)  At the time of tentative platting, the feepayer may request a park and open space determination from the recreation and community services department for the purpose of determining whether land dedication in lieu of the park, recreation and open space fee is acceptable to the department. 
(b)  The recreation and community services department shall determine whether land dedication and monetary fees, or a combination thereof, would be in the best interest of the city. The department's determination may be in accordance with the following criteria and for the purpose of maintaining the permanent level of service: 
(1)  Addressing future needs by maintaining not less than the minimum permanent level of service for local public parks as population growth occurs. 
(2)  Completion of public projects started. 
(3)  Initiation of new public projects identified in the capital improvements element. 
(c)  If the feepayer elects to dedicate land, and if the department determines such dedication to be in the city's best interest, the amount of land to be dedicated shall be based upon the projected population for the area being developed and the level of service standard per 1,000 persons. 
(d)  Land dedications shall be conveyed by plat and deed. All dedications shall be platted with the residential plat adjacent to the designated park site or by alternate arrangement specified in a recordable agreement, as determined by the recreation and community services department. The determination by the department to accept dedications shall be based on the city's present needs and availability of other park sites within the immediate vicinity of the development.

ARTICLE IX. - FIRE RESCUE IMPACT FEE 

Sec. 98-2561. - Short title; applicability; purpose. 
(a)  This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Fire Rescue Impact Fee Ordinance". 
(b)  This article shall apply to the development of property for residential, commercial and industrial uses located within the boundaries of the city. 
(c)  The existence of a fire rescue and fire protection services benefits to proximate residential, commercial and industrial development. These benefits include life safety and property protection to all properties and residents within a corresponding service area. 
(d)  The purpose of this article is to preserve not only the adequate level of fire rescue service facilities and equipment but also such facilities and equipment necessary to address the impact and serve the demands of new development within the city, including the recently annexed area. The impact fee requires that future growth contributes its fair and proportionate share to the cost of additions and improvements to the city's fire rescue and fire protection services in amounts reasonably anticipated to offset the impact and demands generated by such growth. This cost does not include operational and maintenance costs. Nothing in this article shall prohibit or restrict funding of fire rescue facilities and equipment from other revenue sources to enhance fire rescue services. 
(Ord. No. 2004-53, § 1, 9-16-2004) 
Sec. 98-2562. - Scope and legislative intent. 
(a)  All development is deemed to create an impact and therefore, new development generates an increased demand for fire rescue services. As such, new users shall assume the cost of new facilities and equipment to the extent that new users require new facilities and equipment. Therefore, any development from October 1, 2004 shall be subject to the assessment of the fire rescue impact fee in the manner and amount set forth in this article. 
(b)  All fee payments or other contributions shall be made prior to the issuance of a building permit, and no building permit shall be issued by the city unless and until the applicant has satisfied the provisions of this article. 
(c)  For a building permit that expires or is revoked after October 1, 2004, the feepayer shall be entitled to a refund of a previously paid impact fee; provided, however, that if the applicant reapplies for building permit on the same property, the fire rescue impact fee that is currently in effect shall be paid. 
(d)  Notwithstanding a feepayer's compliance with this article, other state, county and city development regulations may limit the issuance of building or use permits for development activities. 
(Ord. No. 2004-53, § 1, 9-16-2004) 
Sec. 98-2563. - Fire rescue impact fee. 
(a)  The fire rescue impact fee shall be based upon the following formula: 
Formula: 
A = Capital costs of the fire rescue service 
B = Percentage of capital cost required for land/use occupancy type 
C = Capital cost for land use/occupancy type 
D = Total units of land use/occupancy type in city (or cost per square foot for nonresidential land use) 
E = Capital cost for each unit 
F = Feepayer's number of units 
G = Fire rescue impact fee 
Where: 
A × B = C 
C/D = E 
E × F = G 
(b)  For additions to an existing residential occupancy, the fire rescue impact feet shall be computed as follows: 
A = Existing square footage 
B = Fire impact fee (by occupancy type) 
C = Fire rescue impact fee for each square foot 
D = Feepayers' number of additional square feet 
E = Fire rescue impact fee 
A/B = C 
C × D = E 
(c)  The fire chief shall annually adjust the fire impact fee schedule, which is maintained in the office of the city clerk, by indexing the schedule to inflation as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers for the United States, published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. The initial indexing or recalculation shall occur during the 2006-2007 fiscal year using the difference in the CPI figures for calendar years 2005 and 2006. 
(d)  Unless otherwise directed by the city council, by ordinance, adjustments to the fire impact fee pursuant to this section shall become effective on the first day of October during each calendar year. 
(e)  If the CPI is changed by the United States Department of Labor so that the base year is different, the index shall be converted according to the conversion factor published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
(f)  If the CPI is discontinued or revised, such other government index or computation that replaces or changes the CPI shall be used in order to obtain substantially the same result as would be obtained if the CPI had not bee discontinued or revised. 
(g)  The components of this formula may be subject to annual formula review conducted prior to the end of each calendar year. The chart, comprising of the land use/occupation type, percentage of capital costs, net capital costs, number of units or square feet of occupancy in the city and cost for each unit or cost for each square foot, will be on file with the city clerk. The chart comprising land use/occupation types identifies broad categories and to that extent, the fire chief, in computing the fee, shall determine the type of activity that is most similar to the listed type of use or occupation when such use or occupation is not identified in the chart. 
(h)  Any person requesting a building permit for residential, commercial or industrial development shall pay the impact fee reflected in the impact fee formula.

The department's determination may be according to the following criteria and for the purpose of maintaining adequate and sufficient service levels: 
(1)  Addressing future needs by maintaining adequate and sufficient service levels for fire rescue and fire protection services as population growth occurs. 
(2)  Completion of public projects started. 
(3)  Initiation of new public projects identified in the capital improvements element. 
(c)  If the feepayer elects to dedicate land, and if the department determines such dedication to be in the city's best interest, the amount of land dedicated shall be based on the projected population and business development in the area being developed and level of service standards. 
(d)  Land dedications shall be conveyed by plat and deed. All dedications shall be platted with the plat adjacent to the designated site or by alternate arrangement specified in a recordable agreement, as determined by the city. The determination by the city to accept dedications shall be based on the city's present needs and availability of other fire rescue facilities within the immediate vicinity of the development.

REGULATION NO. 1 - LAND DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- The land development regulations are supplements to the Code of Ordinances of the City of Hialeah. The land development regulation is not the sole source of information. The Code of Ordinances should also be consulted prior to taking development action. 

Sec. 1-1. - Purpose. 
    This section provides an overview of the land development procedures, rights and remedies, including amendments to the land development code and time schedules for evaluation and appraisal reports and intergovernmental coordination elements to the comprehensive plan. 
Sec. 1-2. - Procedures for applications for development orders. 
(a)  Applications for changes of comprehensive plan amendments. Changes of land use classifications are to be considered comprehensive plan amendments. The procedures for applications for comprehensive plan amendments, including future land use map amendments, are governed by Hialeah Code sections 98-37, 98-102 and 98-103 and division 6 of article II of chapter 98, as amended, Hialeah Charter § 4.07(a)(3), as amended, Hialeah Code article VII of chapter 98, as amended, F.S. §§ 163.3184 and 163.3187, as amended, and administrative rules promulgated pursuant to F.S. ch. 163, part II, and policies and procedures established by the planning and development department. 
(b)  Applications for changes of zoning, including supplements, changes, modifications, variances or repeal of regulations, restrictions and boundaries established by zoning ordinances for hearing before the planning and zoning board. The procedures for applications for changes of zoning, including amendments, supplements, changes, modifications, variances or repeal of regulations, restrictions and boundaries established by zoning ordinances for hearing before the planning and zoning board are governed by Hialeah Charter § 4.07(a)(3), as amended, Hialeah Code sections 98-37, 98-102 and 98-103 and division 6 of article II of chapter 98, as amended, F.S. ch. 163, part II, as amended, as it pertains to development orders, and policies and procedures established by the planning and development department. 
(c)  Applications for setback adjustments or variances and nonuse variances for presentment before the planning and zoning board as final decision maker. The procedures for applications for setback adjustments or variances and nonuse variances for final decision before the planning and zoning board are governed by Hialeah Charter § 4.07(a)(3), as amended, Hialeah Code sections 98-36, 98-37, 98-102 and 98-103 and division 6 of article II of chapter 98, as amended, and policies and procedures established by the planning and development department. 
(1)  Exception for percentage adjustments to front, corner and street side setbacks on properties for urban infill and development, excluding Hialeah Heights. The city shall allow a percentage adjustment to front, corner and street side setbacks on properties for urban infill and development based on a sliding scale of maximum setback adjustment percentages calculated on a total point value of urban design elements as provided in section 98-275 hereof, without the necessity of applying for a setback adjustment. 
(d)  Applications for administrative variances before the administrative variance committee. The procedures for applications for administrative variances are governed by Hialeah Code division 8 of article II of chapter 98, as amended, and policies and procedures established by the planning and development department. An administrative variance involves variances which have no relation to change of use of property and which relate only to matters concerning setback requirements, landscaping requirements, sign regulations, floor area requirements, yard requirements, lot coverage, height, width and length limitations for structures or buildings and spacing requirements between principal and accessory buildings. 
(e)  Applications for reversion to prior zoning classifications. 
(1)  Discontinuance of use granted by variance. The procedure for property to revert back to its underlying zoning in effect at the time the variance was granted when such approved use has been discontinued is by rescission and repeal of the ordinance granting the variance. The procedure may be initiated by application of the property owner or the city. 
(2)  Changes in use of property granted by SUP (special use permit). The procedure for property to revert back to its zoning classification without the benefit of the SUP when an approved SUP (special use permit) use has been changed is by rescission and repeal of the ordinance granting the SUP. The procedure may be initiated by application of the property owner or the city. The SUP (special use permit), a use variance, replaced the former zoning category SU-P (special use-property) that allowed uses that would not otherwise be permitted within the underlying zoning classification. Reversion of existing properties with SU-P (special use-property) zoning classification to its prior zoning, based on misuse or nonuse, shall be accomplished only by rescission and repeal of the ordinance granting the SU-P. 
(3)  Departure, change in use or violations of grant of CUP (conditional use permit). CUP (conditional use permit) is a grant for a specific permitted use within a zoning district that has an extraordinary impact with the surrounding neighborhood or area, rot wit: cemeteries, community correctional centers or prisons, public garages, funeral homes, hospitals, houses of worship, motels, hotels, child day care facilities that are not state-licensed or state-registered family day care homes on property zoned R-1, private schools, charter schools, vocational and technical schools, and post-secondary education facilities, colleges and universities. The procedure for property to revert back to its zoning classification without the benefit of the CUP when there is a departure, change in use or violation of the approved CUP is by repeal and rescission of the ordinance granting the CUP. The procedure may be initiated by application of the city, property owner or objector. 
(f)  Expedited permitting for affordable housing projects. 
(1)  Appointment of an affordable housing expediter. The city provides a form, with a priority number assigned, to identify and certify the affordable housing status of an application for a development order. In order to certify the application as involving affordable housing, a representative from grants administration will initially review the project to determine whether it meets affordability criteria and contact the planning and development department. The same representative will act as an affordable housing expediter charged with the responsibility of ensuring a consistent, expedited review of the project. In addition, the same staff person will act as an advocate and access person for developers of affordable housing projects if they encounter unexplained delays or problems. 
(2)  Permitting process. 
a.  Preapplication site inspection for renovation. Planning and development department shall conduct preapplication site inspections in connection with applications for building permits for renovations, including interior changes, roof and facade alterations but excluding renovations involving structural repairs. Planning and development department may waive requirements of a survey for applications for the issuance of a building permit regarding renovations involving affordable housing development. 
b.  Preapplication meeting with respect to multifamily development. The affordable housing expediter and plans examiner shall meet with the developer prior to submitting an application for a building permit on multifamily projects in order to discuss any anticipated problems or delays and in order to assist in coordinating a schedule of inspections, if the need should arise. 
c.  Growth management advisory committee review. On applications for development orders that are reviewed by the growth management advisory committee (GMAC), written comments should be solicited and received from grants administration regarding the impact on affordable housing with respect to the application under review and consideration. 
(3)  Affordable housing incentives enacted in connection with or after the adoption of the City of Hialeah Affordable Housing Incentive Plan on October 10, 1995. 
a.  Impact fee exemptions. The city provides an exemption from payment of interim proprietary and general services fee for affordable housing as defined by the City of Hialeah Affordable Housing Incentive Plan that is owned by the City of Hialeah or funded, in whole or in part, by the City of Hialeah through local, state or federal assistance programs. See Hialeah Code section 98-2565(4). The city provides an exemption from payment of park, recreation and open space impact fees for affordable housing properties developed and owned by the City of Hialeah. See Hialeah Code section 98-2530(5). 
b.  Expansion of expedited administrative variance procedure. The administrative variance committee has the authority to review limited nonuse variances which have no relation to change of use of property and which relating [relate] only to matters concerning setback requirements, landscaping requirements, sign regulations, floor area requirements, yard requirements, lot coverage, height, width and length limitations for structures of [or] buildings and spacing requirements between principal and accessory buildings. The review of the administrative variance committee is limited to variance requests on already developed individual lots except that the committee may review requested variances of undeveloped individual lots intended for development of affordable housing. See Hialeah Code section 98-258. 
c.  Revision of parking requirements for central business district development. Required off-street parking areas are generally required to be located on the same lot, parcel or premises as the use to be served. However, in commercial-residential (C-R) zoning districts, the maximum distance limitation for off-street parking was extended to a 600-foot radius of the main entrance of the mixed commercial-residential use served. In central business district (CBD) zoning districts, the maximum distance limitation was extended to a 900-foot radius of the main entrance of the mixed commercial-residential use served. 
d.  Expansion of parking requirements in areas outside central business district development. If the use to be served is an apartment building, the parking area may be on a lot or parcel of land that is of the same land use classification as the property which it serves and that the parking area is located within a 300-foot radius from the main entrance to such use as an apartment building to be served. 
e.  Expanded criteria for granting adjustments, variances, special use permits and conditional use permits. Zoning variances, adjustments, special use permits and conditional use permits are judged by the same criteria that includes a determination based on whether the development is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning code and the Hialeah Land Development Code and consistent with the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan; and whether the development will provide substantial justice, not be contrary to the public interest and not adversely affect the use and development of neighboring properties. 
(g)  Change in ownership of multifamily residences, mixed-use properties, commercial and industrial properties to condominium or cooperative ownership. Rental multifamily apartment buildings that are converted to cooperative or condominium ownership and industrial or commercial properties that are converted to cooperative or condominium ownership of individual warehouse bays or retail spaces are subject to a limited site plan review of parking and landscaping. Site plan review as provided in this paragraph and seller's agreement to notify each buyer of a condominium or cooperative unit of the county recertification of buildings that are in existence for over 40 years and every ten years thereafter is also required prior to issuance by the city of zoning compliance pursuant to F.S. § 718.616(4). The recertification notification shall include a copy of Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida subsection 8-11(f), which requires a property owner to provide the building official with an architect or professional engineer's report certifying that the building or structure is structurally and electrically safe or has been made structurally and electrically safe for the specified use for continued occupancy and which further requires city approval upon inspection and payment of a fee.

Sec. 1-3. - Decisions and conduct of hearings. 
(a)  Decisions on comprehensive plan amendments, including future land use map amendments. At a public hearing before the planning and zoning board upon application for a change in land use classification or other comprehensive plan amendments, the planning and zoning board makes its recommendation to the city council. At a hearing designated for decisions on comprehensive plan amendments, the city council may approve a resolution for adoption of a comprehensive plan amendment. The resolution is an expression of intent to consider a request for future adoption. The resolution is transmitted to the Florida Department of Community Affairs for review. The resolution must be approved by a five-sevenths vote of the city council for transmittal to the Florida Department of Community Affairs. If the Florida Department of Community Affairs issues its objections, recommendations and comments (ORC) report without objections, then the plan amendment may be adopted by ordinance. Adoption of a plan amendment by the city council shall be by affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the city council as provided in F.S. § 163.3184(15)(a), as amended. The effective date of the plan amendment shall be the date a final order is issued by the department of community affairs or an administration commission finding the amendment to be in compliance with F.S. § 163.3184, whichever occurs earlier. No development orders, development permits or land uses dependent on the amendment may be issued or commenced before it has become effective. If the department of community affairs issues a notice of intent to find the plan not in compliance, proceedings may be conducted before the division of administrative hearings of the department of management services, upon petition for formal hearing by the city or an affected person, in accordance with F.S. § 163.3184(10), as amended. If a final order of noncompliance is issued by the administration commission, this amendment may nevertheless be made effective by adoption of a resolution affirming its effective status, subject to sanctions, pursuant to F.S. § 163.3184(10). 
(b)  Zoning decisions of the city council recommended by the planning and zoning board. At a public hearing, the planning and zoning board makes its recommendation on an application or petition. The planning and zoning board may recommend to deny an application or to approve an application. The planning and zoning board may recommend approval of an application with modifications only if the applicant amends his/her application or proffers an amended request to the board. The city council may override by a five-sevenths vote or adopt the recommendation of the planning and zoning board by ordinance. All applications for more than one variance shall be treated as a single request and accordingly, the planning and zoning board must vote only on the request as a whole, and not separately on the individual items that comprise the request. Bifurcation of a rezoning request from accompanied variance requests may be permitted at the discretion of the planning and zoning board. 
(c)  Final decisions of the planning and zoning board. At a public hearing, the planning and zoning board shall make its decision on an application on matters that require a final decision. The planning and zoning board shall make final decisions on petitions requesting setback and other adjustments that do not seek rezoning, a use variance, a special use permit or a conditional use permit, and on petitions requesting variances of sign regulations concerning the number, location, type and features of a sign. Also, the planning and zoning board shall make final decisions on appeal of decisions of the administrative variance committee. The decision shall be in writing and signed by the presiding member of the planning and zoning board. The date of the decision shall be the date of the public hearing wherein the decision was announced. 
(d)  Decisions of the administrative variance committee. The administrative variance committee may approve or approve with conditions applications or requests for administrative variances which permit variations up to but not exceeding 20 percent of the ordinance requirements for minimum yards and setbacks, minimum landscaping, maximum size and number of signs, location, type and features of signs, minimum and maximum floor area, maximum lot coverage, maximum height, length and width of buildings, minimum spacing requirements between principal and accessory buildings and sign regulations. 
(e)  Conduct of hearings. The planning and zoning board and city council may establish its own policies and procedures for the governance of its hearing, including but not limited to the conduct of hearings, presentation of evidence and examination of witnesses.

Sec. 1-4. - Appellate remedies generally. 
(a)  Decisions of the city council. The zoning decisions of the city council are considered final administrative orders, which are appealable, by certiorari, to the circuit court in accordance with the Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure. Renewed requests on applications for change of zoning and zoning variances and use permits that require adoption of an ordinance may be prohibited for one year by procedure instituted by the planning and zoning board. There are no other time limitations imposed by the Hialeah Code or Charter which would prevent a renewed request on matters presentable to the planning and zoning board as final decision maker or to the city council via the planning and zoning board. 
(b)  Final decisions of the planning and zoning board. The final decisions of the planning and zoning board shall be reviewed by the city council. The city council is authorized to affirm, affirm with conditions or override the decisions by resolution. The city council will conduct a de novo review of the decisions. The property owner, objectors and interested parties may offer or submit additional evidence and testimony at the hearing before the city council. The review will be heard at the earliest regularly scheduled city council meeting after the decision of the planning and zoning board is signed; provided that the appeal of the decision is advertised in a newspaper according to state law at least ten days prior to hearing. 
(c)  Decisions of the administrative variance committee. A property owner requesting an administrative variance shall have a right to proceed de novo before the planning and zoning board if any of the following events occur: 
(1)  If the property owner objects to the committee's decision to approve the requests with conditions; 
(2)  If a property owner in the area, affected by the decision, objects to the decision of the committee in writing and the objection is received by the city within 14 calendar days of the date of publication of the decision of the committee; and 
(3)  If less than a majority of a quorum of the committee members vote affirmatively for the request to be approved or approved with conditions.

Note- Formerly, § 1-9. 
Sec. 1-11. - Vesting rights and takings. 
(a)  Definitions. Vested rights may operate to prevent the city from revoking certain previously approved development orders if the landowner has relied upon the approval to his detriment. A taking of private property without just compensation ("taking") can occur when government action deprives the landowner of all use of his property, First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378 (1987) and Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886 (1992), or deprives the landowner of all beneficial use of the land. 
(b)  Procedure. No applicant claiming that a particular development order constitutes or would constitute a taking or an abrogation of vested right may pursue such a claim in court or before a quasi-judicial body unless he has first exhausted the administrative remedies provided herein. Claims of a taking or abrogation of vested rights are limited solely to extreme circumstances rising to the level of a potential denial of rights under the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Florida or as now provided in the Private Property Rights Protection Act. The procedures provided herein or demonstrating such a taking or abrogation of vested rights are not intended to be utilized routinely or frivolously, but only in the extreme circumstances described above. 
(1)  To initiate a claim, the applicant must file a "notice of invoking administrative remedies" with the planning division, on a form prescribed by the planning division, accompanied by an administrative fee in an amount of $250.00 or such other amount approved by the city council. The notice of invoking administrative remedies must be filed within 15 days of the denial of a development permit or not later than 45 days before the first hearing on a development order or action which requires the approval of the city council or city agency or department if the claimant is challenging some intended or future action. 
(2)  The applicant shall file a complete sworn statement within 90 days of the filing of the notice of invoking administrative remedy. The applicant shall submit a sworn statement setting forth the facts upon which the claim is based and shall attach copies of any contracts, letters, appraisals, reports or other documents upon which the claim is based. The sworn statement shall provide a list of the names and addresses of any witnesses that the applicant shall present in support of the claim and a summary of the testimony of each witness. The signature of the claimant or the attorney on the sworn statement shall constitute a certification that the person signing has read the document and to the best of his knowledge it is supported by good grounds and that it has not been presented solely for delay. The claimant and the attorney of the claimant shall have a continuing obligation throughout the proceedings to correct any statement or representation found to have been incorrect when made or which becomes incorrect by virtue of changed circumstances. If a claim of taking or abrogation of vested rights is: (1) based upon facts that the claimant or the attorney knew or should have known was not true; or (2) frivolous or filed solely for the purposes of delay, the city council shall make a finding and may pursue any remedy or impose any penalty provided by law or ordinance. 
(3)  The grounds for the notice and sworn statement must allege that the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan, as applied to a particular developmental order or action, constitutes or would constitute a temporary or permanent taking of private property or an abrogation of vested rights. For example, an applicant may allege that the denial of a permit based on inconsistency with the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan constituted a taking or abrogation of vested rights. The applicant must allege, as a prerequisite for standing, the following: (1) Reliance upon some action or omission of the city; and (2) detrimental reliance, i.e., the applicant invested funds or incurred binding obligations that would represent real injury if such development is denied. 
(4)  The planning division and the law department shall make separate recommendations on each claim or individual matter. The planning division shall review the claim to ensure that all required information and documentation has been provided. The planning division and the law department shall be guided by applicable principles of land use planning and law respectively. 
(5)  The matter will be scheduled for a public hearing before the growth management advisory committee where evidence will be heard and upon which the growth management advisory committee shall make a recommendation to the city council. The city council shall decide the matter presented. 
(Ord. No. 96-2, § 2, 1-23-1996; Ord. No. 97-17, § 2, 3-25-1997; Ord. No. 98-30, § 2, 4-14-1998; Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Note- Formerly, § 1-10. 
Sec. 1-12. - Nonconformities. 
(a)  Determination of nonconforming use. A lawful use of property that existed at the time of adoption of the final land development code is considered nonconforming if its continued use varies from the requirements of the land development code, as amended. A nonconforming use may continue on property subject to the provisions contained in this division. A nonconforming use shall not be based on causal, temporary or illegal uses of property. 
(b)  Limitations. 
(1)  A nonconforming use may not be enlarged, intensified, increased or extended to occupy a greater area in any direction nor shall such use be replaced by another use not specifically permitted in the zoning district concerned. Land that has a nonconforming use may neither be subdivided nor improved with a structure or building. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the limitations in subsection (b)(1) of this section, a variance may be granted for an enlarged, intensified, increased or an extended nonconforming use if it is determined that such use is more compatible with the surrounding properties and area than at the time when the use became nonconforming and if it does not adversely affect or impact the public interest. Compliance with the current requirements of the city fire prevention code and building codes is mandatory for such approved uses. 
(c)  Discontinuance. Nonconforming uses that are discontinued for more than 90 consecutive days or for 180 days within a one-year period shall terminate and no longer exist. 
(d)  Termination. Nonconforming uses may be terminated by a five-sevenths vote of the city council by ordinance if the continuation of the nonconforming use adversely affects the health, safety and welfare of the city; provided, however, due consideration is given to the rights of the property owner in providing a reasonable time for compliance with current regulations. 
(e)  Undeveloped or vacant subdivided land. 
(1)  Individual platted lots. Except as provided in subsection 98-348(a), if an individual lot has been legally subdivided pursuant to a plat recorded in the public records of Miami-Dade County, prior to the adoption of the land development code as amended, the individual lot, if lawful at the time of recording, becomes a nonconforming use if it varies from the requirements of the land development code, as amended; provided, however, that the lot owner does not own a lot abutting the individual lot. If the lot owner owns an abutting lot, the requirements of the land development code, as amended, must be satisfied. 
(2)  Two or more platted lots or parts thereof. Except as provided in subsection 98-348(a), a nonconforming use will not be allowed if two or more contiguous lots or portions of lots with continuous frontage are owned by the same person. The property owner must comply with the current requirements of the land development code, as amended. 
(f)  Developed property. 
(1)  Restoration or replacement permitted. If a building or structure contains a nonconforming use, removal or destruction of the building or structure terminates the nonconformity. Destruction shall mean damage to an extent that repair or renovation would amount to 50 percent or more, or 25 percent or more if damage is structural, of the value of the building or structure as determined by the building official according to the standards set forth in the South Florida Building Code, as amended. Where damage is less than 50 percent, or less than 25 percent if damage is structural, of the value determination, the building or structure may be restored or renovated to the same or lesser size in the same location; provided, however, that restoration commences within six months of date of damage and is diligently completed. 
(2)  Individual platted lots. For individual platted lots, the same regulations apply as provided for undeveloped or vacant subdivided land in subsection (e) of this section. 
(3)  Two or more platted lots or parts thereof. For two or more platted lots or parts thereof, the same regulations apply as provided for undeveloped or vacant subdivided land in subsection (e) of this section. 
(g)  Eminent domain. In circumstances where a property owner receives proceeds as a result of a final judgment in eminent domain proceedings initiated by a governmental entity or government agency or receives monetary funds as part of a settlement in lieu of, in anticipation of, or as a result of eminent domain proceedings to cure a nonconformity created by the taking or acquisition of property by the governmental entity or agency, the property owner must use the proceeds or funds to cure the nonconformity on the affected property within 18 months of receipt of such proceeds or funds. The property owner shall obtain a building permit within six months of receipt of proceeds or funds to commence construction in effecting the cure. The duty to cure shall extend to successors in interest if the property owner sells, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of the property prior to curing the property.

The declaration of restrictive covenants shall be signed by the developer of the residential development district and architectural control committee prior to the sale of the first residential unit and shall be incorporated by reference in the deed of the property conveyed by the developer to the first buyer. 
(b)  Architectural control committee. The architectural control committee shall consist of a minimum of three members and a maximum of five members, who have been assigned the continuing rights and duties by the developer to oversee and undertake the application and enforcement of the declaration of restrictive covenants and to review and consider any and all proposed changes to the structure, appearance or specifications of any residential building or lot that do not modify the approved site plan and do not vary from the Hialeah Heights Master Plan for Residential Development. The number and appointment of members to the architectural control committee and the terms of service shall be provided in the declaration of restrictive covenants; provided that the majority of members are residential unit owners within the affected residential development after the developer sells a majority of the residential units within the residential development. In addition to enforcement powers of the architectural control committee, the city may also enforce the provisions of the declaration of restrictive covenants by citation, notice of violation, injunction or other legal or administrative remedies. 
(c)  Redevelopment of landfill sites. On properties under a closure plan approved by county department of environmental resources (DERM), on properties that have finalized such closure plan or on properties that will be required to enter into a closure plan with DERM prior to redevelopment, the city will allow the elevation and slope of the land that was formerly used as a landfill for which buildings and structures shall be constructed to be limited as follows: 
(1)  The elevation of land less than or equal to 20 acres shall not exceed 14 feet from the crown of the road that is either adjacent to, abutting, or in the closest proximity to, the land. The measurement includes the additional layer of clean fill that is required to be placed on top of property that was used as a landfill. If there is a corner lot or property where a property abuts two rights-of-way where the crown of the road of each right-of-way is measured at different heights, the crown of the abutting right-of-way that is higher shall apply for the entire property. 
(2)  The elevation of land that is greater than 20 acres developed as one site or as phased development titled under the same property owner or affiliated company shall conform to the following topography: 
Maximum percentage of total gross acreage Maximum

The measurement includes the additional layer of clean fill that is required to be placed on top of the property that was used as a landfill. If there is a corner lot or property where a property abuts two rights-of-way where the crown of the road of each right-of-way is measured at different heights, the crown of the abutting right-of-way that is higher shall apply for the entire property. 
(3)  Slope. The slope of the property shall be no greater than the angle of 10 degrees. 
For land greater than 20 acres developed as one site or as phased development titled under the same property owner or affiliated company, the slope of the land may exceed an angle greater than ten degrees but no greater than 20 degrees only to allow adjustments for stormwater retention and landscape berms and swales; provided, however, that the slope of all vehicular rights-of-way and pedestrian pathways not exceed the angle of ten degrees at all locations. In addition, ancillary retaining walls may be constructed to accommodate the difference between maximum elevations if such walls include stairs or a ramp and otherwise are integrated into the surrounding buildings or structures. 
(4)  Properties fronting the western edge of NW 97 Avenue (West 36 Avenue). The first 1,320 feet adjacent to the property line shall have the lowest land elevation of the property. If the first 1,320 feet adjacent to the property line contains an upwards slope, the slope should be gradual and subtle; without creating hills and valleys, except to provide a landscape berm or enclosure of a production water well that may be located at or near the right-of-way. 
(5)  The land elevations on the property shall be designed to promote pedestrian access and the connectivity of the street network. 
(6)  Prior to the issuance of the building permit, the applicant shall obtain city approval of a land elevation plan than complies with the requirements of this section.

Editor's note- The land development regulations are supplements to the Code of Ordinances of the City of Hialeah. The land development regulation is not the sole source of information. The Code of Ordinances should also be consulted prior to taking development action. 

Sec. 2-1. - Purpose. 
    This section provides regulations for the use of land and water for land use categories included in the future land use element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan. This section provides an overview of the general requirements for the use of land and water within municipal boundaries and a correlation between land use classifications and zoning districts or areas. The regulations intend to permit the use and development of property in accordance with the goals, objectives and policies expressed in the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan and to ensure the compatibility of adjacent land uses and the provision of open space. 
Sec. 2-2. - Relationship between land use classifications and zoning districts or designations. 
    The future land use element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan established land use classifications or categories of property within the City of Hialeah. Land use classifications of individual properties are identified in the future land use map included in the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan. Chapter 98 (zoning code) of the Hialeah Code identifies the zoning districts or designations within the City of Hialeah. The land use classifications provide perimeters [parameters] and guidelines for present and future land development. The zoning districts provide parameters for the extent of permitted uses for designated properties. If there is a conflict between the uses permitted within an existing zoning district and the use of land permitted within a land use classification with respect to a particular property, then the use permitted within the designated land use classification prevails. 
    Zoning districts or designations generally correspond to certain land use classifications or categories. The following table describes the relationship between zoning districts or designations and land use classifications or categories:

Cross reference- Water and sewers, ch. 94. 

Sec. 3-1. - Purpose 
    The purpose of this section is to provide regulation for protection of potable water wellfields in satisfaction of the requirements of F.S. § 163.3202 and F.A.C. 9J-24.004(c). This section supplements the Miami-Dade County Code § 24-12.1 et seq., also known as the Potable Water Supply Well Protection Ordinance, which is adopted by reference. The regulations provide control of land uses and activities within identified cones of influence for potable water wells and wellfields, in order to protect the potable water supply. 
    The Biscayne Aquifer is the source of the City of Hialeah's supply of potable water. To protect the quality of the Biscayne Aquifer, Miami-Dade County has instituted the wellfields protection program that restricts the types of uses permitted within wellfields located in urban areas. The parameters of the program are set forth in Miami-Dade County Code § 24-12.1 et seq. The provisions of the ordinance establish standards for land uses within cones of influence protecting public potable water supply wells from contamination in incorporated and unincorporated areas throughout Miami-Dade County. 
(Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Sec. 3-2. - Definitions. 
(a)  Cone of influence means an area around one or more major water wells the boundary of which is determined by the governmental agency having specific legislative authority to make such a determination based on groundwater travel or drawdown depth. 
(b)  Potable water means water that is suitable for drinking. 
Sec. 3-3. - Water shortage regulations. 
(a)  Definitions. In construing this section, where the context will permit and no definition is provided in this section, the definitions provided in F.S. ch. 373 and in the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as may be amended from time to time, shall apply. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    District is the South Florida Water Management District. 
    Water resource means any and all water on or beneath the surface of the ground, including natural or artificial water courses, lakes, ponds or diffused surface water and water percolating, standing or flowing beneath the surface of the ground. 
    Water shortage condition means that situation when sufficient water is not available to meet present or anticipated needs of any person using the water resource or when conditions occur that require temporary reduction in total water usage within a particular area to protect the water resource from serious harm. A water shortage usually coincides with drought conditions. 
    Water shortage emergency means that situation when the powers that can be exercised under part II of chapter 40E-21, Florida Administrative Code, are insufficient to protect the public health, safety or welfare, or the health of animals, fish or aquatic life, or protect the public water resource from serious harm. 
(b)  Applicability. Water shortage regulations intend to protect the city water resources from the deleterious effects of overutilization during water shortages and assist the South Florida Water Management District in implementing its water shortage plan. These regulations apply to any person using the water resource within the geographic areas subject to a water shortage emergency or water shortage as determined by the district, whether from public or privately-owed water utility systems, private wells or private connections with surface water bodies. These regulations do not apply to a person using treated effluent or saltwater. 
(c)  Upon a declaration of a water shortage or water shortage emergency within all or any part of the city by the governing board or the executive director of the district, all water use restrictions or other measures adopted by the district applicable to the city shall be subject to enforcement action. The water shortage plan as promulgated in chapter 40E-21, F.A.C. shall then become effective. 
(Ord. No. 2002-29, § 2, 5-14-2002) 
Sec. 3-4. - Areas of concern. 
(a)  Aquifer recharge. The city shall control development that overlays recharge areas with impervious surfaces since impervious areas reduce percolation from rainfall and alter the level of the aquifer and its rate of recharge. 
(b)  Water contamination. The importance of maintaining the prime recharge capability of the surface area is underscored by the principles of gravity and the fact that significant groundwater contamination often occurs by pollutants carried by stormwater runoff. Accordingly, the city shall enforce to the extent permitted: 
(1)  Miami-Dade County regulations established for the protection of public potable water wells. 
(2)  Restrictions for the areas surrounding the Hialeah Wellfield also known as the John E. Preston Wellfield. 
(3)  Regulations enacted by the city for the protection of potable water. 
(4)  Chapter 94 of the Hialeah Code, as amended. 
(Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Sec. 3-5. - Regulations for the protection of potable water. 
(a)  Within the cone of influence identified in table 3-1, the planning division may only review uses that do not generate hazardous waste. Thus, the city may only approve uses permitted within the regulatory boundaries of cone of influence map (table 3-1); provided, however, that such uses are consistent with the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan and its future land use map. 
(b)  All permitted uses within the cone of influence located within municipal boundaries shall be connected to the sewer system of the City of Hialeah. 
(c)  Within the cone of influence, the city shall approve only developments that meet minimum requirements for percentage of pervious area. 
(d)  Uses within the area identified in table 3-1 as having a 210-day water travel time to a public well shall be restricted to uses that will not create water pollution. Uses such as gas stations, dry cleaning and photo processing shall be prohibited within the cone of influence unless permitted by Miami-Dade County when specific limitations are required. 
(e)  Deposit of hazardous waste in a landfill or illegal dump site, disposal of waste into storm or sanitary sewers, burial or injection of waste into water wells or other methods of waste disposal that threaten groundwater are prohibited. 
(f)  The measured impact or water requirements for any new development or redevelopment shall be provided in the concurrency proof. 
(g)  Before a development order is issued, the director of the water and sewers department shall sign the concurrency proof to ensure that water and sewer capacities are in compliance with pertinent regulation. 
(h)  For aquifer recharge, low density residential uses shall have a minimum of 30 percent of the lot area as pervious. Impervious surfaces shall have a minimum separation of two feet from the property lines; except impervious surfaces located on the front property line that are used for access, such as driveways or entrances, may be connected directly to the street and/or sidewalk. 
(i)  Prior to the issuance of a development order, the planning division shall review only developments designed to prevent direct discharge of stormwater into lakes or other bodies of water. 
(j)  For the protection of potable water wells, the city adopts the regulations of Miami-Dade County Code § 24-12.1 et seq., as amended.

Such billboards facing the Palmetto Expressway, State Road 112 and facing that portion of I-75 that extends in an east-west direction. The billboard to be replaced in an existing location or a new replacement location may include LED sign face or faces subject to the compliance with the provisions of this section and the reduction of sign faces on the existing or replaced sign through a ratio of two sign faces for each LED sign face for traditional billboards. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings described to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Automatic changing or digital billboard sign means a billboard that utilizes a mechanism to allow advertisements to rotate in succession. 
    Billboard means an off-site large outdoor structure that is predominately a sign in which the message or advertisement comprises an activity or business that is not operating or being conducted on the property in which the billboard is located. The words "billboard" and "sign" as used in this section are interchangeable since the regulations concern only billboards. 
    Embellishments mean a physical or structural extension to the billboard that enhances, emphasizes or directs attention to the sign message. 
    Grade means crown or highest elevation of the adjacent road. 
    Mobile billboard means a billboard that includes a sign, installed on or attached to a vehicle, or connected to a vehicle as a trailer, that is capable of transport. Mobile billboards cannot be parked in an open parking lot, parking space or open space, but must be garaged and not visible to the public, when the vehicle is not in transit. 
    Sign face means the sign surface where the advertisement is exhibited. 
    Roof-top sign means a billboard erected on top of a roof of a building. 
    Traditional billboard means a large outdoor structure, excluding a roof-top sign, which is predominately a sign where the advertisement does not rotate, but is stationary. 
(c)  Regulations supplemental to state law. The provisions of this section are supplemental to state law and shall be construed to complement and be reconciled with state law, where possible. To the extent that there is an irreconcilable conflict with applicable state sign law, rule or regulation, state law shall prevail. In any event, signs facing state roads shall comply with state sign law, rule and regulations in addition to compliance with the provisions set forth in this section and in relocation and reconstruction agreements pursuant to F.S. § 70.20. 
(d)  Location. The replacement sign permit as described in this section shall apply only to the relocation or replacement, repair or retrofit of existing permitted billboards facing the Palmetto Expressway, State Road 112 and facing that portion of I-75 that extends in an east-west direction that have a legal nonconforming status as of the effective date of this section; provided, however, in no event shall the replacement or relocation of a billboard result in an increase in the number of billboards within the city. The replacement of roof-top billboards is encouraged through relocation and the replacement of interior signs or signs facing residential neighborhoods are preferred. A replacement, repaired, retrofitted or relocated sign may include one or more LED sign faces contingent upon the reduction of sign faces on the existing or replaced sign in a ratio of two sign faces for each LED sign face for traditional billboards. A new monopole billboard that replaces a removed roof-top sign may include one LED sign face without a reduction of sign faces that existed on the existing or replaced sign.

Digital billboards shall not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.3-foot candles above ambient light, as measured using a foot candle meter at a pre-set distance. Pre-set distances to measure the foot candles impact vary with the expected viewing distances of each size sign. Measurement distance criteria shall be as follows: 
Face size Distance to be measured from: 12 feet × 25 feet 150 feet 14 feet × 48 feet 250 feet  
(5)  Duration. Any portion of the message to be displayed must have a minimum duration of eight seconds and must be a static display.

Any off-premises automatic changing sign must contain a default design that will in the event of a malfunction either hold the face of the display on the sign in any one position, turn the face of the display on the sign off or show "full black" on the face of the display on the sign. 
(6)  Landscaping and perimeter fencing. Where feasible, metal picket or black vinyl coated chain-link fencing are required. Landscaping that is approved through the replacement sign approval process shall be viable and maintained at all times except as further provided in a relocation and reconstruction agreement where mitigation may be considered for the conversion of an existing sign 
(j)  Replacement sign permit fee, permit application, review and neighborhood enhancement and park contribution. The owner or operator of a proposed replacement billboard, with the written consent of the property owner of the property where the sign is to be located, may apply for a replacement sign permit, in an application provided by the city, including all electrical, structural, elevation and color depictions, measurements and other drawings or plans required by the city, for review and approval by the city planning and building divisions. The plans shall include an updated survey and a site plan including landscaping and parking space for vehicles for maintenance purposes and show the location and the setback of all buildings and structures on the property and within a 100-foot radius of the proposed sign location. The application shall provide a signed copy of the lease or easement agreement with the property owner and sign owner or operator or a memorandum of such agreement, if applicable. Within 15 days after the sign owner or operator receives all final governmental approvals, authorizations and permits for the billboard replacement sign, the sign owner or operator shall completely remove the sign and supporting structures to be replaced, prior to the completion of construction of the new sign. Complete removal includes, but is not limited to, the faces, structure, electrical connections and all other appurtenances related to the sign to be replaced. Work pursuant to a replacement sign permit shall require that the site be prepared, cleared or repaired. The replacement sign permit fee shall be $25,000.00, which shall be paid at the time the application is accepted by the city or as otherwise provided in the relocation and reconstruction agreement. An annual neighborhood enhancement and park contribution of $15,000.00 for each year that the replacement sign is located on the property is an example of adequate consideration for the reconstruction and relocation agreement. 
(k)  Denial of permit. The city reserves the right to reject a replacement sign permit for failure to comply with the requirements of this section. If the city denies a permit, the city shall provide written reasons for its denial. 
(l)  Relocation and reconstruction agreements. The sign owner and operator shall sign a relocation and reconstruction agreement pursuant to section F.S. § 70.20, prior to the issuance of the replacement sign permit in form and substance acceptable to the city and the sign owner and operator. 
(m)  Credit for annual recertification fee payment. For the first ten years from the year in which the new replacement sign is approved, the sign owner is excused from payment of the annual recertification fee for the legally nonconforming replacement billboards. 
(Ord. No. 2012-45, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 7-19. - Sign maintenance. 
(a)  Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in a safe, presentable and sound structural condition, which includes the replacement of defective parts, repainting, cleaning and other acts required for the maintenance of signs and surrounding areas. 
(b)  Abandoned signs. An abandoned sign shall have all sign copy replaced with a blank face. 
(c)  Ineffective signs. Any sign, except authorized temporary signs, located on property that becomes vacant and unoccupied for a period of 90 days or more, or any sign which pertains to a purpose that no longer applies, shall be deemed ineffective and as such, shall be considered an abandoned sign. 
(d)  Dangerous or defective signs. No person shall permit or maintain any sign that is in a dangerous or defective condition on premises in the city. Any such sign shall be removed or repaired by the owner of the sign or by the owner of the premises. 
(e)  Unlawful signs. No person shall install or maintain, or causes to install or maintain, on any premises in the city any sign that is prohibited or any sign or any sign that does not comply with the provisions of this regulation or any sign that has not received a valid permit unless exempted therefrom.

Note- Formerly, § 7-18. 
Sec. 7-20. - Removal of improper signs. 
(a)  Removal. The director shall cause the removal of any sign in violation of this chapter in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 22 of the Code of Ordinances governing code enforcement. 
(b)  Emergency. Notwithstanding the above, the director may cause the immediate removal of any sign that presents an immediate danger to the health, safety or welfare of the community. The director may cause the sign to be made safe as an alternative to removal. In either event, city personnel may enter onto the premises, with or without the consent of the property owner, for emergency repair or removal. City personnel are not authorized to repair or remove signs on property without the consent of the property owner or agent in the absence of an emergency as defined in this paragraph. 
(c)  Removal costs. Costs incurred by the City of Hialeah for the removal or repair of a sign may be charged to the real property owner on whose property the sign is located and in the case of political signs, to the property owner and/or the political candidate or political sign sponsor. The city shall assess all costs, including, but not limited to, all administrative costs, postal expenses and newspaper publication costs associated with the demolition, removal or repair of such signs. Such charge shall constitute a lien on the affected property. The city clerk shall file such lien in the official records book in Miami-Dade County showing the nature of the lien, the amount thereof and the legal description of the property. Liens created hereunder shall be neither filed nor foreclosed on real property which is homestead under section 4, article X of the Florida Constitution.

Editor's note- The land development regulations are supplements to the Code of Ordinances of the City of Hialeah. The land development regulation is not the sole source of information. The Code of Ordinances should also be consulted prior to taking development action. 
Cross reference- Concurrency management system for zoning, § 98-2392 et seq. 
State Law reference- Concurrency management, F.S. § 163.3180. 

Sec. 8-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this section is to ensure that development activities within the city are concurrent with the required infrastructure in conformity with F.S. § 163.3180 and F.A.C. 9J-5.005. The Hialeah Concurrency Management Program provides assurance that development orders shall not be issued unless public facilities and services which meet or exceed the adopted level of service standards are available concurrent with the impacts of the development. Unless public facilities and services which meet or exceed such standards are available at the time the development permit is issued, development orders shall be specifically conditioned upon availability of the public facilities and services necessary to serve the proposed development within the meaning of F.A.C. 9J-24.004(h). Concurrency is a mechanism to measure the impact of proposed development on the following public services: (1) roads; (2) sanitary sewers; (3) solid waste; (4) drainage; (5) potable water; (6) parks and open space; and (7) mass transit. Accordingly, concurrency assesses the ability of the municipal infrastructure to support a proposed development. 
    This regulation is intended to supplement the Hialeah Concurrency Management System Manual which shall be incorporated herein by reference. The Hialeah Concurrency Management System Manual will comprise of two volumes: (1) Volume 1: Administrative Procedures; and (2) Volume 2: Methodology. The Hialeah Concurrency Management System Manual shall be completed upon final adoption of the amended traffic and circulation element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan. Due to changing circumstances, the manual may be supplemented or updated to reflect current conditions. 
(Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Sec. 8-2. - Components of a concurrency management system. 
    The City of Hialeah Concurrency Management System consists of four parts: (1) the enabling ordinance; (2) the administrative program; (3) the system analysis; and (4) the computer monitoring and update program. The enabling ordinance provides the legal basis for implementation of the program according to state law. The administrative program, as contained in the Concurrency Management System Manual, provides the administrative procedures for implementing the program. The system analysis consists of the evaluation procedures for evaluating the increases in capacity that would result from improvements to the city infrastructure. The computer monitoring and update program consists of a computerized mechanism for comparing the impacts of proposed development against the surplus, uncommitted capacity of public services and for providing periodic reports on the status of public services and for providing current data to Miami-Dade County that is required on approved development. 
(a)  Enabling ordinance. The ordinance, Hialeah Code article VII of chapter 98, as amended, provides the city administration with the authority and framework under which to implement the concurrency management system. The ordinance ensures that public facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development. No development order shall be issued which would result in a reduction in the levels of service (LOS) for public facilities and services below the levels of service adopted in the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Administrative program. The administrative program provides the administrative procedures for implementing the program. The planning division of the planning and development department, in cooperation with other departments, shall determine the available, unused capacity of the applicable services. The planning division shall further evaluate applications for development requiring concurrency determinations based on unused, uncommitted or surplus capacity that remains available without causing a violation of or jeopardizing the adopted level of service standard. Evaluation of the availability of surplus or remaining capacity for use must take into consideration commitments or reservations made or incurred by the city for previously approved development orders or pending applications for development orders. 
(c)  System analysis. All developments or improvements to property must be reviewed in conjunction with the provisions of the concurrency management program and the concurrency management system manual prior to the issuance of a development order. 
(d)  Computer monitoring and update program. The computer monitoring and update program consists of a computerized mechanism for comparing the impacts of proposed developments against the uncommitted, surplus capacity of public services, for providing a system for periodic reports on the status of public services and for providing current data to Miami-Dade County that is required on approved developments. 
(Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Sec. 8-3. - Types of concurrency review. 
    There are two types of concurrency review corresponding to the level of detail available for a development as follows: (1) concurrency information review that provides general information on the availability of public services; and (2) concurrency impact/compliance review that evaluates the adequacy of public services needed to support the project. 
(a)  Concurrency information statement. The concurrency information statement provides information on the availability of the aforementioned seven services. The statement is intended to provide policymakers, staff and the public with information relevant to a specific project location. This review is a prerequisite to any preliminary development application where the type and size (densities and intensities) of the development are not presently known or decided upon by the applicant. 
(b)  Concurrency impact statement or concurrency compliance statement. For any project in which the type and size of a project (densities and intensities) are known, an analysis will be performed to determine whether sufficient capacity remains to serve the project for each of the seven services. Pursuant to F.A.C. ch. 9J-5, the city is prohibited from approving any application for a development order which will result in a demand in excess of the available capacity of any of the seven services. This concurrency review is a prerequisite for issuance of a final development order. The review is completed upon issuance of a concurrency statement. 
Sec. 8-4. - Concurrency methodology. 
(a)  The planning division of the planning and development department, in cooperation with other departments and agencies, shall determine the available, unused capacity of the seven applicable services and evaluate concurrency applications based on the unused or "remaining capacity" of those services. The "remaining capacity" shall mean the unused, uncommitted or surplus capacity of a service that remains available without causing a violation of the level of service standard. Remaining capacity shall take into consideration committed improvements that are to be made to each service and consider commitments or reservations made by the city for previously approved development[s] order or pending applications for development orders. 
(b)  The methodology includes an identification of service areas or zones reflecting the characteristics of each service. For example, the service area served by a city master pump station constitutes a zone in relationship to the analysis of the sanitary sewer service and the ability of the master pump station to provide service to a proposed project will form the basis for a concurrency determination regarding sanitary sewer service. Zones are defined by the characteristics of the individual service and socioeconomic factors. Concurrency determinations, in some instances, rely on capacity calculations prepared by Miami-Dade County. In those instances, a letter of capacity from the responsible Miami-Dade County agency shall constitute a blanket determination of concurrency for that service sufficient for reliance by the City. 
(c)  The determination of concurrency shall be based on a consideration of the following criteria: 
(1) Sanitary sewers Capacity of the city master pump stations (2) Solid waste Capacity of landfills, incineration facilities, recycling facilities and other disposal facilities (3) Drainage Protection from flooding (4) Potable water Capacity of the potable water system (5) Parks and open space Number and size of each type of open space and park (6) Roads Capacity of each primary road, adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the comprehensive plan (7) Mass transit Not generally applicable. Frequency of bus trips and proximity to rail lines may be considered toward credit for specific projects only  
(d)  The planning division, in cooperation with other departments, shall incorporate into the analysis the planned and committed improvements to capacity, for each of the seven services. Such improvements shall include the following: 
(1)  Public facilities that are subject to an enforceable binding agreement. 
(2)  Public facilities that are funded and scheduled for implementation in the capital improvements element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan for construction in the first year (year one) of the city's adopted capital budget or similarly adopted budget of other governmental agencies. 
(3)  Traffic circulation and mass transit facilities or services, or both, that are scheduled in the capital improvements element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan for construction in or before the completion of the third year (year three) of the city's adopted budget or similarly adopted budget of other governmental agencies including the capital budget of Miami-Dade County or the state agency having operational responsibility for affected facilities; in all cases, such facilities must be committed for construction in or before year three. 
(e)  Other responsible departments and agencies will cooperate with the planning division in the evaluation of the remaining capacity of each public service and provide the planning division with information from which concurrency will be evaluated or with a blanket letter of capacity applicable to all potential development during the next calendar year. Concurrency reviews shall use the following agenda:

Sec. 8-5. - Proportionate fare share mitigation for transportation. 
(a)  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments within the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on one or more transportation facilities according to the concurrency management program, including transportation facilities maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations, pursuant to the general requirements. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs) using proportionate fair-share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency. 
(b)  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant whose project meets the applicability threshold may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the city comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; and 
b.  The five-year schedule of capital improvements provided in the city capital improvements element (CIE) includes one or more transportation improvements that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of the city concurrency management program. The provisions of section (b) below may apply if a project or projects needed to satisfy concurrency are not presently contained within the capital improvements element. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment or segments, through the proportionate fair-share program, by the developer contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will create additional capacity on the deficient segment or segments sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicant's proposed development even if the improvement project for the deficient segment or segments is not contained in the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE where: 
a.  The city council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate share agreement and corresponding future changes to the five-year CIE; and 
b.  The city council approves a proportionate fair-share agreement, by resolution, directing the administration to file a city-initiated amendment adding the improvement to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE, no later than the next regularly scheduled update or revision of the CIE. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council, and determined to be financially feasible, consistent with the city comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this division. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet a developer's fair-share obligation must meet city design standards for locally maintained roadways, and the state design standards for the state highway system. 
(c)  Application process. 
(1)  Upon the notification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency, an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program pursuant to the general requirements provided herein. 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall attend a pre-application meeting with the streets department and the planning division to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), then FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the planning division that includes an application fee, as established by resolution or administrative order, and the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner, developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of property; 
d.  Project description, including type, intensity, and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of requested proportionate fair-share mitigation method; 
g.  Copy of concurrency application; and 
h.  Location map depicting the site and affected road network. 
(4)  Within ten business days, the streets department and planning division shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient and complete. If an application is determined to be insufficient, incomplete, or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fair-share program, then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of submittal of the application. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrency of FDOT. If a SIS facility is proposed for proportionate share mitigation, the applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6)  Once an application is deemed sufficient, complete, and eligible, a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the applicant with city assistance and delivered to the streets department and planning division for review, including a copy to FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on SIS facilities, no later than 60 days from the date at which the application was determined to be sufficient and no fewer than 14 days prior to the city council meeting when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The office of the city clerk shall notify the applicant of the date, time, and location of city council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final action. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the city, by resolution. 
(d)  Determination of proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(16)(c). 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ based on the form of mitigation as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180 (16)(c). 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The amount of the proportionate-share contribution shall be calculated based upon the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during the peak hour from the complete build-out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service. This methodology is expressed by the following formula: 
Proportionate Fair Share = + [[(Development Trips;sub \sub;) ° (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] X Cost;sub \sub;] 
(Note: In the context of the formula, the term "cumulative" does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development.) 
Where: 
+ = Sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fair-share mitigation for a project. 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i"; 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs, including design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs, directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur. 
(4)  For purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual and/or anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur. 
(5)  If the city accepts an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be based on streets department cost estimate approved by the director of streets, or other method approved by the mayor. 
(6)  If the city accepts a right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant, based on a city-approved appraisal, is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. Prior to the purchase of acquisitions of any real estate intended to be used for proportionate fair-share, public or private partners should contact FDOT for essential information about compliance with federal law and regulations. 
(e)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Where mitigation is occurring on county roads, proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the county's impact fee ordinance. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced according to the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due pursuant to the county's impact fee ordinance. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the county pursuant to the requirements of the county impact fee ordinance. 
(3)  Major projects not included within the county's impact fee ordinance or created herein that can demonstrate a significant benefit to the impacted transportation system may be eligible, at the county's discretion, for impact fee credits. 
(4)  The proportionate fair-share obligation is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other location unless provided for within the county's impact fee ordinance. 
(f)  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  The city has the authority by resolution to enter into a proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(2)  Upon executing a proportionate fair-share agreement, in a form acceptable by the city, and satisfying other concurrency requirements, an applicant shall receive concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development order within 90 days of receiving concurrency approval by the city, the project's concurrency vesting shall expire, and the applicant shall be required to re-apply. 
(3)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final plat or building permit whichever occurs first. If the payment is submitted more than six months from the date of execution of the proportionate fair-share agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment. Once a proportionate share payment for a project is made and other impact fees for the project are paid, no refunds shall be given unless otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
(4)  All developer improvements authorized under the fair-share program must be completed as established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. 
(5)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(6)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(7)  Applicants should submit a letter to withdraw from a proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city are nonrefundable. 
(8)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(g)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. At the city's discretion, proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIE, then the proportionate fair share revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that same corridor or sector where the alternative improvement will mitigate the impacts of the development project on the congested roadway or roadways for which the original proportionate fair share contribution was made. 
(h)  Proportionate fair-share program for TCMAs. Within transportation concurrency management areas (TCMAs) designated by the city, the city hereby establishes a proportionate fair-share assessment, based on the expected costs and transportation benefits of all the programmed improvements in the area, and based on the expected trip generation of the proposed development.

Sec. 9-1. - Purpose. 
    This section provides regulations to ensure safe and convenient on-site traffic flow and vehicle parking. The traffic circulation element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan addresses the adequacy with which Hialeah's primary roadway system meets current and projected access and mobility demands. This section should be construed in light of policy 6.1 of the traffic circulation element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan that provides that rights-of-way shall be consistent at a minimum with Miami-Dade County requirements as established in the Public Works Manual. 
Sec. 9-2. - Public facilities and services. 
    Public facilities and services shall meet or exceed the standards established in the capital improvements element of the Hialeah Comprehensive Plan and will be available when needed for the development of property. 
Sec. 9-3. - Traffic flow and vehicle parking. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  Accessway. An unobstructed driveway leading to and from a parking space. 
(2)  Angle parking. A parking space forming an angle less than 90 degrees with the accessway by which it is served. Vehicles exiting such parking spaces shall head in the same direction as required to enter the parking space from the rear. 
(3)  Back-out parking. A parking space so located that a vehicle occupying same must reenter the public right-of-way in a reverse direction. Back-out parking shall be allowed in low density residential districts or areas.

Sec. 10-3. - Plats and platting procedure. 
(a)  Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful to subdivide any property within the City of Hialeah, or to open, grade, or improve any streets therein, or to erect, have constructed or cause to be constructed any residence or other structure on any unplatted land, until a plat of a proposed subdivision has been reviewed and commented on by GMAC, recommended by the planning and zoning board and approved by ordinance of the city council and the mayor. 
(b)  Procedure. Plats require approval in two stages: (1) approval of a tentative plat by the planning and zoning board; and (2) approval of a final plat by ordinance of the city council and the mayor upon recommendation of the planning and zoning board. Approval of a tentative plat shall be considered an initial development order. Approval of a final plat shall be considered a final development order. Final plat must be reviewed and certified for compliance by a registered surveyor prior to adoption of the ordinance approving the final plat. 
(c)  Bond requirements and agreement for construction of improvements. Prior to approval of a final plat, any person, firm or corporation submitting a plat must enter into an agreement with the city to provide for paving of streets, construction of sidewalks, drainage structures, and the installation of adequate water mains, fire hydrants, street lighting and such other improvements deemed necessary by the city council within the subdivision. The agreement for construction of improvements must be accompanied by a bond in an amount not less than 110 percent of the estimated cost of construction. It is recommended that the existing requirement of a surety bond, as provided in Hialeah Code section 98-347(3), be modified to provide submission of a cash bond or letter of credit. 
(d)  Flood hazard disclosure. All subdivision plats shall include an engineer's or surveyor's statement as to which lots, if any, are partially or completely located in an area of special flood hazard identified pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended from time to time.

The property owner must provide written consent from the homeowner's association according to its bylaws, rules or regulations for the improvements. 
(2)  A property owner may apply for a waiver of plat, provided that the improvements are located in the rear yard enclosed by a fence, but outside three feet from the location of the rear fence or outside two feet from the location of the side fence, for only the following structures or improvements:

(3)  A property owner may not apply for a waiver of plat to construct or legalize an addition to the existing residence, an accessory building or any terrace that is enclosed by walls. 
(4)  A certificate of unit verification must be obtained if the zoning designation of the property requires a certificate of reoccupancy prior to the issuance of the waiver of plat. The certificate of unit verification, if issued, shall state that the city has inspected the dwelling and determined that the dwelling complies with the residential occupancy regulations of the zoning district on the property wherein the dwelling unit is located. If the city grants a waiver of plat, a certified copy of the approved waiver shall be recorded in the county public records, with a notation on the plat retained by the city. 
(b)  R-Z residential zero lot line district. 
(1)  If a proposed or existing addition to a residence extends beyond the limits of the building envelope, a property owner may apply for a waiver of plat, provided that the building, if approved, satisfies all other requirements of the R-Z residential zero lot line district, by administrative variance or in the manner of a zoning variance according to the limitations provided in Hialeah Code section 98-931. 
(c)  Temporary waiver of plat. A temporary waiver of plat is of a limited time duration and may be granted only conditioned on obtaining an approved plat within a reasonable time agreed to by the city. 
(d)  Waiver of plat. The city may grant a waiver of plat but only under circumstances that present substantial hardship created by the conditions on the property, but not for financial or economic hardship. A waiver of plat may be granted for development of affordable housing owned and operated by the city. 
(Ord. No. 2010-67, § 1, 11-9-2010) 
Sec. 10-5. - Site plan review.

(b)  The planning and development department shall require that any property with direct access to the state highway system or that any property proposing a modification of access or additional access to the state highway system, shall obtain a department of transportation driveway connection permit prior to concurrency review or issuance of a development order. 
(c)  All site plans required by zoning ordinances shall be analyzed and reviewed by the growth management advisory committee (GMAC), with written comments provided, prior to consideration of the tentative plat by the planning and zoning board. The GMAC shall consist of representatives of the planning and development department, department of water and sewers, police department, fire department and streets department. The individual members of the GMAC shall include the building official or designee, the principal planner, the planning director, the director of water and sewers or designee, the chief of police or designee, the fire chief or designee and the director of streets or designee. 
(Ord. No. 99-52, § 2, 4-27-1999) 
Sec. 10-6. - Protected areas. 
(a)  Environmentally sensitive areas. The city shall protect with compatible land uses those areas which benefit communal well-being and promote natural beauty.
