Chapter 6
ALCOHOLIC LIQUORS
§ 6-1. Generally. [Code 1979, § 7.241]
§ 6-2. Definitions. [Code 1979, § 9.131]
The meaning of "alcoholic liquor" and "license" when used in this chapter
shall be as defined in Act No. 8 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1933 (Extra
Session) (MCL 436.1 et seq., MSA 18.971 et seq.), as amended.
§ 6-3. Waiver of requirements. [Code 1979, § 7.249]
It is recognized that the locations and establishments of tavern licensees
lawfully existing in the City at the time of the adoption of the ordinance
from which this chapter is derived may not conform to all of its present
or future standards. It is not the general intention of this chapter to now
require conformance and the City Council may waive such requirements as
would be impossible, impractical or which would cause undue hardship.
(a) Applicants for a liquor license are asking the people, through their duly
constituted representatives, for a permit to conduct an alcoholic
beverage establishment. No applicant, existing licensee, person or firm
has any right to a license. As no one has a right to a license, any
consideration given to applicants must be secondary to the
requirements of the community at large. Alcoholic beverage licenses
will be approved to foster economic growth of the City at-large and to
provide a service to the community.
(b) It should be generally interpreted that any applicant for a class C liquor
license shall be seeking this license to be used in conjunction with some
primary business activity other than the serving of beer, wine or spirits.
Some examples of this would include restaurants, hotels, motels,
bowling alleys, etc. It shall, however, be the responsibility of the City
Council to evaluate each application on the individual basis and to
determine that each license is in the best interests of the City.
(c) Approval of alcoholic beverage licenses for consumption on the
premises will be contingent upon the ability of the establishment to be
erected and operated within the current standards of existing municipal
ordinances and limitations of state laws and upon the business and
moral character of the prospective licensee or principals thereof.
(d) This chapter shall apply to all applicants seeking any new, or a
reclassification of an existing license, and those terms shall be used in
this chapter interchangeably as having the same meaning,
interpretation and application.
§ 2-357 CORUNNA CODE § 6-4
1:54
§ 6-4. Authority of City Council. [Code 1979, § 7.250]
This chapter shall not operate to limit any power or authority vested in the
City or the City Council by virtue of any existing constitutional or statutory
provision, and shall be considered to be only supplementary to the exercise
or use of such vested authority and not in derogation of such authority.
§ 6-5. Penalty. [Code 1979, § 7.251]
Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and each such person shall be deemed
guilty of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during
which any violation of any provision of this chapter is committed, continued
or permitted, and upon conviction of any such violation such person shall be
punishable as provided in § 1-14.
§ 6-6. Application for license. [Code 1979, § 7.242]
(a) Each applicant seeking any new, or a reclassification of an existing
liquor license, must make an application to the City on forms that will
be provided by the City Clerk. Such an application pertains to City
approval only, and is in addition to the separate application required by
the state liquor control commission.
(b) Upon receipt of an application for a license, it shall be placed on file in
the office of the City Manager. The applicant shall submit to the office of
the City Manager the following:
(1) A minimum of three character references.
(2) A written statement showing history of business activity, if any.
(3) Drawings and written description showing where and how the
proposed establishment will operate.
(4) Evidence that the establishment will conform to the current
standards of existing building ordinances, and other municipal laws
and regulations, and that all new applicants conform to the current
zoning ordinances.
(5) Evidence to show the applicant has the financial ability to complete
his project according to his plans and within a reasonable period of
time.
(6) Any other information that may be requested by the City Manager
that is pertinent to the proper consideration of the application.
(c) If the above information is not received within 60 days from the date of
application, the application will automatically be returned to the
applicant without further consideration. Receipt of the above
information, however, is not a guarantee of acceptance.

§ 6-7. Tentative license approval. [Code 1979, § 7.243]
§ 6-8. Final license approval. [Code 1979, § 7.244]
When the applicant's building or remodeling is completed and it is
determined that the applicant has met all state regulations, current
standards of existing City building and zoning codes, sanitary and fire
regulations, representations made to the City by the applicant and all terms
of the tentative approval resolution the City Council will adopt a resolution
recommending to the state liquor control commission that a license be
issued. A copy of the resolution granting the City's final approval will be
sent to the liquor control commission for final action.
§ 6-9. Renewal, revocation of licenses. [Code 1979, § 7.245]
(d) When all of the above information has been submitted by the applicant,
the City Manager shall cause a thorough investigation to be made of the
persons and premises. The findings and recommendations resulting
from such investigations shall be reported by the City Manager to the
City Council within 60 days of receipt of the application and all required
information.
(a) If the City Council is satisfied that the establishment for which a new
license is requested will constitute an asset to the City and is in the best
interest of the City, it may adopt a resolution granting tentative
approval, subject to satisfaction of conditions stated in the resolution.
(b) Tentative approval is not transferable. Tentative approval is valid for
nine months from the date of issuance, after which time its continuance
is subject to review by the City Council. The City Council may, by
resolution, require an applicant having been granted tentative approval
to furnish evidence six months from the date of issuance of the tentative
approval, that he made reasonable progress toward complying with the
conditions upon which tentative approval was granted. If the applicant
shall fail to present evidence of reasonable progress, the City Council
may withdraw the tentative approval.
(c) "Tentative approval" does not result in the issuance of a license, but
does assure the applicant that the City Council will approve his license
when his building, remodeling or other facilities have been completed
as represented in his presentation to the City, and he has complied with
all terms of the tentative approval resolution.
(d) A copy of the resolution granting tentative approval will be sent to the
state liquor control commission, enabling the commission to complete
its investigation. The phrase "subject to final approval" shall be
included in the tentative approval resolution.
(a) The City Manager shall cause an annual review of each liquor license.
All applicants and licensees should be aware that, once a license is
received, compliance with all state and City regulations is necessary

§ 6-10. Transfer of license. [Code 1979, § 7.246]
§ 6-11. Special requirements. [Code 1979, § 7.247]
and that failure of such compliance can result in the City Council
requesting the state liquor control commission not to renew the license.
(b) At least 60 days before a license is due for renewal, a licensee may
request, in writing, that the City Manager make known his intent to
recommend to the City Council whether the City should or should not
file an objection with the liquor control commission and, if an objection
is to be recommended to the City Council, what corrective action the
licensee must take to be subject for approval. The City Manager shall
have 30 days to acknowledge such request. In no way will
recommended action by the City Manager be considered as approval by
the City Council.
(c) The City Council shall have the right at any time by resolution to
suspend the sale, furnishing or delivery of alcoholic beverages for
consumption on the premises throughout the entire City or any part
thereof, whenever the Council deems such action necessary by reason
of any public emergency. Violation of either of this chapter, the rules
and regulations of the state liquor control commission, or of any law or
ordinance relative to the use of the premises or the conduct of any
licensee, may be used as basis to revoke or suspend either the approval
granted under this chapter or for a request by the City Council to the
state liquor control commission for revocation or suspension of such
licenses. The City Council shall, in matters involving revocation or
suspension by resolution, direct that a hearing be had before the City
Council upon not less than five days' written notice to the approved
licensee involved. Service of such notice may be made personally upon
the licensee, or by posting a copy of the resolution at the premises
where the licensee's sales of alcoholic beverages are conducted or at
his usual place of abode. A majority vote of the members of the City
Council shall be required for the revocation or suspension of any
license.
(a) The transfer of a liquor license, or any interest therein, from a licensee
to another party shall be handled and considered in the same manner as

Domesticated Fowl
§ 11-60. Purpose. [Amended 7-27-2012 by Ord. No. 12-05]
The purpose of this article is to provide standards for the keeping of
domesticated fowl on "single-family residential lots". It is intended to enable
residents to keep a small number of female domesticated fowl on a
noncommercial basis while limiting the potential adverse impacts on the
surrounding neighborhood. The City recognizes that adverse neighborhood
impacts may result from keeping of domesticated fowl as a result of noise,
odor, unsanitary animal living conditions, unsanitary waste storage and
removal, the attraction of predators, rodents, insects, or parasites, and nonconfined
animals leaving the owner's property. This article is intended to
create standards and requirements and ensure that domesticated fowl do
not adversely impact the neighborhood surrounding the property on which
the domesticated fowl are kept. It shall be lawful for any person to keep,
permit or allow any fowl within the corporate limits on any property that
does not fit the definition of "single-family residential lot" as defined within
the definitions of this chapter and further meeting all other terms and
conditions of this section.

purposes of this article, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed
to have been made when at least 10 copies have been received by the
City Clerk. The City Council may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt

operator requests confidentiality and the request is denied, where the
cable operator is proposing a rate increase it may withdraw the
proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be
returned to it; or the cable operator may seek review within five
working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the
information will be stayed pending review.
(b) Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as
proprietary with the City. The City shall weigh the policy considerations
favoring nondisclosure against the reasons cited for permitting

ARTICLE IV
Video Service Provider Right-of-Way Management
§ 22-194. Purpose. [Amended 2-19-2008 by Ord. No. 08-02]
(a) Under the Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act,6 video service
providers may obtain a franchise to provide video services in
municipality using a standardized, uniform form of franchise agreement
established by the MPSC. This form includes the right to use the public
right-of-way to provide such service but does not contain right-of-way
management and related provisions.
(b) Telecommunications providers who obtain such a standardized, uniform
form of franchise agreement generally will have previously obtained
from municipality a permit under the Metro Act to construct and
maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way.
Such Metro Act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such
right-of-way usage, standard forms of such permits were agreed to in a
collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was
initiated by the MPSC, and such standard forms have since been
approved by the legislature and the MPSC.
(c) Because telecommunications providers typically provide video services
over combined video and telecommunications facilities, such Metro Act
permits generally provide adequate public right-of-way related
protections for municipality and the public when such providers are
providing video services.
(d) Other video services providers, in particular new providers or existing
cable companies, may not have a Metro Act permit issued by
municipality.
(e) The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement require video service providers to comply
with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and
occupation of the public right-of-way in the delivery of video services,
including the police powers of the franchising entity, and makes such
right-of-way usage subject to the laws of the State of Michigan and the
police powers of the franchising entity.
(f) The Uniform Video Services Local Franchise Act and the standardized,
uniform franchise agreement state that franchising entities shall
provide video service providers with open, comparable,
nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral access to the public rightof-
way, and may not discriminate against a video service provider for
the authorization or placement of a video service or communications
network in the public right-of-way.

(g) The Michigan Constitution reserves reasonable control of their
highways, streets, alleys and public places to local units of government.
(h) The purpose of this article is to promote and protect the public health,
safety and welfare and exercise reasonable control over the public
right-of-way by regulating the use and occupation of such right-of-way
by video service providers who have a standardized, uniform franchise
but who lack a Metro Act Permit from municipality. This article does so
by setting forth terms and conditions for such usage and occupation

open, comparable, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral access
to the public right-of-way and not discriminating against a video service
provider for the authorization or placement of video service or
communications network in public right-of-way.

place such portion of its facilities underground, unless municipality

public right-of-way within its jurisdiction, and such vacation
necessitates the removal and relocation of permittee's facilities in the
vacated public right-of-way, permittee shall consent to the vacation and
remove its facilities at its sole cost and expense when ordered to do so
by municipality or a court of competent jurisdiction. Permittee shall
relocate its facilities to such alternate route as municipality and

Open Storage
§ 34-101. Conditions creating nuisance. [Code 1979, § 5.231;
amended 9-2-2008 by Ord. No. 08-04]
Inasmuch as old discarded and nonoperating cars, car parts, tractors,
machinery, household appliances, old iron, furniture and household
furnishings which are not intended or designed for outdoor use, debris and
other unsightly objects, if allowed to remain in the open, can be dangerous
to the health of the City in that it allows [they allow] weeds, high grass and
brush to grow up around it [them] in which rats and other rodents frequent,
and can be dangerous to the safety of the citizens in that it is [they are]
an attractive nuisance to children from which children can receive serious
injury or possible suffocation and in that it [they] can create a fire hazard
because of the dead grass and weeds around and can be detrimental to the
general welfare of the City in that it [they] can adversely affect the values
of the adjoining properties, can detract from the general appearance of the
City thereby causing citizens to go elsewhere for their business trading and
their homes; therefore, the storing of such items in areas such as, but not
limited to, exterior balconies, porches, decks, landings, front yards, an open
field, lot or part of lot or any other area exposed to the weather in the City
is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and not allowed except under the
following provisions:
§ 34-102. Definition of open lot. [Code 1979, § 5.232]

as any field, lot or part of lot which is not enclosed with a building or a
noncombustible fence at least eight feet high so constructed and maintained
(1) Items intended for outdoor usage may be allowed to occupy the front
yard if they are located entirely upon porches, decks, patios, and
balconies. Items intended for outdoor usage that are not located upon
porches, decks, patios, and decks within the front yard will be allowed
only if accompanied by the user but may not remain in such front yard
overnight with the exception of items intended and designed for
outdoor decorative purposes.
Front yard for this section is defined as that part of the property
whereby the front of the house faces the public street and encompasses
that open space extending the full width of the lot, the depth of which
is the minimum horizontal distance between the front lot line and the
nearest point of the main building.
(2) At no time shall any allowed outdoor items be permitted to accumulate
on any property to an excessive amount that is deemed unreasonable by

§ 34-120. Purpose and intent. [Amended 8-2-2010 by Ord. No.
10-05; 10-5-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-05]
The City Council finds that repeated sales of various types of personal
property made from properties occupied for residential, charitable,
religious and governmental purposes, wherein newspaper advertisements,
signs or other means of notification invite the general public to shop at
such residential premises, where the property is displayed for sale in the
garage, an outbuilding, in the yard area, in the dwelling, principal building,
or all or a combination of such locations, have become a nuisance to
the community. The Council finds that locations where successive sales
occur create vehicular traffic problems and detract from the tranquility and
privacy of neighborhoods. The Council further finds that this article offers
the minimum regulation necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare
of this community in such regard.

ARTICLE II
Use
§ 46-31. Definitions. [Code 1979, § 5.272]
As used in this article the terms "house trailer" and "mobile home" shall
be used interchangeably and shall mean a movable or portable dwelling
constructed to be towed on its own chassis and designed for permanent
yearround living as a single-family dwelling. The term "house trailer" or
"mobile home" shall not include motor homes, recreational vehicles
(whether licensed or not as a motor vehicle), or other transportable
structures designed for temporary use which are not designed primarily for
a permanent residence and connection to sanitary sewage, electrical power
and potable water utilities.
§ 46-32. Intent. [Code 1979, § 5.271]
While house trailers and mobile homes offer an alternative to conventional
single-family housing in such areas as structural design, facility
arrangement and cost, they can have potential adverse impacts on a
residential neighborhood because of marked differences from single-family
housing in design, placement, structure and site size, and fire and wind
resistance. Generally, mobile homes have been restricted to locations within
mobile home parks, positioned at areas specifically zoned for them, in order
to ensure compatibility with nearby residential uses. However, through the
application of certain standards, mobile homes and mobile home sites may
be designed to more closely resemble nearby conventional housing and
be permitted outside of mobile home parks and within residential zoning
districts. This article presents specific conditions and standards whereby
mobile homes and house trailers may be located outside of mobile home
parks.
§ 46-33. Location. [Code 1979, § 5.273]
Mobile homes may be located outside of mobile home parks provided that
they are located in zoning districts that permit them. The premises upon
which they shall be located shall meet all requirements of the City
ordinances relating to the uses, size of premises, floor area, setback, side
lot and rear lot requirements specified for the particular zoning district in
which the premises is situated.
§ 46-34. Compatibility in appearance. [Code 1979, § 5.274]
To ensure compatibility in appearance with single-family housing in the
neighborhood, a mobile home shall meet the following design requirements:
(1) Roof: must be pitched, minimum 3:12 slope, and shingled, with a
minimum roof overhang of six inches on all sides. The roof must be
permanently attached to the mobile home and supported by the mobile
home, rather than by external supports. Additions and accessory
§ 46-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 46-34
1:211
§ 46-35. Appeal. [Code 1979, § 5.275]
In the first instance, it shall be the responsibility of the building inspector
to determine whether the design and appearance of a mobile home is
aesthetically comparable to homes in the zoning district. The building
inspector may, in his discretion, refer the matter to the Board of Appeals
for the determination. Any party aggrieved by the adverse decision by
the building inspector may appeal to the Board of Appeals, which board
shall make a determination based upon its independent judgment without
reference to the standards for the granting of variances. The standards set
forth in § 46-33 shall be applied in making this determination.
§ 46-36. Construction specifications; anchorage; utilities, fuel tank
containers; sidewalks, driveways, parking facilities; fencing. [Code
1979, § 5.276]
buildings may have flat roofs, but unattached accessory buildings must
satisfy the same roof requirements as the mobile home.
(2) Exterior walls: must be covered with a siding material which is in color,
texture, malleability, directional joints, and methods of fastening to the
structure comparable to siding of homes typically found in the
neighborhood in which it is located.
(3) Eave troughs: must be provided where appropriate.
(4) Ceiling height: minimum seven feet, six inches for all rooms.
(5) Doors: The mobile home shall have two doors located where they may
provide alternate emergency exit routes for the maximum feasible
portion of the residential unit. The dwelling shall have front and rear or
front and side exterior doors if such a combination of doors is found in a
majority of homes in the neighborhood in which it is located.
(6) Windows: must be similar in design to single-family housing, with glass
recessed at least 1 1/2 inches behind the exterior surface of its siding.
(7) Steps: must be permanently attached on a frost-depth foundation
similar to single-family housing requirements, and connected to the
exterior door areas or to porches connected to the door areas where a
difference in elevation requires them.
(8) Garage: A one car garage or a two car garage must be built if such a
garage is found in the majority of the homes in the zoning district in
which it is located.
(9) Mechanical equipment: All mechanical equipment except for room air
conditioners and television antennas shall be concealed from view from
public rights-of-way. It shall not have any exposed towing mechanism or
undercarriage.

ordinances, may be substituted for the forty-two-inch cement block or
poured foundation. If the foundation or basement does not meet the
mobile home manufacturer's specification for pillar placement and
imposed load capacity, adequate additional support shall be provided as
specified in R125.1602 of the Michigan Administrative Code. Wheels
and axles shall be removed, and the underside or chassis of the mobile
home shall be completely enclosed.
(b) Unit size and additions. A mobile home, prior to any addition, shall have
minimum length of no less than 40 feet. That portion of the mobile home
facing the public street shall have a minimum width of 24 feet and meet
the minimum floor area requirements for the zoning district in which
the mobile home is located. Any additions to a mobile home must either
be constructed by a licensed mobile home manufacturer or satisfy the
applicable City codes and ordinances for single-family residences. Any
addition must be similar in appearance, material and foundation to the
mobile home itself. Any addition to a mobile home is subject to the same
review procedures of this section as for the mobile home itself.
(c) Anchorage. A mobile home shall be anchored by an anchoring system
meeting the standards and specifications of R125.1605 of the Michigan
Administrative Code.

sewer, telephone, electrical, heating and cooking fuels and television
service, shall be located underground, except in instances where the
majority of single-family residences in the neighborhood are served by
aboveground lines for the particular service. Utility and service lines,
except for electrical and natural gas, shall be designed for permanent
attachment to the mobile home using, wherever feasible, the same
designs and specifications as for single-family housing in accordance
with applicable city-adopted codes and ordinances. An exterior water
faucet is required.
(f) Electrical service. Electrical service installation shall be in accordance
with R125.1932 and R125.1933 of the Michigan Administrative Code.

natural gas service pedestal shall be screened from view from the
adjoining street by the mobile home itself or by opaque ornamental
fencing.

screened from view from the adjoining street by the mobile home itself,
by enclosure in a storage shed or by opaque ornamental fencing.
(i) Sidewalks, driveways and parking. A mobile home site shall comply
with the same City codes and ordinances relative to sidewalk, driveway
and parking placement, sizing and construction as for single-family
housing.

§ 58-17. Construction and maintenance. [Amended 8-15-2006 by
Ord. No. 06-02]
All signs shall be designed and constructed in conformity to the provisions
for materials, loads, stresses, and safety of the latest adopted edition of
the Uniform Sign Code (Article I of this chapter). Nothing contained in the
Uniform Sign Code shall be construed to permit any sign prohibited by
the Corunna Sign Ordinance or to reduce any standard established by said
ordinance.
Every sign in the City, including those signs for which permits are required,
or exempt signs for which no permits are required, shall be maintained in
good structural condition at all times. All signs, including exempt signs,
shall be kept neatly painted, including metal parts and supports. The
administrator shall, from time to time, inspect and have the authority to
order the painting, repair, alteration or removal of signs which become
dilapidated or abandoned, or which constitute a physical hazard to public
safety.
§ 58-18. Removal of certain signs. [Amended 8-15-2006 by Ord. No.
06-02]
In the event a sign is abandoned for a period of time in excess of six
months, the sign owner shall immediately remove any sign identifying the
abandoned use or purpose announced thereby. Upon failure of a sign owner
to comply with this section, the building inspector shall issue a written
notice to the sign owner, which notice shall state that such sign shall be
removed with 14 days. If the sign owner fails to comply with such written
notice to remove, the building inspector is hereby authorized to cause
removal of such sign, and any expense incidental to such removal shall be
charged to the owner of the property upon which the sign is located and
shall constitute a lien upon the property. For the purpose of this section, the
word "remove" shall mean:
(1) The sign face, along with posts, columns, or supports of freestanding
signs, shall be taken down and removed from the property.
(2) The sign face and supporting structures of "projecting", "roof", or "wall"
signs shall be taken down and removed from the property.
(3) The sign face of "painted wall signs" shall be removed by painting over
the wall sign in such a manner as to completely cover up and hide from
sight the sign in question. This provision shall not apply to signs 50
years old or older that are historical landmarks of the City's past and
are attached to a building that is maintained and preserved as an
architectural landmark provided they are properly maintained. The
historic criteria adopted by the Planning Commission and or the
Corunna Historical Commission shall serve to distinguish these signs.

maintained by the City, county, state, or federal governments, and
except those projecting canopy and marquee signs mounted on building
walls and allowed in the C-1 zoning district where no front yard setback
is required shall be located in, project into, or overhang a public rightof-
way or dedicated public easement.
(2) Signs at intersections. Signs shall be located such that there is at every
street intersection or entranceway a clear view between heights of
three feet and 10 feet in a triangle formed by the corner and points on
the curb 25 feet from the intersection or entranceway. A support
structure six inches in diameter or less or six inches per side or less
shall not be considered an obstruction to a clear view.
(3) Bed-and-breakfast signs. Where according to City Code, a Bed-andbreakfast
operation is allowed, one wall sign not exceeding four square
feet in size and one yard sign set back a minimum of five feet from the
right-of-way and not exceeding six square feet of display area shall be
allowed.
(4) Institutional bulletin board. One sign allowed per lot of record
containing a surface area not to exceed [sic] [fifty (24)] square feet and
a height not exceeding six feet upon which is displayed the name of a
religious institution, school, library, community center or similar
institution and the announcement of its institutional services or
activities. This sign is allowed as a bonus sign over and above the
maximum signage allowed within the appropriate district such lot of
record exists.
(5) Traffic interference. No advertising device shall be erected or
maintained which simulates or imitates in size, color, lettering, or
design any traffic sign or signal or other work, phrase, symbol or
character in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead, or confuse
traffic.
(6) Responsibility of compliance. The owner of any property on which a
sign is placed, and the person maintaining said sign, are equally
responsible for the condition of the sign and the area in the vicinity
thereof.
(7) Obstructions to doors, windows, sidewalks, and fire escapes. No sign
shall be erected, relocated or maintained so as to prevent free ingress
or egress from any door, window, sidewalk or fire escape.

1:273
§ 58-22. Calculation of sign area. [Amended 8-15-2006 by Ord. No.
06-02]
The following principle shall control the calculation of sign area:
(8) Temporary/portable signs. Allowed for a business only in the residential
office, commercial, multi-family, and industrial zoned areas, and shall
not be located any closer than five feet from the right-of-way nor shall
they exceed 32 square feet in display area. No temporary/portable sign
shall be allowed for a business more than four times a year and shall not
exist more than 15 consecutive days each time.
(9) Gasoline price signs. A gasoline service station shall be permitted signs
on each pump island indicating the prices and types of gasoline and the
type of service. The area of such signs shall not exceed 10 square feet
per pump island. One freestanding sign to include a changeable copy
sign or reader board is allowed. The size of the freestanding sign shall
not exceed 48 square feet.
(10) Light glare. No direct light or significant glare from a sign shall be cast
onto any zone lot that is zoned and or used for residential purposes or
onto any public way so as to cause interference with traffic safety.
(11) Adjoining sign interference. Signs shall not reasonably interfere with
the noticeability, visibility, and legibility of existing conforming signs on
adjoining zoning lots. Any dispute shall be resolved by the building
inspector.
(12) Festoon signs, balloons, and inflated objects used as signs. Said signs
are regulated as a temporary sign with further restrictions placed on
them as regulated in § 58-24 of this Code.
(13) Billboards. No outdoor billboards are allowed within the City limits
other than those signs defined in other sections of the City Code.
(1) Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which
is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall
be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits
of the writing, representation emblem or other display, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the
display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which is placed, but not including any supporting framework,
bracing, or decorative fence, embellishment or wall when such fence,
wall, or embellishment otherwise meets the requirements of this
chapter, Chapter 86 (zoning), and is clearly incidental to the display
itself.
(2) Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area of a sign with
more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are
placed back-to-back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point
§ 58-21 CORUNNA CODE § 58-22
1:274
§ 58-23. (Reserved)
at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of the largest face.
(3) Computation of maximum total permitted sign area for a zoning lot of
record. The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a zoned
lot of record shall be computed by applying the directions in § 58-24 of
this chapter and any other requirements as defined under other City of
Corunna Ordinances.

06-02]
It is the intent of this chapter to encourage eventual elimination of signs
that, as a result of the adoption of this chapter, become nonconforming.
It is considered as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as the
prohibition of new signs in violation of this chapter. It is the intent,
therefore, to administer this chapter to realize the removal of illegal
nonconforming signs and to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established
private property rights.
A nonconforming sign may be continued, and shall be maintained in good
condition, but shall not be:
nuisance or safety hazard on any property located within or adjacent to
the City limits.
(1) Abandoned signs.
(2) Banner signs extending over public property, except as authorized by
the City.
(3) Roof signs, except mansard roof signs which are regulated as wall

or placed on any public property, or public right-of-way, except signs of
any political subdivision of the state.

primary purpose of displaying said sign except as authorized under
§ 34-120 thru § 34-124 (garage sales) of the Corunna City Code Book.
(8) Any sign structure or frame no longer containing a sign and classified
as abandoned.
(9) Signs indicating a home occupation, including child care.

(4) Re-established after damage or destruction if the estimated expense of
reconstruction exceeds 50% of the estimated replacement cost.
(1) Bonus for symbolic presentation. Projecting signs using symbolic rather
than alphabetic or numerical message presentation are permitted an
additional size allowance of up to 20% over the maximum size
allowances provided that the total symbolic presentation comprises at
least 75% of the total sign area used.
(2) Bonus for use of upper and lower case letters. In the case of signs
composed of individual letters or words mounted upon a wall or other
architectural surface not in itself a sign, the calculation of overall
square footage shall be the product of the overall height of the
letterforms and the overall length. In the case of signs consisting of
upper and lower case letterforms, calculation of overall square footage
shall be the product of the height of the lower case letter forms only and
the overall length.

owner or party in interest, or his agent, may appear in person at the
hearing to protest the special assessment or may file his appearance or
protest by letter and his personal appearance shall not be required. The
notice shall further include a statement that the owner or any party
having an interest in the real property may file a written appeal of the
special assessment with the state tax tribunal within 30 days after the
confirmation of the special assessment roll if that special assessment
was protested at the hearing held for the purpose of confirming the roll.

§ 66-7. Conduct of hearing. [Code 1979, § 1.117]
At the public hearing on the proposed improvement, all persons interested

modify the scope of the local public improvement in such a manner as
it shall deem to be in the best interest of the City as a whole; provided,
that if the amount of work is increased or additions are made to the
district, then another hearing shall be held pursuant to notice prescribed
in § 66-6. If the determination of the Council shall be to proceed with
the improvement, a resolution shall be passed approving the necessary
profiles, plans, specifications, assessment district and detailed estimates of
cost, and directing the Assessor to prepare a special assessment roll in
accordance with the Council's determination and report it to the Council for
confirmation.
§ 66-8. Deviation from plans and specifications. [Code 1979,
§ 1.118]
No deviation from original plans or specifications as adopted pursuant to
this chapter shall be permitted by any officer or employee of the City
without authority of the Council by resolution. A copy of the resolution

§ 1.120]

§ 66-12. Review of special assessment roll; objections in writing.
[Code 1979, § 1.122]
Upon receipt of the special assessment roll the Council, by resolution, shall
accept the assessment roll and order it to be filed in the office of the City
Clerk for public examination, shall fix the time and place the Council will
meet to review such special assessment roll and direct the City Clerk to
give notice of a public hearing for the purpose of affording an opportunity
for interested persons to be heard. Such notice shall be given by one
publication in a newspaper published or circulated within the City and by
first class mail addressed to each owner of or person in interest in property
to be assessed as shown by the last general tax assessment roll of the City,
the publication and mailing to be made at least 10 full days prior to the

all interested persons or parties shall present in writing their objections, if

§ 66-13. Changes, corrections in assessment roll. [Code 1979,
§ 1.123]
The Council shall meet at the time and place designated for the review of
the special assessment roll, and at such meeting, or a proper adjournment
thereof, shall consider all objections to the roll submitted in writing. The
Council may correct the roll as to any special assessment or description
of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein; or it may,
by resolution, annul the assessment roll and direct that new proceedings
be instituted. The same proceedings shall be followed in making a new
roll as in the making of the original roll. If, after hearing all objections
and making a record of such changes as the Council deems justified the
Council determines that it is satisfied with the special assessment roll and
that assessments are in proportion to benefits received, it shall thereupon
pass a resolution reciting such determinations, confirming the roll, placing
it on file in the office of the City Clerk and directing the City Clerk to attach
his warrant to a certified copy thereof within 10 days, therein commanding
the Assessor to spread and the treasurer to collect the various sums and
amounts appearing on the roll as directed by the Council. The roll shall
have the date of confirmation endorsed thereon and shall from that date be
final and conclusive for the purpose of the improvement to which it applies,
subject only to adjustment to conform to the actual cost of the improvement,
as provided in § 66-19.
§ 66-14. Overwhelming objection to assessment. [Code 1979,
§ 1.124]
If at or prior to the final confirmation of any special assessments, more
than 50% of the number of owners of privately owned real property to
be assessed for an improvement, or in the case of paving or similar
improvements more than 50% of the number of owners of frontage to be
§ 66-12 CORUNNA CODE § 66-14
1:322
assessed for any such improvement, shall object in writing to the proposed
improvement, the improvement shall not be made by proceedings
delineated by this chapter without a five-sixths vote of the members elect
of the Council; provided, that this section shall not apply to sidewalk
construction.
§ 66-15. When assessment due. [Code 1979, § 1.125]
All special assessments, except such installments as the Council shall make
payable at a future time as provided in this chapter, shall be due and
payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll.
§ 66-16. Partial payments, when due. [Code 1979, § 1.126]
The Council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual
installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed 30 in number, the
first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll or on such date as
the Council may determine and deferred installments being due annually
thereafter or, in the discretion of the Council, may be spread upon and made
a part of each annual City tax roll thereafter until all are paid. Interest
shall be charged on all deferred installments at a rate not to exceed 7% per
annum, commencing on the due date of the first installment and payable on
the due date of each subsequent installment; the full amount of all or any
deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment,
may be paid in advance of the due dates thereof. If the full assessment or
the first installment thereof shall be due upon confirmation, each property
owner shall have 60 days from the date of confirmation to pay the full
amount of the assessment, or the full amount of any installments, without
interest or penalty. Following the sixty-day period, the assessment or first
installment shall, if unpaid, be considered as delinquent and the same
penalties shall be collected on such unpaid assessments or first installments
as are provided in the Charter to be collected on delinquent general City
taxes. Deferred installments shall be collected without penalty until 60 days
after the due date, after which time such installments shall be considered
as delinquent and the penalties on the installments shall be collected as are
provided in the Charter to be collected on delinquent general City taxes.
After the Council has confirmed the roll, the City Treasurer shall notify by
mail each property owner on the roll that the roll has been filed, stating the
amount assessed and the terms of payment. Failure on the part of the City
Treasurer to give the notice or of such owner to receive the notice shall not
invalidate any special assessment roll of the City or any assessment thereon,
nor excuse the payment of interest or penalties.
§ 66-17. Delinquent special assessments. [Code 1979, § 1.127]
Any assessment, or part thereof, remaining unpaid on the first Monday of
March following the date when it became delinquent shall be reported as
unpaid by the treasurer to the Council. Any such delinquent assessment,
together with all accrued interest, shall be transferred and reassessed on
the next annual City tax roll in a column headed "Special Assessments"
§ 66-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66-17
1:323
with a penalty of 4% upon the total amount added thereto, and when
so transferred and reassessed upon the tax roll shall be collected in all
respects as provided for the collection of City taxes.
§ 66-18. Creation of lien. [Code 1979, § 1.128]
Special assessments and all interest, penalties and charges thereon from
the date of confirmation of the roll shall become a debt to the City from the
persons to whom they are assessed, and, until paid, shall be and remain a
lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect as the lien
created by general law for state and county taxes and by the Charter for
City taxes, and the lands upon which they are a lien shall be subject to sale
therefor the same as are lands upon which delinquent City taxes constitute
a lien.
§ 66-19. Additional assessments, refunds. [Code 1979, § 1.129]
The City Clerk shall, within 60 days after the completion of each local or
special public improvement, compile the actual cost of the improvement
and certify the cost to the Assessor who shall adjust the special assessment
roll to correspond therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than
necessary by 5% or less, it shall be reported to the Council which may place
the excess in the City treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according
to the assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by
more than 5%, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property
as shown by the City assessment roll upon which the assessment has been
levied, pro rata according to the assessment; provided, however, that no
refunds of special assessments may be made which impair or contravene
the provision of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or
part by such special assessments. When any special assessment roll shall
prove insufficient to meet the cost of the improvement for which it was
made, the Council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the
total amount assessed against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the
benefits received by the lot or parcel of land.
§ 66-20. Additional procedures. [Code 1979, § 1.130]
In any case where the provisions of this chapter may prove to be insufficient
to carry out fully the making of any special assessment, the Council shall
provide by ordinance any additional steps or procedures required.
§ 66-21. Single lot assessments. [Code 1979, § 1.12]
Pursuant to § 7.8 of the Charter, when any expense shall have been incurred
by the City upon or in respect to any single premises, which expense is
chargeable against the premises and the owner of the premises under the
provisions of this Code and is not of that class required to be prorated
among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district,
an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense was
incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which
§ 66-17 CORUNNA CODE § 66-21
1:324
the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be
reported to the treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner,
if known. The treasurer at the end of each quarter shall report to the City
Council all sums so owing to the City and which have not been paid within
30 days after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Council shall, at such
times as it may deem advisable, direct the Assessor to prepare a special
assessment roll covering all such charges reported to it together with a
penalty of 10%. Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall advise
the Council of the filing, and the Council shall thereupon set a date for the
hearing of objections to the assessment roll. The assessment roll shall be
open to public inspection for a period of seven days before the Council shall
meet to review the roll and hear complaints. The City Clerk shall give notice
in advance by publication of the opening of the roll to public inspection
and of the meeting of the Council to hear complaints and shall also give
like notice to the owners of the property affected by first class mail at their
addresses as shown on the current general assessment roll of the City, at
least 10 days prior to the date of the hearing. Such special assessments and
all interest and charges thereon shall, from the date of confirmation of the
roll, be and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character
and effect as a lien created by general law for state and county taxes, until
paid. The same penalty and interest shall be paid on such assessments,
when delinquent from such date after confirmation as shall be fixed by the
Council, as are provided by the Charter to be paid on delinquent general
City taxes and such assessments, which penalties and interest, shall be
added by the treasurer to the next general City tax roll or general county
and school tax roll, as shall be convenient, and shall thereafter be collected
and returned in the same manner as general City taxes.
§ 66-22. Authorization of special assessment bonds. [Code 1979,
§ 1.139]
Bonds issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments and
general obligation bonds evidencing the City's share of the cost of any local
public improvement may be authorized by resolution of the City Council.
§ 66-23. Collection of special assessments; payment of bond. [Code
1979, § 1.131]
If bonds are issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments
as provided in this chapter, all collections on each special assessment roll
or combination of rolls shall be set in a separate fund for the payment of the
principal and interest on the bonds so issued in anticipation of the payment
of the special assessments, and shall be used for no other purpose.
§ 66-24. Special assessment accounts. [Code 1979, § 1.132]
Moneys raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local
improvements shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay
any money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be
used only for the improvement project for which the assessment was levied,
§ 66-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 66-24
1:325
expenses incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal and
interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments,
if refunds are authorized.
§ 66-25. Contested assessments. [Code 1979, § 1.133]
No suit or action of any kind shall be constituted or maintained for the
purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment
unless within 30 days after the confirmation of the special assessment
roll written notice is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or
action, stating the grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal,
and unless such suit or action shall be commenced within 60 days after
confirmation of the roll.
§ 66-26. Reassessment for benefits. [Code 1979, § 1.134]
Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or
defective for any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction
shall have adjudged the assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in
whole or in part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment
to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was
made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed
and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All
proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection of it shall be
made in the manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion
of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it
shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that
extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have
been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such
payment.
§ 66-27. Combination of projects. [Code 1979, § 1.135]
The Council may combine several districts into one project for the purpose
of effecting a saving in the costs; provided, however, that for each district
there shall be established separate funds and accounts to cover the cost of
the project.
§ 66-28. Deferred payments. [Code 1979, § 1.136]
The Council may provide for the deferred payment of special assessments
from persons who, in the opinion of the Council and Assessor, by reason
of poverty are unable to contribute toward the cost. In all such cases, as a
condition to the granting of such deferred payments, the City shall require
mortgage security on the real property of the beneficiary payable on or
before his death or, in any event, on the sale or transfer of the property.
§ 66-29. Reconsideration of petitions. [Code 1979, § 1.137]
If the Council shall fail to make any public improvement petitioned for under
the provisions of § 66-4 during the calendar year during which any petition
§ 66-24 CORUNNA CODE § 66-29
1:326
is filed, the petition shall be reconsidered by the Council prior to March 1
of the succeeding calendar year for the purpose of determining whether the
improvement should be made during such calendar year.
§ 66-30. Hazards and nuisances. [Code 1979, § 1.138]
When any lot, building or structure within the City, because of the
accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled growing of weeds, or age
or dilapidation, or because of any other condition or happening, becomes, in
the opinion of the Council, a public hazard or nuisance which is dangerous
to the health or safety of the inhabitants of the City or those of them
residing or habitually going near such lot, building or structure, the Council
may, after investigation, give notice to the owner of the land upon which
such hazard or nuisance exists, or the owner of the building or structure
itself, specifying the nature of the hazard or nuisance, and requiring the
owner to alter, repair, tear down or remove it promptly and within a time to
be specified by the Council, which shall be commensurate with the nature
of the hazard or nuisance. If, at the expiration of the time limit in the notice,
the owner has not complied with the requirements of the notice, or in any
case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is
not known, the Council may order such a hazard or nuisance abated by
the proper department or agency of the City which is qualified to do the
work required, and the costs of such abatement assessed against the lot,
premises or description of real property upon which the hazard or nuisance
was located.

property owner shall clear the inner five feet of the sidewalk closest to
the property line and extending to the curb of any adjacent crosswalks,
as well as maintaining a thirty-inch clear walkway to the curb in front of
the property. If the owner fails to remove such snow, ice, dirt, debris or
obstruction from the sidewalk within the time limited in this article for
the removal of the same, the City may, given 24 hours' warning notice,

removal shall be assessed against the owner of the property.
(c) Clearing by City upon failure of owner to comply. Report of snow, ice,
dirt or debris removals shall be made promptly to the Clerk by the
Superintendent of Public Works, setting forth the names of the owner of
each lot or parcel from the sidewalks of which snow, ice, dirt or debris
has been removed, together with the expense thereof. Upon receiving
such report the Clerk shall give notice of such expense to the owner of
the premises and demand payment thereof to include an additional

the treasurer within 35 days. Such notice shall be given by first class
mail sent to the last known address of the owner (as shown on the
assessment roll of the City) or by publication. Where payment is not
made within such time limit the Clerk shall report this fact to the
Assessor who shall spread such amounts charged against the several
persons or descriptions of real property chargeable therewith on the
next tax roll for the collection of City taxes. The special assessment is
subject to review after proper notice has been given as in all other
cases of special assessments provided for by law. When confirmed, the
assessment shall be a lien upon the lot, lots or premises the same as
other special assessments, and the Council shall order the treasurer of
the City to spread the amount, together with the penalty, upon the roll
§ 70-45 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-45

from which the snow and ice is to be removed and deposited within the
street. The City Manager shall make such further regulations as shall be
necessary in order to properly manage the removal of such additional snow
so deposited within City streets. No permit owner shall fail to comply with
all such regulations.
§ 70-47. Marquees, canopies, other structures. [Code 1979, § 4.41]
No person shall erect or maintain any marquee, canopy, awning, clock or
other structure or object so it projects over or upon the limits of any street
or alley without first obtaining a permit and filing a liability insurance policy
as required by § 70-33. Every liability insurance policy required by this
section shall be maintained by the permittee permanently in force. Every
such insurance policy shall contain a clause obligating the insurer to give
the City Clerk, by registered or certified mail, at least 10 days' written
notice before the cancellation, expiration, lapse or other termination of such
insurance and such liability policy shall name the City as an additional
named insured. No such permit shall be granted unless the proposed plans
for the marquee or other structure shall be in conformity with the building
code. If the marquee or other structure shall thereafter be found unsafe
or is not maintained in a sightly condition, or if the liability insurance
policy covering the marquee or other structure is not maintained, the
marquee or other structure shall be deemed a street encroachment. The
City Manager shall notify the permittee to remove or repair the marquee or
other structure within 10 days or to reinstate the insurance forthwith, and
upon failure of the permittee to comply with the notice such encroachment
shall be removed as provided in this article. No such marquee or other

on premises owned by him or on the extension of the lawn adjacent to his
premises to grow over or upon any sidewalk less than eight feet above
the surface of such sidewalk. Every such owner shall remove all dead,
as a special assessment upon the lot, lots or premises. The assessment
shall be collected in the same manner as other City taxes.
(d) Notice of requirements. The City Clerk shall on or before November 1 of
each year give notice of requirements and provisions of this article by
publishing a notice once a week for two successive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City.
§ 70-45 CORUNNA CODE § 70-48
1:336

a menace to the safety of the public. All shrubs or bushes located on the
triangle formed by two right-of-way lines at the intersection of two streets
and extending for a distance of 25 feet each way from the intersection of
the right-of-way lines on any corner lot shall not be permitted to grow to
a height of more than 30 inches above the sidewalk grade. Trees may be
planted and maintained in this area provided that all branches are trimmed
to maintain a clear vision for a vertical height of eight feet above the
roadway surface. Any owner of property failing to trim any trees, shrubs or
bushes in conformity with this section shall be notified by the City Manager
to do so, and such notice shall require trimming in conformity with this

The Superintendent shall have authority to temporarily close any street or
portion thereof when he shall deem the street to be unsafe or temporarily
unsuitable for use for any reason. He shall cause suitable barriers and signs
to be erected on the street, indicating that it is closed to public travel. When
any street or portion thereof has been closed to public travel, no person
shall drive any vehicle upon or over the street except as may be necessary
incidentally to any street repair or construction work being done in the
area closed to public travel. No person shall move or interfere with any

§ 70-52. Driveway general requirements. [Amended 8-1-2011 by
Ord. No. 2011-03]
Any work to be accomplished with the right-of-way of any street, under the
jurisdiction of the City Department of Public Works requires a permit before
commencement of such work. Permits will be issued only on those forms
approved by the City. Such permit forms are available at Corunna City Hall,
402 North Shiawassee Street, Corunna, MI 48817.
Pursuant to Act 200 of the Public Acts of 1969, § 4 thereof, charges the
highway authority with the responsibility to issue driveway permits
consistent with the rules promulgated by the highway authority for public
safety and in the public interest.
The property owner or his agent shall maintain all driveways and
improvements set forth in the permit.
When the type of volume of traffic using an existing driveway changes,
because of a change in land use or roadside development to a more
intensified classification requiring a redesign to a higher design standard,
the owner, organization, or person responsible for operation of the driveway
may be required to obtain and correct the driveway or driveways to the
standard contained in these rules.
In the event of a failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any
permit issued in accordance with these rules or failure to obtain an
appropriate permit, the Department of Public Works shall have the right
to halt such activity until such time that adequate compliance is made. All
costs incurred by the City in correcting the following:
(2) Minimum pavement surface shall be seven inches of concrete or
equivalent thickness of asphalt.
(3) Curb and gutter shall be included wherever storm sewer is
available on the street.
(b) Local street specifications. Reconstruction of existing streets and
construction of new streets defined as local streets under Act No. 51 of
the Public Acts of Michigan of 1951 (MCL 247.651 et seq.), as amended,

engineering representative. The specifications must be approved by the
City Council at the time the street work is proposed.
(c) Financing of street construction. Street construction work will be
financed by funds provided under Act No. 51 of the Public Acts of
Michigan of 1951 (MCL 247.651 et seq.), as amended, and/or general
obligation tax revenues. An exception to this section shall be streets
constructed in subdivisions which will be the responsibility of the
developer to construct.
(1) A failure to comply with conditions and standards of a permit,

1:338
§ 70-53. Residential driveways. [Amended 8-1-2011 by Ord. No.
2011-03]
Definition. All driveways for the purpose of serving the residents of a singleor
two-family dwelling shall be deemed to be a residential driveway.
Design features. No portion of the driveway entrance within the street or
highway right-of-way shall have a grade greater than 10% (one foot vertical
in 10 feet horizontal).
All drives shall enter perpendicular to the existing street or highway.
Typical driveway design features, including geometric, can be found in
the appendix. The property owner shall follow these standards unless the
Department of Public Works gives approval to do otherwise.
§ 70-54. Culvert and drainage requirements. [Amended 8-1-2011 by
Ord. No. 2011-03]
The Department of Public Works or its agents shall determine whether or
not a culvert is required and, if required, the size (diameter) and length
of the culvert. The property owner shall furnish, install and maintain the
culvert so determined including clearing of dirt, debris or other
obstructions that may occur over time.
All culvert pipes used shall be of adequate size to carry the anticipated
natural flow of the ditch. The culvert size shall be determined by the
Department of Public Works. The standard for minimum diameter size shall
be 15 inches or larger. A diameter variance may be allowed as determined
by the Department of Public Works. In no case shall a diameter less than 12
inches be allowed.
The minimum length of culvert may be determined as the width of the
approach over the culvert plus the fore slopes on each side of the approach
to the ditch bottom. The maximum fore slope is one on three. Minimum
length of culvert allowed shall be not less than 30 feet in length. Example:
If the ditch is three feet deep, the slope must travel three feet horizontal
before it travels one foot vertical (three-foot depth by three-foot horizontal
equals nine feet of slope on each side of drive approach).
Culverts shall be installed in line with and on the same grade as the road
ditch. Notwithstanding, the Department of Public Works may require that
the applicant regrade the ditch at his or her expense in order to provide
adequate cover over the culvert. The cover, or depth of material over the
culvert, should be equal to or greater than the diameter of the pipe.
(2) A failure to obtain a permit, or
(3) Defective workmanship or materials,
shall be borne by the applicant (or person undertaking the activity).
§ 70-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-54
1:339
All culverts shall be N-12 dual wall plastic or corrugated metal pipe of
the proper gauge corresponding to its diameter, as shown below. Alternate
materials may be used as specified on this page.
Diameter Gauge No.
15" - 24" 16
30" - 36" 14
42" - 54" 12
60" - 72" 10
Other work, such as extending, tiling or filling of ditch will not be allowed
without a separate permit from the Department of Public Works.
Use of alternate materials. Department of public works standards allow the
use of corrugated metal or dual wall (N-12) plastic culvert for drainage
under driveways. Alternate materials may be used, but applicant must
obtain separate approval from the Department of Public Works. A signed
application to construct a driveway is not an approval to use such material.
All alternate material will be visually inspected and approved by a
Department of Public Works representative before placement to ensure its
strength and quality.
For example, if concrete pipe is to be used, it must have no visible defects,
be free of all voids and cracks, and the bell and spigot end must not be
damaged in any way.
Location. A residential driveway approach shall be located to provide
adequate sight distance for exiting and entering movements (see sight
distance section). The Department of Public Works reserves the right to
reject a location that is not in the best interest of public safety.
All portions of a residential driveway, including the radii, shall be located
entirely within the owner's property lines extended at right angles to the
centerline of the road. This requirement does not apply to joint driveways
(see below).
No portion of a residential driveway, including the radii, shall be located
closer than 50 feet to the nearest right-of-way line of an intersecting street,
or 15 feet from the edge of the driveway surface to the nearest adjoining
property line.
No portion of two residential driveways serving the same property,
including the radii, shall be located closer than 50 feet, measured parallel
to the centerline of the road.
Number of driveways. One driveway is allowed for residential property,
held in one piece, with frontage less than or equal to 100 feet. One
additional residential driveway may be permitted for each 70 feet of
frontage in excess of the first 100 feet of frontage.
Two residential driveways may be permitted, in lieu of the above
requirement, to serve a circle driveway if the frontage of the property is
100 feet or more.
§ 70-54 CORUNNA CODE § 70-54
1:340
Joint driveway (common driveway). When both property owners abutting
a common property line agree, they may construct a joint residential
driveway, which shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and a maximum
width of 30 feet. A joint driveway shall be for two homes and cannot
provide access to any additional homes or future building lots. Joint
driveways must be approved by the City zoning department.
§ 70-55. Sight distance and clear vision requirements. [Amended
8-1-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-03]
To provide adequate vision when entering and exiting all drives that adjoin
public streets, a two-step process is required. The first is known as a sight
distance requirement. The second is known as a clear vision requirement.
All drives must pass these requirements to gain permit approval. These
requirements are explained in detail as follows:
Sight distance is determined by looking in each direction from the driveway
centerline with an eye height of 3 1/2 feet and never losing sight of an
object at the height of 4 1/4 feet for a specified distance. These distances
are determined according to the posted regulatory speed limit (see figure
1). All measurements shall be taken from existing roadway surface.
Clear vision is determined by looking in each direction from the driveway
centerline with an eye height of 3 1/2 feet above road surface, 10 feet from
edge of traveled street on gravels, and 15 feet on paved roads, for a specific
distance. All obstructions within this area shall be removed. Permission
to remove obstructions, including trees, on adjoining property must be
obtained by applicant from the property owner. Applicant must maintain
clear vision area in perpetuity.

obstructions. Said warning notice may be either presented to the
occupant of the premises or posted on the premises. The cost of
removal shall be assessed against the owner of the property.
(c) Clearing by City upon failure of owner to comply. If any person shall fail
to comply with the provisions of Subsection (b) by the specified time,
the Superintendent of Public Works shall, cause all such dirt, debris or
other obstructions to be removed from culverts and storm sewer catch
basins of the person not complying with the provisions of this article.
The Superintendent of Public Works shall keep an accurate account of

amended 7-12-2004 by Ord. No. 04-02]
If the Council shall have passed the resolution provided for in § 70-82, a
copy of such resolution shall be sent by first class mail to abutting owners
of the property along which the walk is to be constructed, repaired or
reconstructed, together with a notice addressed to the owners of such
property with estimated property owner cost. City Council may allow an
abutting property owner to construct, repair or reconstruct such sidewalk
in compliance with said resolution, however, such property owner shall
have only 15 days from the day of mailing such resolution to respond with
his intent to construct, repair or reconstruct such sidewalk in compliance
with said resolution and City specifications and sign an agreement as
well as obtain any necessary permits with the City stating such. Failure
of any property owner to respond within the 15 days forfeits their right
to construct, repair, or reconstruct such sidewalk. Any property owner
signing an agreement to construct, repair, or reconstruct their sidewalk
must complete such project within 45 days after the initial fifteen-day
notice. Failure to complete their sidewalk project within the 45 days
(1) The expense and cost of constructing, repairing or reconstructing all
such sidewalks in single-family residential districts and occupied singlefamily
residential homes in any other district shall be paid for in the
following manner: The City shall pay 1/2 of the costs of four-foot width
sidewalk in addition to any additional width costs and the person
owning the property along the margin of which the sidewalk shall be
constructed shall pay the other 1/2 of the four-foot width cost.
(2) The expense and cost of constructing, repairing or reconstructing all
such sidewalks in other than single-family residential districts shall be
paid for in the following manner: The person owning the property along
the margin of which the sidewalk shall be constructed shall pay the
entire cost.
(3) The expense and cost of constructing, repairing or reconstructing all
such sidewalks in any districts across any twenty-foot alley right-of-way
shall be paid for in the following manner: The City shall pay the entire
cost.
§ 70-81 CORUNNA CODE § 70-83
1:346
terminates all property owners' rights on such project and warrants the
City to complete such project and assess all costs incurred by the City
in completing such project for the property owner. Any property owner
who wishes to construct, repair, or reconstruct the sidewalk adjacent to
his property in the City must obtain the proper permits from the building
official to do so and is responsible for 100% of the cost involved in such
project unless City Council agrees to a shared cost of the project upon a
request from the property owner. The Council may provide for the payment
of sidewalk costs in annual installments. Such annual installments shall not
exceed five in number, the first installment being due 60 days from date of
invoice upon completion of construction with deferred installments being
due annually thereafter or, in the discretion of the Council, may be spread
upon and made a part of each annual City tax roll thereafter until all are
paid. Interest shall be charged on all deferred installments at a rate not to
exceed 7% per annum, commencing on the due date of the first installment
and payable on the due date of each subsequent installment; the full amount
of all or any deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon to the date
of payment, may be paid in advance of the due dates thereof.
Should any installment remain unpaid when due, the full remaining
obligation shall be considered as delinquent and a 4% penalty shall be
collected on such unpaid obligation. Deferred installments shall be collected
without penalty until 60 days after the due date, after which time such
installments shall be considered as delinquent and the penalties on the
installments shall be collected as are provided in the Charter to be collected
on delinquent general City taxes. After the completion of construction, the
City Treasurer shall notify by mail each property owner on the roll that
the roll has been filed, stating the amount owed and the terms of payment.
Failure on the part of the City Treasurer to give the notice or of such owner
to receive the notice shall not invalidate any obligation to the City, nor
excuse the payment of interest or penalties.
§ 70-84. Service of notice. [Code 1979, § 4.69; amended 7-12-2004
by Ord. No. 04-02]
The notice and resolution provided for in this article shall be mailed by first
class mail to the property owner as listed on the latest tax roll of the City.

the law enforcement agency investigating the accident, and that
agency shall forward the results to the department of state police.
(g) The department of state police shall promulgate uniform rules
under the administrative procedures act, Act No. 306 of the Public
Acts of Michigan of 1969 (MCL 24.201 et seq., MSA 3.560(101)
et seq.), as amended, for the administration of chemical tests for
the purposes of this section. An instrument used for a preliminary
chemical breath analysis may be used for a chemical test
described in this subsection if approved pursuant to rules
promulgated by the department of state police.
(7) Introduction of other competent evidence on issue of intoxication not
precluded. The provisions of Subsection (6) of this section relating to
chemical testing do not limit the introduction of any other competent
evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not a person was
impaired by or under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a
controlled substance or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a
controlled substance or whether the person had an alcohol content of
0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 milliliters of
breath or per 67 milliliters of urine, or if the person is less than 21
years of age whether the person had any bodily alcohol content within
his body. As used in this section, the expression "any bodily alcohol
content" means either of the following:
(a) An alcohol content of not less than 0.02 grams or more than 0.07
grams per 100 milliliters of blood, per 210 milliliters of breath, or
per 67 milliliters of urine.
§ 74-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 74-58
1:375
(b) Any presence of alcohol within a person's body resulting from
the consumption of intoxicating liquor, other than consumption of
intoxicating liquor as a part of a generally recognized religious
service or ceremony.
(8) Offender entitled to copy of test results upon written request; failure
of prosecution to furnish as bar to admissibility into evidence. If
a chemical test described in Subsection (6) of this section is
administered, the test results shall be made available to the person
charged or the person's attorney, upon written request to the
prosecution, with a copy of the request filed with the court. The
prosecution shall furnish the results at least two days before the day
of the trial. The prosecution shall offer the test results as evidenced in
that trial. Failure to fully comply with the request bars the admission
of the results into evidence by the prosecution.
(9) Presumptions. Except in a prosecution relating solely to a violation of
Section 5.15(1)(b) or (4) the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood,
breath or urine at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis
of the person's blood, breath or urine gives rise to the following
presumptions:
(a) If there were at the time 0.07 grams or less of alcohol per 100
milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 milliliters of the
defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine, it
is presumed that the defendant's ability to operate a motor vehicle
was not impaired due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor
and that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating
liquor.
(b) If there were at the time more than 0.07 grams but less than 0.10
grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the defendant's blood, per
210 milliliters of the defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of the
defendant's urine, it is presumed that the defendant's ability to
operate a vehicle was impaired within the provisions of section
5.15(3) due to the consumption of intoxicating liquor.
(c) If there were at the time 0.10 grams or more of alcohol per
100 milliliters of the defendant's blood, per 210 milliliters of the
defendant's breath or per 67 milliliters of the defendant's urine,
it is presumed that the defendant was under the influence of
intoxicating liquor.
(10) Jury instruction as to effect of refusal to take test. A person's refusal to
submit to a chemical test as provided in Subsection (6) is admissible in
a criminal prosecution for a crime described in Section 5.15c(1) only
to show that a test was offered to the defendant, but not as evidence
in determining the defendant's innocence or guilt. The jury shall be
instructed accordingly.
§ 74-58 CORUNNA CODE § 74-58
1:376
Sec. 5.15b. Arraignment; pretrial conference advising accused;

complaint or warrant not more than 14 days after the arrest for the
violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued, not more than 14
days after the issued or reissued arrest warrant is served, whichever is
later. The court shall not dismiss a case or impose any other sanction
for a failure to comply with this time limit. The time limit does not
apply to a violation of Section 5.15(1), (3) or (4) or Section 5.15m
joined with a felony charge.
(2) Scheduling of pretrial conference; mandatory attendance by
defendant; acceptance of plea; not more than one adjournment; final
adjudication time limit. The court shall schedule a pretrial conference
between the prosecuting attorney, the defendant and the defendant's
attorney in each case in which the defendant is charged with a
misdemeanor violation of Section 5.15(1), (3) or (4) or 5.15m. The
pretrial conference shall be held not more than 35 days after the
person's arrest for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or
reissued, not more than 35 days after the issued or reissued arrest
warrant is served, whichever is later. If the court has only one judge
who sits in more than one location in that district, the pretrial
conference shall be held not more than 42 days after the person's
arrest for the violation or, if an arrest warrant is issued or reissued,
not more than 42 days after the date the issued or reissued arrest
warrant is served, whichever is later. The court shall not dismiss a
case or impose any other sanction for a failure to comply with the
applicable time limit. The thirty-five- and forty-two-day time limits do
not apply to a violation of Section 5.15(1), (3) or (4) or 5.15m joined
with a felony charge. The court shall order the defendant to attend
the pretrial conference and may accept a plea by the defendant at
the conclusion of the pretrial conference. The court may adjourn the
pretrial conference upon the motion of a party for good cause shown.
Not more than one adjournment shall be granted to a party, and the
length of an adjournment shall not exceed 14 days.
§ 74-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 74-58
1:377
(3) Delays; adjudication. Except for delay attributable to the unavailability
of the defendant, a witness or material evidence or due to an
interlocutory appeal or exceptional circumstances, but not a delay
caused by docket congestion, the court shall finally adjudicate by a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere, entry of a verdict or other final
disposition, a case in which the defendant is charged with a
misdemeanor violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4), or 5.15m, within
77 days after the person is arrested for the violation or, if an arrest
warrant is issued or reissued, not more than 77 days after the date
the issued or reissued arrest warrant is served, whichever is later. The
court shall not dismiss a case or impose any other sanction for a failure
to comply with this time limit. The seventy-seven-day time limit does
not apply to a violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4) or Section 5.15m
joined with a felony charge.
(4) Advisement of maximum penalty prior to acceptance of plea. Before
accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere under Section 5.15,
the court shall advise the accused of the maximum possible term of
imprisonment and the maximum possible fine that may be imposed
for the violation and shall advise the defendant that the maximum
possible license sanctions that may be imposed will be based upon the
master driving record maintained by the secretary of state pursuant to
Section 204a of the act (MCL 257.204a, MSA 9.1904(1)), as amended.
(5) Screening and assessment as to alcohol or drug abuse; rehabilitative
services. Before imposing sentence, other than court-ordered license
sanctions, for a violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4), the court shall
order the person to undergo screening and assessment by a person
or agency designated by the office of substance abuse services, to
determine whether the person is likely to benefit from rehabilitative
services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug
treatment programs. As part of the sentence, the court may order
the person to participate in and successfully complete one or more
appropriate rehabilitative programs. The person shall pay for the costs
of the screening, assessment and rehabilitative services.
(6) Consideration of prior convictions; imposition of licensing sanctions;
restricted license. Immediately upon acceptance by the court of a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere or upon entry of a verdict of guilty for a
violation of Section 5.15(1), (3), or (4), whether or not the person is
eligible to be sentenced as a multiple offender, the court shall consider
all prior convictions currently entered upon the person's state driving
record, except convictions the court determines upon the defendant's
motion to be constitutionally invalid, and shall impose the following
licensing sanctions:

The City finds that a significant number of traffic arrests and traffic
accidents in the City involve drivers who were operating a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcoholic beverages and/or controlled
substances. In addition, the City finds that in traffic accidents involving
drivers who were operating a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcoholic beverages and/or controlled substances there is a greater
likelihood of personal injury and property damage. As a result of these
determinations, a greater operational and financial burden is placed upon
the City's police, fire-fighting and rescue services by persons who are
operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages
and/or controlled substances.
§ 74-182. Definitions. [Amended 8-18-1997 by Ord. No. 97-09]

CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE — Whenever the term "controlled substance"
is used in this article, it shall have the same meaning given to it under
Article 7 of the Michigan Public Health Code, MCL 333.1101 et seq., as
amended.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE — Whenever the term "emergency response" is
used in this article, it shall mean:
The providing, sending and/or utilizing of public service, police,
firefighting, and/or rescue services by the City for an accident involving
a motor vehicle where one or more of the drivers were operating the
motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor or any
controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic liquor
and any controlled substance; or

The making of a traffic stop and arrest by a police officer when the
driver was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an
alcoholic liquor or any controlled substance.

Any person who, while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor or any
controlled substance or the combined influence of an alcoholic liquor and
any controlled substance, operates a motor vehicle, which results in an
emergency response as defined in this article, shall be responsible and/or
liable for a charge in the amount as set forth in Chapter 38 of the City Code.
Only one charge shall be incurred by a person liable for a charge under this
ordinance for an emergency response, regardless of how many departments

or reduce any criminal liability or responsibility, including fines imposed
by a judge under the Michigan Vehicle Code on a driver for operating a

influence of an alcoholic liquor or controlled substance, or the
combined influence of an alcoholic liquor and any controlled substance,
when his or her physical or mental abilities are impaired to a degree
that he or she no longer has the ability to operate a motor vehicle with
the caution characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence.
Further, it shall be presumed that a person was operating a motor
vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic liquor if a chemical
analysis of his or her blood, urine or breath indicates that the amount of
alcohol in his or her blood was in excess of seven one-hundredths of 1%.
(b) Charge against person. The expenses incurred by the City as a result of
an emergency response shall be charged to the person liable for the
expenses under the terms of this article. The charge constitutes a debt

an emergency response submit a bill for the costs by first class mail or
personal service to the person liable for the amount of the charge as
enumerated in this article, as amended. The bill(s) shall require full
payment in 30 days from the date of service.
(d) Failure to pay; procedure to recover costs. Any failure by the person
described in this article as liable for the expense of an emergency
response, to pay the bill within 30 days of service shall be considered in

the expenses and any costs allowed by law.

RCRA hazardous wastes. [Code 1979, § 2.62; amended 7-5-1994 by
Ord. No. 94-07]
(f) Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in
the case of a new source, following commencement of discharge from
the regulated process, any user subject to categorical pretreatment
standards shall submit to the public services director a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by such
standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process
units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment
standards or requirements. Such reporting shall conform to the
requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b)(4) through (6). Where equivalent
mass or concentration limits are established by the public services
director for a user, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user's long-term production rate. Where a user is subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production, the report shall include the user's
actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The report
shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by
an authorized representative of the industrial user, and certified to by a
qualified professional.
(g) Periodic compliance reports. Any user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard shall be required to submit periodic compliance
reports to the public services director unless all the information
required for the report is obtained by the City. Periodic compliance
reports by the user shall conform to the requirements of 40 CFR 403.12
as set forth in an order of determination to the user by the public
services director.
(h) Signatory requirements for reports. The reports required by
Subsections (e), (f) and (g) above shall include the certification
statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii), and shall be signed by
an authorized representative of the user.
(a) Limited discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged the following described substances, materials, waters or
wastes except as authorized by an order of determination as issued by
the public services director. The following numerical limitations were
based upon technical analysis of NPDES permit requirements,
industrial loadings, sludge management practices and treatment
process tolerance and efficiency as in place at the time of ordinance
adoption and are intended to meet the objectives given in § 78-106. The
technical support documentation for numerical limitations is on file as a
§ 78-109 CORUNNA CODE § 78-110
1:450
part of the City's industrial pretreatment program. The director may set
limitations lower than the limitations established below if in his review
changing factors in the technical support documentation necessitate
more stringent limitations in order to meet the objectives given in
§ 78-106. The director may establish numerical limitations for
substances not specifically limited below in order to meet the objectives
of § 78-106. The director may set, by an order of determination for
individual discharges, alternative or additional mass limitations,
provided adequate provision for flow metering and sampling are
provided by the discharger. [Amended 2-8-2016 by Ord. No.
2016-01]
(1) These limitations shall be daily maximum limitations. Compliance
or noncompliance may be determined by analysis of: twenty-fourhour
flow proportioned samples, twenty-four-hour composite
samples, or one or more grab samples averaged over a twenty-fourhour
period as determined to be appropriate by the public services
director for the discharge and parameters to be measured. No
discharge to the City's wastewater system shall exceed the
following limitations unless so authorized in an order of
determination for the public services director which sets
alternative mass limitations for the specific parameter:
1.0 mg/l Arsenic
0.1 mg/l Cadmium
2.7 mg/l Chromium (total)
2.0 mg/l Copper
0.6 mg/l Lead
1.0 mg/l Nickel
4.5 mg/l Zinc
0.0002 mg/l Mercury
0.07 mg/l Selenium
1.0 mg/l Silver
0.56 mg/l Cyanide (free)
1.0 mg/l Trichloroethylene
No detectable discharge PCB's (total)
(2) Specific limitations on compatible pollutants.
a. These limitations shall be daily maximum limitations.
Compliance or noncompliance is to be based on twenty-fourhour
composite samples. No discharge to the City's
wastewater system shall exceed the following limitations
unless so authorized in an order of determination by the public
services director pursuant to Subsection (a)(2)b of this section:
§ 78-110 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 78-110
1:451
500 mg/l BOD-5 (or CBOD-5)
1,000 mg/l Suspended solids
100 mg/l Total phosphorous
100 mg/l Ammonia
b. The public services director may specify alternate mass and/or
concentration limits for compatible pollutants for individual
industrial users through issuance of an order of determination.
Such alternate limitations shall be based on plant treatment
capacity available for the user, treatability of the wastewater
and determination that such discharges will not cause
interference with the wastewater system. Such alternate
limitations are subject to revocation or modification by the
public services director due to changing conditions.
(3) Any waters or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, petroleum oil,
cutting oil or other oils, whether emulsified or not, in excess of 100
mg/l; or containing substances which may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between 32 and 150° F.
(4) Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150° F. (66°
C.).
(5) Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- and odorproducing
substances in such concentrations exceeding limits
which may be established by the public services director to meet
the objects of § 78-106.
(6) Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5 unless
specifically authorized in an order of determination issued by the
public services director. The public services director may allow a
higher discharger pH, not to exceed 11.0, upon determining that
such discharge will not cause corrosion or interfere with the
operation of the wastewater system.
(7) Any waters or wastes which contain unusual concentrations of
dissolved solids.
(8) Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment process
employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that
the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the
requirements of its NPDES permit of which may interfere with the
sludge management practices.
(9) Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable
pretreatment standard or order of determination by the public
services director, no industrial user shall increase the use of
process water or dilute a discharge as a substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with any pretreatment standard.
§ 78-110 CORUNNA CODE § 78-110
1:452
(b) Pretreatment requirements.
(1) User shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment or control
measures as required to comply with the most stringent
requirements of federal categorical pretreatment standards, state
law and regulations or the requirements of this article or orders of
determination issued pursuant to § 78-119. All facilities required to
pretreat or control wastewater discharges shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the user's expense.
(2) Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the public services director for
review and approval prior to the construction of the facility. The
review and approval of the plans and operating procedures does
not relieve the user from complying with applicable standards and
requirements. Any subsequent change in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to the public
services director prior to the user initiating such change.
(c) Bypass.
(1) Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not violate pretreatment standards or requirements,
but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to Subsections (2), (3)
and (4) below.
(2) Notice. An industrial user shall provide notice of bypass as follows:
a. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the public services director, if
possible at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.
b. An industrial user shall orally notify the public services
director or the wastewater treatment plant operator of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements immediately upon becoming aware
of the bypass. Unless specifically waived by the public services
director, a written submission shall also be provided within five
days of becoming aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact times and dates, and if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass.
(3) Prohibition of bypass. Bypasses are prohibited and the industrial
user is subject to enforcement action for a bypass, unless:
a. The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
§ 78-110 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 78-110
1:453
b. There are no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as use of
auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment
should have been installed to prevent bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative
maintenance; and
c. The industrial user submitted notices as required by
Subsection (c)(2) of this section.
(4) The public services director may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, upon determining that it will
meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (c)(3) of this section.
(d) RCRA hazardous wastes.
(1) Section 78-108(13) prohibits the discharge to the wastewater
system of any wastes which are listed hazardous wastes in 40 CFR
261.30-33 pursuant to § 3001 of the Federal Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA). The discharge to the wastewater system
of certain wastes which, if otherwise disposed of, would be
characteristic hazardous wastes under 40 CFR 261, may be
permissible if the discharge otherwise complies with all applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements, federal and state law.
(2) Notification requirements. Any industrial user discharging or
proposing to discharge a waste, which if otherwise disposed of
would be a characteristic hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261, shall
notify the public services director in writing of such discharge or
proposed discharge. Such reporting shall be by completion and
submittal of a form provided by the public services director or
otherwise meeting the information requirements of 40 CFR
403.12(p). Initial reporting shall be no later than 90 days following
July 8, 1994. Users who have provided the initial notification prior
to July 5, 1994, need not resubmit such information unless there
has been a change in the discharge or information reported.
Industrial users not reporting any such discharge may be required
by the public services director to submit a statement, signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user, certifying that the
user does not discharge listed or characteristic hazardous wastes
as identified pursuant to 40 CFR 261. Any industrial user shall
notify the public services director in advance of any new or
increased discharge of a characteristic hazardous waste.
(3) The public services director shall review the information reported
by the user and shall make such determinations as authorized by
§ 78-119 relative to the discharge of the waste to the City
wastewater system.

If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged
to the sewage works, which waters contain the substances or possess the
characteristics enumerated in §§ 78-108, 78-109, or 78-110, or which in the
judgment of the director may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater
treatment facilities, processes, equipment, sludge management practice or
receiving water, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, or which are discharged or proposed to be discharged by
an industry subject to categorical pretreatment standards, the director may:
(1) Reject the wastes.
(2) Require pretreatment to meet categorical standards or local limits
contained in this division or as established by the director, whichever is
more restrictive.
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
(4) Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes and sewer charges, under the
provisions of § 78-114.
(5) Require the installation and maintenance of a control manhole or other
monitoring facility together with such meters and other appurtenances
necessary for the observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastewater discharge. Such manhole or monitoring facility and
equipment shall be installed by the owner, at his expense, in accordance
with plans and specifications approved by the director. Such manhole or
monitoring facility shall be maintained by the owner in proper
operating condition and safely accessible at all times. The director, or
his authorized representative, shall have access to the control manhole
or monitoring facility at any time for the purpose of observing, sampling
and measuring the wastewater discharge or inspecting the monitoring
equipment used by the discharger.
(6) If the director permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows,
the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the director and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided for any
waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
(7) Require that grease, oil and sand interceptors be provided when, in his
opinion, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand
or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors
shall be of a type and capacity approved by the director and shall be

7-5-1994 by Ord. No. 94-07]
All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be determined in
accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments
thereto (Measurements and Tests) or, if 40 CFR 136 does not contain
sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant or waste characteristic
in question, in accordance with procedures approved by EPA or as found in
Standard Methods and approved by the public services director. Sampling
methods, times, duration and frequencies are to be determined on an
individual basis subject to the approval of the public services director.
§ 78-113. Flow measurement. [Code 1979, § 2.65]
The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste loadings, sewer use
charges and surcharges shall be metered water consumption of the person
as shown in records of water meter readings maintained by the City water
department except as otherwise provided below:
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors the owner shall
be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate
means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates,
and means of disposal which are subject to review by the director.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by
the owner's personnel must be performed by properly licensed waste
disposal firms.
(1) If a person discharging into the City sanitary sewers procures any part
or all of his water from sources other than the City water system, all or
a part of which is discharged into the sanitary sewers, the person shall
install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved by
the director for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these other sources.
(2) If a person discharging industrial waste into the sanitary sewers
produces evidence satisfactory to the director that more than 10% of
the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach
the sanitary sewer, then the determination of the water consumption to
be used in computing the waste volume discharged into the sanitary
sewer may be made a matter of agreement between the City and the
person.
(3) If the director determines the volume of waste discharged cannot be
adequately determined using metered water consumption records or
that direct measurement of industrial wastewater discharges is
necessary to identify and control slug loadings, he may require an
industrial user to provide direct measurement of the wastewater
discharge. Metering devices so required shall be installed in
accordance with the requirements of § 78-111(5).

§ 78-114. Extra strength surcharge. [Code 1979, § 2.66]
Users approved by the director for the discharge of a wastewater greater
in strength than normal strength domestic wastewater will be subject to an
extra strength surcharge. The extra strength surcharge will be computed
from loadings based on 24 hours' composite samples and rates established
by resolution of the City Council under Article VI of this chapter.
§ 78-115. Spill prevention plan. [Code 1979, § 2.67]
Any nondomestic user storing, utilizing or producing any toxic or hazardous
materials which, as determined by the director or his appointed
representative, have the potential for accidental discharge of slug loading to
the sewage works may be required to develop and submit a spill prevention
plan. The plan as a minimum shall contain:
§ 78-116. Spill prevention facilities. [Code 1979, § 2.68]
Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
materials or substances prohibited or regulated by this division. When
in the opinion of the director an accidental spill or leakage of toxic or
hazardous materials to the sewage works could result in a threat to the
public health and safety, or cause interference with the sewage works,
or pass through the sewage works to potentially impact the receiving
waters, the director may require that the user install and implement such
containment facilities and practices as necessary to prevent such accidental
discharge. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the director for review and
approval prior to their construction and implementation.
§ 78-117. Notification requirements. [Code 1979, § 2.69; amended
7-5-1994 by Ord. No. 94-07]
(1) Identification of the type and volume of toxic or hazardous materials
stored, handled or produced.

(3) Any corrective actions taken by the user.
(c) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of a
pretreatment standard, the user shall notify the public services director
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the public services director within 30 days after becoming
aware of the violation.
(d) Any industrial user shall promptly notify the public services director in
advance of:
(1) The discharge of any toxic or hazardous pollutant not previously
reported.
(2) Any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous
wastes for which the industrial user has submitted initial
notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(e) Such notification shall not relieve the user of any enforcement action,
fines, penalties, damages or liability which may be imposed pursuant to
this Code or state or federal law. Proper notification, however, shall be
considered by the public services director in determining the
appropriate enforcement action for a violation.
(a) The public services director shall assign users of the City wastewater
system to one of the following classes:

The utility department is hereby authorized to enforce the payment of
charges for water service to any premises by discontinuing the water
service to the premises and the payment of charges for sewage disposal
service to any premises may be enforced by discontinuing either the water
service to the premises, and litigation may be instituted by the City against
the customer. The charges for water service and sewage disposal service,
which, under the provisions of Act No. 94 of the Public Acts of Michigan of
1933 (MCL 141.101 et seq.), as amended, are made a lien on the premises
to which furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien; and the
Clerk/Treasurer shall, semiannually, certify all unpaid delinquent charges
for such services furnished to any premises, to the City assessor who shall
place them on the next tax roll of the City. Such charges so assessed shall
be collected in the same manner as general City taxes. Where the water
service to any premises is turned off to enforce the payment of water service
charges or sewage disposal service charges, the water service shall not be
recommenced until all delinquent charges have been paid in full, and there
shall be a water turn-off charge as specified in the fee schedule.20
(a) Billing for water and sewer shall be made on a quarterly basis and shall
be sent by the 20th of the following month after the quarter. The billings
shall be paid, in full by the due date posted on the utility bill. Ten
percent of each bill shall be added thereto on each bill which is not paid
before the due date posted. Failure to receive a utility bill shall not be
grounds for avoiding the 10% additional charge.
(b) In such instances that the meters cannot be read or are working
improperly, the utility billing clerk shall do an estimate based on the
customers' history to calculate the current bill. Once the meter is able
to be properly read or replaced, an appropriate adjustment reflecting
the actual read will be billed on the next quarterly billing.
20.Editor's Note: It should be noted that the fee schedule is not set out at length herein but
is on file and available for inspection in the office of the City Clerk.

provisions of this chapter shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any
other law or ordinance impose more stringent requirements than are
imposed or required by this chapter, then the provisions of such law or
ordinance shall govern.
§ 86-332. Building regulations. [Amended 6-6-1994 by Ord. No.
94-06; 11-19-2007 by Ord. No. 07-03]
(a) Scope. No building or structure, or part thereof, shall hereafter be

no lot or land, or part thereof, shall hereafter be used or maintained and
no new use made of any building, structure or land, or part thereof,
except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
(b) Unlawful building. In case any building, or part thereof, is used,
erected, occupied or altered contrary to law or the provisions of this
chapter, such building shall be deemed an unlawful structure and a
nuisance and may be required to be vacated, torn down or abated by
any legal means, and shall not be used or occupied until it has been
made to conform to the provisions of this chapter. Public expenditures
toward abating such nuisance shall become a lien upon the land.

District, provided that adequate interior vehicular circulation to ensure
public safety, and that appropriate access can be assured in a site plan
submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission.
(a) Building appearance in residential zones. In residential zones, after
25% of the lots and frontage on the side of the street on any block
where the proposed improvement is contemplated have been improved
by the erection on the residences thereon, if 1/2 or more of the
residences built in any such block are of a certain type and style, the
remainder of the residences built in any such block and to be
constructed, altered, relocated or repaired in such block shall be of a
substantially similar type and style so that new or altered buildings will
be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood. Nothing in this
subsection shall prevent the upgrading of any residential block by
installing an exterior finish having fire or weather resistance which is
greater than the minimum required in this chapter, or by constructing
in such block a residence having a floor area greater than the average
area of residences in such block; provided, however, that such type and
style shall be such as not to impair or destroy property values in the
block.

face brick or other ornamental materials approved by the Planning
Commission consistent with neighboring property, and no building so
situated shall be constructed of tarred paper, tin, corrugated iron, or
any form of pressed board or felt or similar material within the limits
specified in this subsection, nor shall any occupant of such premises be
permitted to place open stock, scrap or junk piles within the 200 feet
unless such materials shall be obscured from view from the street by
the existence of a building, solid wall, earth berm or evergreen screen
sufficient to properly obscure the materials from view from the street.
(c) Building completion period. All structures shall be completed within
one year of the date of issuance of the building permit for such
structure, unless an extension for not more than one additional year is
granted for good cause by the building inspector. When a part of the
building is ready for occupancy, a temporary occupancy permit may be
issued, provided that the premises comply with health and fire
standards required under this chapter or any other ordinance,
regulation or statute.
(d) Personal construction authority. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting an owner, tenant, occupant or land contract
vendee from doing his own building, altering, plumbing, electrical

installations, etc., provided the minimum requirements of the electrical
and plumbing codes of the state and the applicable county health
department regulations are complied with.
(a) Intent.
(1) It is the intent of this chapter to permit existing legal
nonconforming lots, structures or uses to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival.
(2) It is recognized that there exist, within the districts established by
this chapter and subsequent amendments, lots, structures, and
uses of land and structures which were lawful before June 10,
1994, which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the
terms of this chapter or future amendments.
(3) Such uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of
this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon,
expanded or extended, or be used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(4) A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land,
or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be
extended or enlarged after the date of passage of the ordinance
from which this chapter is derived by attachment on a building or
premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the
premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
be prohibited generally in the district involved.
(5) To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of
any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior
to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is
derived or the effective date of an amendment to this chapter, and
upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried
on. For purposes of this subsection, actual construction is defined
to include the placing of construction materials in a permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that, where
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially
begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the building involved.
(b) Nonconforming lots. In any single-family district, notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any
single lot of record which is under separate and distinct ownership from
§ 86-333 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-334
1:581
adjacent lots at the effective date of the ordinance from which this
chapter is derived or the effective date of an amendment to this chapter.
This subsection shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable
in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements
not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard
requirement variances may be obtained through approval of the Board
of Appeals.
(c) Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the effective date of the
ordinance from which this chapter is derived or the effective date of an
amendment to this chapter, lawful use of land exists that is made no
longer permissible under the terms of this chapter as enacted or
amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, or
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived
or the effective date of an amendment to this chapter.
(2) No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived
or the effective date of an amendment to this chapter.
(3) If such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a
period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for this district
in which such land is located.
(d) Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or the
effective date of an amendment to this chapter that could not be built
under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity. For example, existing residences on
lots of a width less than required in this chapter may add a rear
porch provided that other requirements relative to yard space and
land coverage are met.
(2) Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of
more than 50% of its replacement cost, exclusive of the foundation,
at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 86-334 CORUNNA CODE § 86-334
1:582
(3) Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for this
district in which it is located after it is removed.
(e) Nonconforming uses of structures and land. If a lawful use of a
structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the
effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived or the
effective date of an amendment to this chapter that would not be
allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use
may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
following provisions:
(1) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this
chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged,
extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally
altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use
permitted in the district in which it is located.
(2) Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use,
and which existed at the effective date of the ordinance from which
this chapter is derived or the effective date of an amendment to this
chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land
outside such building.
(3) If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and land in combination, may be changed to
another nonconforming use of the same or a more restricted
classification; provided that the Zoning Board of Appeals, either by
general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find
that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to
the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting
such change, the Board of Appeals may require conditions and
safeguards in accord with the purpose and intent of this chapter.
Where a nonconforming use of a structure, land, or structure and
land in combination is hereafter changed to a more conforming use,
it shall not thereafter be changed to a less conforming use.
(4) Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such
structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed.
(5) When a nonconforming use of structure, or structure and premises
in combination, is discontinued or ceases to exist for one year
during any three-year period, the structure, or structure and
premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in
conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is
located. Structures occupied by seasonal uses (one season out of
each year) shall be excepted from this subsection.

§ 86-335. Adaptive reuse projects. [Amended 6-6-1994 by Ord. No.
94-06; 10-7-2019 by Ord. No. 19-04]
(6) Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and
premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure
shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
(f) Repairs and maintenance.
(1) On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming
use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on
ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls,
fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 50% of the
assessed value of the building, provided that the cubic content of
the building as it existed at the effective date of the ordinance from
which this chapter is derived or the effective date of an amendment
to this chapter shall not be increased.
(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or
part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with
protecting the public safety, upon order of such official.
(g) Conditional uses. Any conditional use as provided for in this chapter
shall not be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall, without further
action, be deemed a conforming use in such district.
(h) Change of tenancy or ownership. There may be a change of tenancy,
ownership or management of any existing nonconforming uses of land,
structures and premises, provided there is no change in the nature or
character of such nonconforming uses.
(i) Acquisition by City. The City Council may acquire, by purchase,
condemnation or otherwise, private property or an interest in private
property for the removal of nonconforming uses. The cost and expense,
or a portion thereof, of acquiring the private property may be paid from
general funds or assessed to a special district in accordance with the
applicable statutory provisions relating to the creation and operation of
special assessment districts for public improvements in cities. The
elimination of the nonconforming uses and structures in a zoning
district is declared to be for a public purpose and for a public use. The
City Council may institute and prosecute proceedings for condemnation
of nonconforming uses and structures under the power of eminent
domain in accordance with Act No. 149 of the Public Acts of Michigan of
1911 (MCL 213.21 et seq., MSA 8.11 et seq.), as amended, or other
applicable statute.
(a) Intent.
(1) Typically, various land use activities are provided for in one or more
zoning districts. The criteria for such allocations are based upon
similarities in the nature of uses and their relationship to other
§ 86-334 CORUNNA CODE § 86-335
1:584
such uses and adjoining development. Zoning districts are also
established to coordinate with and provide for the effectuation of
the City's long range development plan.
(2) The City does, however, possess various existing specialized
structures which have become functionally obsolete for their
original purpose, or are nonconforming, and whose redevelopment
or conversion in conformance with the City comprehensive
development plan would be unnecessarily burdensome. It is,
therefore, the intent of this section to set forth the basic qualifying
criteria, project classification, development standards and
submittal requirements necessary to provide for the adaptive reuse
of eligible properties within the City to support the local economic
and employment base without adversely affecting the public health,
safety and welfare of the City as a whole.
(b) Qualifying criteria.
(1) The City Council shall approve the adaptive reuse of buildings and
uses. In qualifying a site for adaptive reuse, the City Council shall
find the following conditions to exist:
a. The subject site is zoned in compliance with the City's
comprehensive development plan;
b. The use can no longer be reasonably continued for its existing
purpose by reason of market conditions or operational
constraints (i.e., limited site size, floor area deficiencies,
parking or loading area, etc.);
c. Site redevelopment in accordance with local development
codes would be unnecessarily burdensome by reason of
ordinance compliance (restrictions on area, lot coverage,
height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot) or cost; and
d. The subject site has frontage on, or direct access to, an
improved major or secondary thoroughfare.
(2) The City Council may not grant adaptive reuse status to any
property whose principal structures are found to be destroyed by
any means to the extent of more than 50% of the replacement cost.
Any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations of
the zoning district in which it is located.
(c) Application; data required.
(1) Application for an adaptive reuse project as provided under the
provisions of this chapter shall be made to the City Clerk by filing
an application form, submitting required data, exhibits and
information, and depositing the required fee as established by
§ 86-335 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-335
1:585
resolution of the City Council, as amended from time to time. No
portion of such fee shall be reimbursable to the applicant.
(2) An application shall contain the following:
a. The applicant's name, address and telephone number.
b. Address and tax description number of the subject parcel.
c. A signed statement that the applicant is the owner of the
subject parcel, or is acting as the owner's representative.
d. A certified survey drawing of the subject parcel.
e. Supporting statements, evidence, data, information and
exhibits which address those qualifying criteria for assessing
special condition use permit applications outlined in
Subsection (b) of this section.
(d) Public hearing. Upon receipt of an application for an adaptive reuse
project, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing, one
notice of which shall be published not less than five and not more than
15 days prior to the public hearing date in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City and sent by first class mail to the owners of the
property for which an adaptive reuse project is being considered, to the
owners of record of all real property and to the occupants of all
structures located within 300 feet of the boundaries of the property in
question. The notice shall:
(1) Describe the nature of the adaptive reuse request.
(2) Adequately describe the property in question.
(3) State the date, time and place of the public hearing.
(4) Indicate when and where written comments concerning the
request will be received.
(e) Approval; project classification.
(1) Upon holding a public hearing, the Planning Commission shall
determine whether the qualifying criteria have been met as set
forth in Subsection (b) of this section. The Planning Commission
shall, within 30 days of making such determination, forward to the
City Council its finding and recommendation.
(2) The City Council, upon receipt of the finding, may table action for
purposes of further study or gaining additional information, deny
the application for adaptive reuse upon finding that the criteria
have not been met, or approve the application for adaptive reuse
upon finding that the qualifying criteria have been met.
(f) Development standards.

(1) In areas meeting the criteria set out in this section, development
standards may be modified by the Planning Commission upon
finding adequate evidence that the proposed use:
a. Will be compatibly designed, constructed and maintained with
the existing and intended character of the vicinity;
b. Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
c. Will be served adequately by essential public services and
facilities, or the agencies responsible for the establishment of
the proposed use will be able to adequately provide for such
services; and
d. Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment and conditions of operation that will be detrimental
to any persons, property or the general welfare by reason of
excessive smoke, fumes, glare, noise, vibration or odor.
(2) The Planning Commission may require such additional safeguards
as deemed necessary for the protection of the general welfare and
for ensuring individual property rights and for ensuring that the
intent and objectives of this chapter will be observed.
(g) Site plan approval.
(1) Site plan approval shall be required in accordance with § 86-391
and all applicable ordinances.
(2) The Planning Commission may, at its discretion, concurrently
review the site plan at the time of its review of qualifying criteria.
(a) The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section,
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where
the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

number of required parking spaces result in the requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction up to and including 1/2 shall be
disregarded and fractions over 1/2 shall require one parking space.
(12) Computing number of required spaces. For the purpose of computing
the number of parking spaces required, the definition of usable floor
area shall govern and be defined as that area used for or intended to be
used for the sale of merchandise or services, or for use to serve patrons,
clients or customers. Such floor area which is used or intended to be
used principally for the storage or processing of merchandise, for

issued by the building inspector. Applications for a permit shall be
submitted to the building department in such form as may be
determined by the building inspector, and shall be accompanied with
two sets of site plans for the development and construction of the
parking lot showing that the provisions of this section will be fully
complied with. The entire parking area, including parking spaces and
maneuvering lanes, required under this section shall be provided with
asphaltic or concrete surfacing in accordance with specifications
approved by the municipal engineer. Off-street parking areas shall be
drained so as to dispose of all surface water accumulated in the parking
area in such a way as to preclude drainage of water onto adjacent
property or toward buildings.
(2) Plans for the layout of off-street parking facilities shall be in accordance
with the following minimum requirements.23
(3) All maneuvering lane widths shall permit one-way traffic movement,
except that the 90° pattern shall permit two-way movement.

refuse and debris and shall be landscaped with deciduous shrubs,
evergreen material or ornamental trees. The ground area shall be
planted and kept in lawn. All such landscaping and planting shall be
maintained in a healthy, growing condition, neat and orderly in
appearance. The Planning Commission, upon application by the
property owner of the off-street parking area, may waive or modify the
wall requirement by approving either an earth berm or evergreen
screen in its place. The Planning Commission may also waive the wall
requirement in specific cases where cause can be shown that no good

Off-street parking areas shall be landscaped as follows:
purpose would be served by compliance with the requirements of this
subsection.
(8) All lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area shall be so
installed as to be confined within and directed onto the parking area
only.
(9) In all cases where a wall extends to an alley which is a means of ingress
and egress to or from an off-street parking area, it shall be permissible
to end the wall not more than 10 feet from such alley line in order to
permit a wider means of access to the parking area.
(10) Parking aisles shall not exceed 300 feet without a break in circulation.
(11) Except for those serving single- and two-family dwellings, all parking
lots shall be provided with wheel stops or bumper guards so located

shelter buildings shall conform to setback requirements for structures
in the district in which the building is located.
(1) In off-street parking areas containing 20 or more parking spaces, an
area equal to at least 5% of the total parking area shall be used for
interior landscaping. Whenever possible, parking lot landscaping shall
be arranged to improve the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic,
guide traffic movement, and improve the appearance of the parking
area, through the even distribution of the landscape effort across the
total off-street parking area, rather than concentrating all effort in one
location.
(2) Parking lot landscaping shall be not less than five feet in any single
dimension and not less than 150 square feet in any single island area.
Not more than two landscaped units of 150 square feet may be

Required parking for a development may be located off-site under certain
circumstances. Requests for off-site parking must meet the following
requirements:
§ 86-341. Special parking districts; payment in lieu of provision of
required parking and loading space. [Amended 6-6-1994 by Ord.
No. 94-06]
The provisions and requirements as set forth in §§ 86-337 and 86-340
shall apply to all areas within the City except as modified by this section.
The City recognizes that special provisions should be considered for the
downtown area including the reduction of required parking spaces due to
the availability of public parking. To this end:
(1) Residential uses. Parking facilities accessory to dwelling units shall be
located on the same zoning lot as the use served. Spaces accessory to
uses other than dwellings (such as churches) may be located on a lot
adjacent to or directly across a street or alley from the lot occupied by
the use served, but in no case at a distance in excess of 300 feet from
such zoning lot.
(2) Nonresidential uses. Parking facilities accessory to nonresidential uses
may be located on other than the same lot as the use served (off-site).
All required parking spaces shall be within 500 feet of such zoning lot.
No parking spaces accessory to a use in a business or industrial district
shall be located in a residential district, unless authorized by the
Planning Commission.
(3) Agreement required. A written agreement shall be drawn to the
satisfaction of the City Attorney and executed by all parties concerned
ensuring the continued availability of the off-site parking facilities for
the use they are intended to serve.
(1) Portions of the City shall be contained within areas described as special
parking districts as established by the City Council with
recommendation from the Planning Commission.
(2) The boundaries of areas classified as special parking districts are
hereby established as shown on the zoning map. Where uncertainty
exists with respect to the boundaries of the special parking districts as
shown on the zoning districts map, the rules as set forth in § 86-33 shall
apply.
(3) The number of off-street parking spaces and the size of loading and
unloading areas required for any new use or expanded or intensified
use of property located within or partially within a special parking
district shall be determined as set forth in §§ 86-340 and 86-342 and as
provided for in this section.
§ 86-340 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-341
1:599
a. Off-street parking. The determination of parking needs within a
special parking district shall be based upon the following
standards. For those uses not specified an adjustment may be made
by the City Council, following Planning Commission
recommendation, when it is found that a reduction from the
standards would not adversely affect the retail, office and ancillary
service facilities forming the commercial nucleus of these older
core business areas. In this latter regard, primary consideration
shall be given to uses which are generally the object of special
purpose trips and thereby have little or no interrelation with those
business activities in the core business areas. The following
standards reflect the gross floor area actively used in day-to-day
operations and shall exclude only vacant space and storage areas.
1. Retail stores, except as
otherwise specified
1 for each 350 square feet of
gross floor area
2. Furniture and appliance
stores
1 for each 1,800 square feet of
gross floor area
3. Business and professional
offices, except as
otherwise specified
1 for each 500 square feet of
gross floor area
4. Medical and dental offices 1 for each 175 square feet of
gross floor area
5. Banks (excluding drive-in
stations)
1 for each 250 square feet of
gross floor area
6. Establishments offering
food, beverages or
refreshments for sale and
consumption on the
premises
1 for each 100 square feet of
gross floor area
7. Apartments 1 for each dwelling unit, plus 1/4
for each bedroom
b. Off-street loading. The Planning Commission shall have the right to
modify or waive the requirement for off-street loading areas as
specified in § 86-342. Any such modification or waiver shall be
based upon a review of a site plan and the surrounding area and a
determination that there is satisfactory loading space serving the
building or that the provision of such loading space is physically or
functionally impractical.
(4) The owner of the new or expanded use may make application to the City
Clerk for the option of paying a dollar amount established by resolution
of the City Council per required parking space and loading and
unloading space in lieu of providing the required spaces as per the
provisions and requirements set forth in §§ 86-337 and 86-342. These
monies would be paid into the special parking district fund established
by the City Council specifically for the purpose of constructing and

1:600
§ 86-342. Off-street loading and unloading space. [Amended
6-6-1994 by Ord. No. 94-06]
improving off-street parking areas to serve uses located within the
special parking districts. The timing of parking spaces provided and
their location shall be at the sole discretion of the City Council.
(5) The amount paid into the parking fund described in Subsection (4) of
this section shall not apply against any present or future special
assessments levied by the City for parking improvements.
(6) This exception may only be granted by the City Council. Granting of the
exception shall be based upon evidence presented by the property
owner showing that the reasonable ability to provide any or all of the
required parking spaces or loading and unloading areas, as required in
§§ 86-337 and 86-342, does not exist.
(7) A property owner granted the exception of contributing to the parking
fund will not receive an occupancy permit until the monies have been
paid into the fund in full.
(8) The provisions of this section also apply to any change in use of
property located within a special parking district that would require
parking spaces in excess of those required for the previous use.
(a) On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof
involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles or materials or
merchandise there shall be provided and maintained on the lot
adequate space for standing, loading and unloading in order to avoid
undue interference with public use of dedicated rights-of-way. Such
space shall be provided as follows:

(b) All loading spaces shall be in addition to the off-street parking area
access drive and maneuvering lane requirements.
(c) Off-street loading space shall have a clearance of 14 feet in height.
(d) Off-street loading space may be completely enclosed within a building,
or may occupy a portion of the site outside of the building, provided
that, where any portion of a loading space is open to public view, the
space shall be screened in accordance with § 86-352, pertaining to
screening walls.
(e) All loading and unloading in the industrial district shall be provided offstreet
in the rear yard or interior side yard, and shall in no instance be
permitted in a front yard. In those instances where exterior side yards
have a common relationship with an industrial district across a public
thoroughfare, loading and unloading may take place in the exterior side
yard when the setback is equal to at least 50 feet.
(a) Intent. The regulations set forth in this section are intended to prevent
the storage or accumulation of unusable, inoperable or unsightly motor
vehicles, machinery or building materials that could be hazardous to
the safety of children, encourage the propagation of rats or rodents, or
detract from the orderly appearance of the City.
(b) Restrictions.
(1) Motor vehicles. No motor vehicle shall be kept, parked or stored in
any district zoned for residential use unless the vehicle is in
operating condition and properly licensed or is kept inside a
building. However, this subsection shall not apply to any motor
vehicle ordinarily used but temporarily out of running condition for
not more than 30 continuous days within a ninety-day period. If a
motor vehicle is being kept for actual use, but is temporarily
unlicensed, the building inspector may grant the owner a period of
up to one month to procure a license.

8-1-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-01]
Home occupations shall comply with the following:
intended for use upon the premises, or old or used building
materials, shall not be kept or stored outside of a building.
However, the temporary storage of building materials intended to
be used to improve the premises may be stored outside if piled off
the ground so as not to become a suitable environment for rats or
rodents. The temporary storage of building materials to be used
for the purpose of new construction shall also be permitted. In
no case shall usable or unusable machinery, building materials or
other items be stored on a permanent basis in a truck trailer or
other type of trailer, with or without its wheels.
(a) The open parking or storage of tractors, boats or similar vehicles not
owned by the property owners or tenants of the City on lands not
specifically designated for such parking or storage shall be permitted
for a period of up to 72 hours. However, a travel trailer may be kept in
the rear or side yard of a single-family lot for a period of up to four
weeks provided a permit has first been secured from the building
inspector.
(b) Residents of the City may keep their own trailers, boats, campers,
motor homes and similar vehicles on their own property for an
indefinite period of time, provided such vehicles are in operable
condition and are not kept within five feet of the closest edge of any
neighboring road right-of-way. Such vehicles shall be subject to all
other applicable provisions concerning accessory buildings set forth in
§ 86-336.
(c) A travel trailer, motor home or camper parked or stored on a residential
lot shall not be connected to sanitary facilities and shall not be occupied
for other than recreational use for a period not to exceed four weeks
annually.
(1) No article or service shall be sold or offered for sale on the premises,
except such as is produced on the premises by such occupation.
(2) The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly
incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its
occupants, and not more than 25% of the dwelling unit (not counting
areas of unfinished attics, attached garages, breezeways, and enclosed
and unenclosed porches) shall be used for purposes of the home
occupation.
§ 86-343 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-345
1:603
(3) There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the structure or
premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home
occupation.
(4) The outdoor storage of goods and materials shall be prohibited. No
interior display shall be visible from the exterior of a dwelling unit used
for purposes of a home occupation.
(5) No more than one home occupation per dwelling unit shall be permitted
over and above the provisions pertaining to medical marijuana under
Subsections 11 and 12 of this section.

neighborhood, and any need for parking generated by the conduct of
such home occupation shall be provided by an off-street area, located
other than in a required front yard.
(7) Exterior alterations. Home occupations shall not require exterior
alterations or involve construction features not customary in dwellings
or require the use of mechanical or electrical equipment which shall
create a nuisance to the adjacent neighborhood.
(8) Interior alterations. Any permanent structural alterations to the interior
of the dwelling unit for purposes of conducting the home occupation
which would render it unsuitable for residential use shall be prohibited.
(9) Residency. The operator of the home occupation shall make the
dwelling unit within which the home occupation is conducted his/her
legal and primary place of residence, where all activities such as
sleeping, eating, entertaining and other functions and activities
normally associated with home life are conducted.
(10) Hazards or nuisances. No home occupation shall be permitted which
would increase fire and safety hazards, noise, dirt, odor, dust, gas,
glare, fumes, vibration or other nuisance elements.
(11) A medical marijuana primary caregiver, in compliance with the general
rules of the Michigan Department of Community Health, the Michigan
Medical Marihuana Act, P.A. 2008, Initiated Law MCL 333.26423(d) and
the requirements of this chapter, shall be allowed as a home occupation
subject to all the requirements of § 86-345, except Subsection (9) of this
section, Residency. Nothing in this chapter, or in any companion
regulatory provision adopted in any other provision of this Code, is
intended to grant, nor shall they be construed as granting, immunity
from criminal prosecution for growing, sale, consumption, use,
distribution, or possession of marijuana not in strict compliance with
that Act and the general rules. Also, since federal law is not affected by
that Act or the general rules, nothing in this chapter, or in any
companion regulatory provision adopted in any other provision of this
Code, is intended to grant, nor shall they be construed as granting
immunity from criminal prosecution under federal law. The Michigan
§ 86-345 CORUNNA CODE § 86-345
1:604
Medical Marihuana Act does not protect users, caregivers or the
owners of properties on which the medical use of marijuana is
occurring from federal prosecution, or from having their property
seized by federal authorities under the Federal Controlled Substances
Act. The following requirements for a registered primary caregiver
shall apply:
a. The medical use of marijuana shall comply at all times and in all
circumstances with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act and the
general rules of the Michigan Department of Community Health, as
they may be amended from time to time.
b. A registered primary caregiver must be located outside of a onethousand-
foot radius from sites where children are regularly
present, specifically: any school such as a public or private
preschool, elementary school, middle school, high school,
community college, and all other schools that have different name
references but serve students to insure community compliance
with federal "drug-free school zone" requirements. This also
includes a child care or day care facility, a church, synagogue,
mosque, or other religious temple, a community center,
recreational park or area so defined by the governing City, county
or township.
c. Not more than one registered primary caregiver shall be permitted
to service qualifying patients on a parcel or site and is prohibited
within 1,000 feet from another parcel or site at which any other
registered primary caregiver or where any other person cultivates
marijuana, or assists in the use of marijuana, not including a
patient's principal residence which is not used to cultivate
marijuana or assist in the use of medical marijuana for persons
other than the patient at such residence. Measurements for
purposes of this section shall be made from property boundary to
property boundary with contiguous parcels under the same
ownership being considered as one parcel or site.
d. Customers, clients, or patients. No more than two customers,
clients, or patients of the primary caregiver shall be on the
premises at any one time.
e. Not more than five qualifying patients shall be assisted with the
medical use of marijuana within any given calendar week.
f. All medical marijuana shall be contained within the main building
in an enclosed, locked facility inaccessible on all sides and
equipped with locks or other security devices as reviewed and
approved by the City building official and/or the City police
department with access to such facility permitted only to the
registered primary caregiver or qualifying patient. At no time shall
medical marijuana be allowed in any detached accessory buildings
or structures located upon the property.
§ 86-345 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-345
1:605
g. Licensure requirements. No cultivation, distribution, and other
assistance to patients shall be lawful in this community at a
location unless and until such location for such cultivation,
distribution, and assistance shall have obtained a license for such
location from the City. Licensure shall be subject to and in
accordance with all provisions and fees as set forth in a license
application supplied by the City. If the occupant is not the owner of
the premises then consent must be obtained from the property
owner to ensure the owner's knowledge of the use and/or
cultivation of medical marijuana on said property and submitted
along with the application.
h. All necessary building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical
permits shall be obtained for any portion of the residential
structure in which electrical wiring, lighting and/or watering
devices that support the cultivation, growing or harvesting of
marijuana are located.
i. If a room with windows is utilized as a growing location, any
lighting method that exceeds usual residential periods between the
hours of 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shall employ shielding methods,
without alteration to the exterior of the residence, to prevent
ambient light spillage that may create a distraction for adjacent
residential properties.
j. The portion of the residential structure where energy usage and
heat exceed typical residential use, such as a grow room, and the
storage of any chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, and
fertilizers shall be subject to inspection and approval by the
Corunna/Caledonia Fire Department to ensure compliance with the
Michigan Fire Protection Code.
k. The premises shall be open for inspection upon request by the
building official, the fire department and law enforcement officials
for compliance with all applicable laws and rules, without a
warrant and without delay, during the stated hours of operation/use
and at such other times as anyone is present on the premises.
(12) A medical marijuana "qualifying patient", in compliance with the
general rules of the Michigan Department of Community Health, the
Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, P.A. 2008, Initiated Law MCL
333.26423(d) and the requirements of this chapter, shall be allowed as
a home occupation subject to all the requirements of § 86-345(1)
through (10) and the requirements under this Subsection (12). Nothing
in this chapter, or in any companion regulatory provision adopted in any
other provision of this Code, is intended to grant, nor shall they be
construed as granting, immunity from criminal prosecution for

§ 86-346. Bed-and-breakfast operations. [Amended 6-6-1994 by
Ord. No. 94-06]
Any dwelling unit used for a bed-and-breakfast operation shall comply with
the following requirements:
adopted in any other provision of this Code, is intended to grant, nor
shall they be construed as granting immunity from criminal prosecution
under federal law. The Michigan Medical Marihuana Act does not
protect users, caregivers or the owners of properties on which the
medical use of marijuana is occurring from federal prosecution, or from
having their property seized by federal authorities under the Federal
Controlled Substances Act. The following requirements for a "qualifying
patient" shall apply:
a. The medical use of marijuana shall comply at all times and in all
circumstances with the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act and the
general rules of the Michigan Department of Community Health, as
they may be amended from time to time.
b. All medical marijuana shall be contained within the main building
in an enclosed, locked facility inaccessible on all sides and
equipped with locks or other security devices with access to such
facility permitted only to the "qualifying patient" and visits by City
officials deemed necessary by provisions of this chapter. At no time
shall medical marijuana be allowed in any detached accessory
buildings or structures located upon the property.
c. All necessary building, electrical, plumbing and mechanical
permits shall be obtained for any portion of the residential
structure in which electrical wiring, lighting and/or watering
devices that support the cultivation, growing or harvesting of
marijuana are located.
d. If a room with windows is utilized as a growing location, any
lighting method that exceeds usual residential periods between the
hours of 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. shall employ shielding methods,
without alteration to the exterior of the residence, to prevent
ambient light spillage that may create a distraction for adjacent
residential properties.
e. The portion of the residential structure where energy usage and
heat exceeds typical residential use, such as a grow room, and the
storage of any chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, and
fertilizers shall be subject to inspection and approval by the
Corunna/Caledonia Fire Department to ensure compliance with the
Michigan Fire Protection Code.
(1) Not more than 25% of the total floor area shall be used for bed-andbreakfast

§ 86-347. Access to major thoroughfare. [Amended 6-6-1994 by
Ord. No. 94-06; 9-16-2002 by Ord. No. 02-12; 7-7-2006 by Ord. No.
06-03]
For uses making reference to this section, vehicular access shall be
provided only to an existing or planned major thoroughfare, freeway or
service drive; provided, however, that access driveways may be permitted
to other than a major thoroughfare, or freeway service drive if the Planning
Commission determines that allowing such access is equal to or better than
those benefits realized by emptying onto a major thoroughfare.
§ 86-348. Entranceway structures for residential subdivisions or
multifamily housing. [Amended 6-6-1994 by Ord. No. 94-06]
In all residential districts, so-called entranceway structures, including but
not limited to walls, columns and gates, marking entrances to single-family
subdivisions or multiple housing projects, may be permitted and may be
located in a required yard, except as provided in § 86-301, provided that
such entranceway structures shall comply with all codes of the municipality,
and shall be approved by the building inspector and a permit issued.
§ 86-349. Vision clearance at street intersections. [Amended
6-6-1994 by Ord. No. 94-06]

(a) Intent. Landscaping, greenbelts and screening are necessary for the
protection and enhancement of the environment and for the continued
vitality of all land uses in the City. Landscaping and greenbelts are
capable of enhancing the visual environment, preserving natural
features, improving property values, and alleviating the impact of noise,
traffic and visual disruption related to intensive uses. The purpose of
this section is to set minimum standards for the protection and
enhancement of the environment through requirements for the design
and use of landscaping, greenbelts and screening.
§ 86-346 CORUNNA CODE § 86-350
1:608
(b) Scope.
(1) The requirements set forth in this section shall apply to all uses,
lots, sites and parcels which are developed or expanded, following
June 10, 1994, requiring site plan approval. No site plan shall be
approved unless the site plan shows landscaping consistent with
the provisions of this section. Furthermore, where landscaping is
required, a building permit shall not be issued until the required
landscape plan is submitted and approved, and a certificate of
occupancy shall not be issued unless provisions set forth in this
section have been met or a performance bond has been posted in
accordance with the provisions set forth in § 86-391(g).
(2) In cases where the use of an existing building changes or an
existing building is changed or otherwise altered or reoccupied, all
of the standards set forth in this section shall be met.
(3) The requirements of this section are minimum requirements, and
nothing in this section shall preclude a developer and the City from
agreeing to more extensive landscaping.
(c) Design standards. Except as otherwise specified in the general
requirements for each zoning district, all landscaping shall conform to
the following standards:

a. When a driveway intersects a public right-of-way or when the
subject property abuts the intersection of public rights-of-way,
all landscaping within the corner triangular areas described in
Subsection b of this subsection shall permit unobstructed
cross-visibility. Shrubs located in the triangular area shall not
be permitted to grow to a height of more than two feet above
the pavement grade at the edge of the pavement. Portions of
required berms located within sight distance triangular areas
shall also not exceed a height of two feet above the pavement
grade at the edge of the pavement. Trees may be maintained in
this area provided that all branches are trimmed to maintain a
clear vision for a vertical height of eight feet above the
roadway surface. Landscaping, except grass or ground cover,
shall not be located closer than three feet to the edge of a
driveway.
b. The triangular areas referred to in Subsection (c)(6)a of this
subsection are:
1. The area formed at the corner intersection of a public
right-of-way and a driveway, two sides of the triangular

right-of-way lines and the third side being a line
connecting these two sides.
(7) Maintenance. All required landscape areas shall be planted and
maintained with living plant materials. Failure to maintain required
landscaped areas, including the removal and replacement of dead
or diseased plant materials, shall constitute a violation of this
chapter.
(a) Generally. Whenever in this chapter planting is required, it shall be
planted within six months from the date of completion of the building or
improvement, and shall thereafter be reasonably maintained with
permanent plant materials. Plastic and other nonorganic, nonliving
plant materials shall be prohibited from use and shall not be in
compliance with the spirit and intent of this chapter.
(b) Spacing.
(1) Plant materials shall not be placed closer than four feet to the fence

24 inches to the inside line of any sidewalk or street/alley rights-ofway.
(f) Maintenance of nuisance. Fences must be maintained in a neat and safe
condition, so as not to endanger life or property. Any fence which,
through lack of repair, type of construction or otherwise, endangers life
or property is hereby deemed a nuisance. The building department
shall notify the owner, agent or person in control of the property on
which such fence is located of the existence of such nuisance and
specify the required repairs or modifications to be made to render the
fence safe, or require the unsafe fence or any portion thereof to be
removed, and shall provide a time limit for such repairs, modification or
removal.
(g) Existing fences.

fence requirements.
(3) Existing fences may be ordered removed or altered if deemed by
the Chief of Police or building inspector to impede visibility.
(a) In all C-1, C-2, C-3 and I districts, there shall be provided an outdoor
trash storage area. Any such area shall be limited to normal refuse
which is collected on a regular basis and shall be maintained in a neat,
orderly and sanitary condition. The requirement for such a trash
storage area may be waived by the Planning Commission upon a finding
that it is unnecessary due to the nature of the use, or owing to
provisions for indoor trash storage.
(b) In no instance shall any such refuse be visible above the required
screening.
(c) A screen wall, in accordance with § 86-352, of six feet in height, shall

district, subject to the conditions listed in this subsection, a site plan
shall be submitted and approved, approved with conditions, or
disapproved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with the
requirements of this article.
(1) Site plan reviews are required for all permitted principal uses and
structures in all zoning districts (except for single-family detached
and two-family dwellings and their accessory uses) and all
conditional approval uses in all zoning districts.
(2) When the proposed new construction or remodeling constitutes an
addition to an existing building or use, site plan review procedures
may be modified, at the discretion of the building inspector, to
provide for an administrative review by the building inspector in
lieu of a more formal review by the City Planning Commission. The
building inspector may conduct an administrative review provided
both of the following are true:
a. No variances to this chapter are required.
b. The proposed new construction would not increase the total
square footage of the building by more than 25% or 1,000
square feet, whichever is less.
(3) For those cases requiring site plan review solely as a result of
building reoccupancy, site plan review procedures may be
modified, at the discretion of the building inspector, to provide for
an administrative review by the building inspector in lieu of a more
formal review by the City Planning Commission. The building
inspector may conduct an administrative review provided all of the
following are true:
a. Such use is conducted within a completely enclosed building.
b. Reoccupancy does not create additional parking demand
beyond 25% of that which exists.

Planning Commission shall consider:
§ 86-391 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-391
1:633
(1) Specific development requirements set forth in this chapter.
(2) The location and design of driveways providing vehicular ingress to
and egress from the site, in relation to streets giving access to the
site, and in relation to pedestrian traffic.
(3) The traffic circulation features within the site and location of
automobile parking areas, and may make such requirements with
respect to any matters as will ensure:
a. Safety and convenience of both vehicular and pedestrian
traffic, both within the site and in relation to access streets.
b. Satisfactory and harmonious relationships between the
development on the site and the existing and prospective

the establishment and the continued maintenance of any use to
which they are appurtenant.
(6) In those instances wherein the Planning Commission finds that an
excessive number of ingress or egress points may occur with
relation to major or secondary thoroughfares, thereby diminishing
the carrying capacity of the thoroughfare, the Planning
Commission may recommend marginal access drives. For a narrow
frontage, which will require a single outlet, the Planning
Commission may recommend that money be placed in escrow with
the municipality so as to provide for a marginal service drive equal
in length to the frontage of the property involved. Occupancy
permits shall not be issued until the improvement is physically
provided, or monies have been deposited with the Clerk.
(7) The cost estimates, as required in this section, shall be reviewed by

or planner) for their compliance with current cost estimates. These
reviews and recommendations shall be forwarded to the Planning
Commission for inclusion in any approved site plan.
(8) The Planning Commission may waive site plan information for
topography, vegetation, problem soils, landscaping, employment
data, environmental considerations, etc., when such concerns are
obviously not pertinent to the proposed development.

1:634
(9) The Planning Commission, or building inspector as part of
administrative review procedures, shall seek input from local
public safety officials as part of the site plan review process, prior
to approving, disapproving, or approving with conditions the site
plan.
(f) Action by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission, upon
reviewing a site plan, shall take one of the following actions:
(1) Approval. If the site plan meets all the requirements of this chapter
and related development requirements and standards, the Planning
Commission shall record such approval and the chairman shall sign
three copies of the site plan, filing one in the official site plan file,
forwarding one to the building inspector, and returning one to the
applicant.
(2) Disapproval. If the site plan does not meet the requirements of this
chapter and related development requirements and standards, the
Planning Commission shall record the reasons for denial. The
applicant may subsequently refile a corrected site plan under the
same procedures followed for the initial submission.
(3) Conditional approval. If minor corrections to the site are necessary,
which can be clearly noted, then the Planning Commission shall so
note such conditions and the chairman shall sign three site plans as
conditionally approved and stating the necessary conditions. One
copy shall be retained in the official site plan file, one forwarded to
the building inspector, and one returned to the applicant.

Planned Unit Development (PUD)
[Added 6-18-2018 by Ord. No. 18-01]
§ 86-394. Intent.
The purpose of this district is to permit flexibility in the regulation of land
development; to encourage innovation in land use and variety in design,
layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and
efficiency in the use of land, natural resources, energy and the provision of
public services and utilities; to encourage provision of usable open space
and protection of natural features; to provide adequate housing,
employment and shopping opportunities particularly suited to the needs of
the residents of the city; and to encourage the use, reuse and improvement
of existing sites and buildings which will be developed in a compatible
way with surrounding uses but where the uniform regulations contained in
other zoning districts do not provide adequate protections and safeguards
for the site or surrounding area. The district is intended to accommodate
developments with one or more land uses, sites with unusual topography
or unique settings within the community or sites that exhibit difficult or
costly development problems or any combination of these factors. This
zoning district shall not be allowed where this zoning classification is sought
primarily to avoid the imposition of standards and requirements of other
zoning classifications or other city regulations rather than to achieve the
stated purposes above.
§ 86-395. Permitted principal uses.
All permitted principal uses by right or by special use permit in any district
as identified in Article II shall be permitted in the PUD district.
§ 86-396. Standards for approval.
Based upon the following standards, the Planning Commission may
recommend denial, approval, or approval with conditions, and the City
Council may deny, approve, or approve with conditions the proposed
planned unit development.
(a) Off-street parking shall be sufficient to meet the minimum required by
the ordinances of the City. However, if it is deemed necessary in order
to achieve the purposes of this section, the Planning Commission may
relax parking requirements during site plan review.
(b) All streets within the planned unit development shall meet the
minimum requirements of the City Subdivision Control Ordinance and/
or all municipal standards, unless modified by the Planning
Commission.
(c) Landscaping shall be provided so as to ensure that proposed uses will
be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public
and private property. However, if it is deemed necessary in order to
§ 86-394 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 86-396
1:645
§ 86-397. Approval procedure.
achieve the purposes of this article, the Planning Commission may relax
landscaping requirements as part of site plan review.
(d) Judicious effort shall be used to ensure the preservation of the integrity
of the land and the preservation of natural, historical, and architectural
features.
(e) The proposed density of the planned unit development shall be no
greater than that which would be required for each of the component
uses of the development in the zoning district in which it is permitted.
However, if it is deemed necessary in order to achieve the purposes of
this section, the Planning Commission and City Council may permit
increased density as long as the intent of § 86-286 is complied with.
(f) The following regulations concerning traffic and accessory conditions
shall be followed:
(1) Safe, convenient, and well-defined vehicular and pedestrian
circulation within and to the zoning district shall be provided.
(2) Drives and streets shall not be laid out to encourage outside traffic
to traverse the development nor to create unnecessary
fragmentation of the development into small blocks.

Commission shall review the conceptual PUD development plan as
described in § 86-288 to determine its suitability for inclusion in the
land use and zoning plans of the City of Corunna and adoption by City
Council as part of the ordinance.
(b) The Planning Commission shall then submit the proposed amendatory
ordinance to the City Council together with their recommendation and
a summary of comments received at the public hearing.
(c) The City Council shall hold a public hearing meeting subject to
ordinance amendments and regulations under Chapter V of the City
Charter. Following that public hearing, it may amend or place
additional conditions on the zoning ordinance amendment. Except in
the case of ordinances which are declared to be emergency ordinances,
no ordinance shall be finally passed by the Council at the same meeting
at which it is introduced.
(d) PUD site plan approval procedure may commence only after the
acceptance by the City Council of the conceptual PUD development
plan and the rezoning of the property as required.

vary or modify any of its rules, regulations or provisions so that the spirit
of this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial
justice done. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to give or
grant to the Zoning Board of Appeals the authority to make changes in this
chapter or the zoning map acting under the authority of appeal board. The
power and authority to rezone is reserved to the City Council in the manner

in a newspaper of general circulation in the City 15 days prior to the
hearing date. Such notice shall contain the address, if available, and

of Appeals is sought, as well as a brief description of the nature of the
appeal. Any person may appear and testify at the hearing, either in
person or by duly authorized agent or attorney.

Zoning Board of Appeals from a decision of the Planning Commission in
connection with an approved site plan unless such appeal has first been
reviewed by the Planning Commission and a recommendation on the
variance is provided by the Planning Commission.

requirements as lot area and width regulations, building height and
square foot regulations, yard width and depth regulations, such
requirements as off-street parking and loading space, and sign
regulations, and other similar requirements as specified in this chapter.
In reviewing a request for variance, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
ensure that the spirit and intent of this chapter is observed, public
safety secured and substantial justice done. To obtain a variance, the
applicant must show practical difficulty, by demonstrating that:
(1) Strict compliance with area, setbacks, frontage, height, bulk or
density requirements would unreasonably prevent the owner from
using the property for a permitted purpose, or would render the
conformity unnecessarily burdensome;
(2) A variance would do substantial justice to the applicant, as well as
to other property owners in the district;
(3) The plight of the owner is due to the unique circumstances of the
property; and
(4) The problem is in no way self-created.
(a) The Zoning Board of Appeals may impose conditions upon an
affirmative decision. The conditions may include conditions necessary
to ensure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land
use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and
facility loads caused by the land use or activity, to protect the natural
environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to ensure

in a socially and economically desirable manner. Conditions imposed
shall do all of the following:
(1) Be designed to protect natural resources, and the health, safety
and welfare, as well as the social and economic well-being, of those
who will use the land use or activity under consideration, residents
and landowners immediately adjacent to the proposed land use or
activity, and the community as a whole.
(2) Be related to the valid exercise of the police power and purposes
which are affected by the proposed use or activity.
(3) Be necessary to meet the intent and purpose of the zoning
regulations, be related to the standards established in this chapter
for the land use or activity under consideration, and be necessary
to ensure compliance with those standards.
(b) The conditions imposed shall be recorded in the record of the approval
action and shall remain unchanged except upon the mutual consent of
the approving authority and the landowner. The approving authority
shall maintain a record of changes granted in conditions.
(a) The decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be final. However, a
person having an interest affected by this chapter may appeal to the
circuit court.
(b) The Zoning Board of Appeals is without general authority to reconsider
a matter it has decided and from reversing its previous decision unless
the facts and circumstances which actuated the decision have so
changed as to vitiate or materially affect the reason which produced
and supported it, and no vested rights have intervened.

* No building shall be erected on a R-A or R-O zoned lot unless the lot fronts no less than 80% of its full width, upon a street or road that has been
dedicated to the public.
** Per Planning Commission.
NOTES:
(a) See § 86-302, pertaining to average lot size, regarding flexibility
allowances.
(b) For all uses permitted other than single-family residential, the
setback shall equal the height of the main building or the setback
required in this section, whichever is greater.
(c) In the case of a rear yard abutting a side yard, the side yard
abutting a street shall not be less than the minimum front yard of
the district in which located.
(d) In an RM Multiple-Family District, the total number of rooms, not
including kitchen, dining and sanitary facilities, shall not be more
than the area of the parcel, in square feet, divided by 1,200. All
units shall have at least one living room and one bedroom, except
that not more than 10% of the units may be of an efficiency
apartment type. For the purpose of computing the permitted
number of dwelling units per acre, the following room
assignments shall control:
Efficiency: one room.
One-bedroom: two rooms.
Two-bedroom: three rooms.
Three-bedroom: four rooms.
Four-bedroom: five rooms.
Plans presented showing one- , two- or three-bedroom units and
including a den, library or other extra room shall count such extra
room as a bedroom for the purpose of computing density. The area
used for computing density shall be the total site area exclusive of
any dedicated public right-of-way of either interior or bounding
roads.
(e) In all RM Multiple-Family Residential Districts, the minimum
distance between any two buildings shall be regulated according
to the length and height of such buildings, and in no instance shall
this distance be less than 30 feet. Parking may be permitted within
a required side or rear yard but shall not cover more than 30% of
the area of any required yard, or any minimum distance between
buildings. The formula regulating the required minimum distance
between two buildings in all RM Districts is as follows:
S = LA + LB + 2(HA + HB)
Where:
S = Required minimum horizontal distance between any
wall of Building A and any wall of Building B or
the vertical prolongation of either.
LA = Total length of Building A.
The total length of Building A is the length of that
portion or portions of a wall or walls of Building A
from which, when viewed directly from above,
lines drawn perpendicular to Building A will
intersect any wall of Building B.
86 Attachment 1:2 06 - 01 - 2016
ZONING
LB = Total length of Building B.
The total length of Building B is the length of that
portion or portions of a wall or walls of Building B
from which, when viewed directly from above, the
lines drawn perpendicular to Building B will
intersect any wall of Building A.
HA = Height of Building A.
The height of Building A at any given level is the
height above natural grade level of any portion or
portions of a wall or walls along the length of
Building A. Natural grade level shall be the mean
level of the ground immediately adjoining the
portion or portions of the wall or walls along the
total length of the building.
HB = Height of Building B.
The height of Building B at any given level is the
height above natural grade level of any portion or
portions of a wall or walls along the length of
Building B. Natural grade level shall be the mean
level of the ground immediately adjoining the
portion or portions of the wall or walls along the
total length of the building.
(f) Off-street parking shall be permitted to occupy a portion of the
required front yard, provided that there shall be maintained a
minimum unobstructed and landscaped setback of 10 feet between
the nearest point of the off-street parking area, exclusive of access
driveways, and the nearest right-of-way line as indicated on the
major thoroughfare plan.
(g) No side yards are required along the interior side lot lines of the
district, except as otherwise specified in the building code,
provided that, if walls of structures facing such interior side lot
lines contain windows or other openings, side yards of not less
than 10 feet shall be provided.
(h) On a corner lot which has a common lot line with a residential
district, there shall be provided a setback of 20 feet on the side or
residential street. Where a lot borders on a residential district or a
street, there shall be provided a setback of not less than 10 feet on
the side bordering the residential district or street. Loading space
shall be provided in the rear yard in the ratio of at least 10 square
feet per front foot of building and shall be computed separately
from the off-street parking requirements. Where an alley exists or
is provided at the rear of buildings, the rear building setback and
loading requirements may be computed from the center of the
alley.
 (i) On a zoning lot of three acres or more in area, side and rear yard
setbacks shall be 60 feet in depth when abutting a residential
district.
(j) Off-street parking shall be permitted in a side yard setback.
(k) Off-street parking for visitors, over and above the number of
spaces required under § 86-337, may be permitted within the
required front yard, provided that such off-street parking is not
located within 25 feet of the front lot line.
(l) No building shall be located closer than 60 feet to the outer
perimeter (property line) of such district when the property line
abuts any residential district.
(m) All storage shall be in the rear yard and shall be completely
screened with an obscuring wall or fence, not less than five feet
high, or with a chainlink type fence and a greenbelt planting so as
to obscure all view from any adjacent residential or business
district or from a public street.
