PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of the City of Lauderhill of a general and
permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not
included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto.
The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. The
absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of
the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws
and ordinances included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within
each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related
sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each
section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the
chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the
first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the ninth section of Chapter 21 is 21-9. Under this system, each
section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted
in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new
material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be
added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by
the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters
12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12½. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of
chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the
same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the
case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number
being assigned to the article or division.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With
this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory
ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will
be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and
deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part
thereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance.
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the
volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all
such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all
deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Index
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
3/653
The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed
under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and
still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references
within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.

calendar days from the date of receipt by the human resources director of the notice of appeal, decide either to

deadlines described herein should fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday recognized by the city, the
deadline shall be extended to the next day on which the city is open for business. The board shall only exercise
jurisdiction over the appeal once all administrative remedies have been exhausted.

All notices of appeal that come before the board shall be by a written statement setting forth in concise language

appeal. The board shall not be bound to grant only the remedy sought. The employee must also set forth a
statement to the effect that all administrative remedies available to the employee under the city's policy,
including a decision by the chief administrator, have already been exhausted.
(2)
Within five (5) days of the human resources director's receipt of the notice of appeal, the human resources

shall be an affirmation of the original decision of the administration.

irrelevant or immaterial evidence. Subpoenas shall be issued pursuant to city ordinance and shall be limited to
five (5) for each litigant for depositions and five (5) for the hearing, unless the chair agrees to permit the
issuance of additional subpoenas by the city clerk. All evidence of a type commonly relied upon by prudent
persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a
trial court of law in the state. Any written or other documentary evidence shall be admissible if the document or
writing is admissible under the Florida Rules of Evidence. All testimony of parties shall be made under oath.
Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining evidence, but shall not be
sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible, over objections, in civil actions. Any
willful false swearing on the part of any witness or person giving evidence before the board in the proceedings
shall be deemed to be perjury and shall be prosecuted in accordance with state law.
(f)
Board hearings shall be tape recorded; however, such recordings are made for the benefit of the board and city's
internal purposes and may not be relied upon by a party to an appeal to substitute for a court reporter's transcript
of the hearing. Any party who may need a transcript of the hearing shall make independent arrangements to have
a court reporter present at the hearing.
(g)
At either party's discretion, witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until they are called to testify.

requirement of reinstatement and that employee be paid all or part of any pay lost by the employee by virtue of
the employee's suspension, dismissal, or other action, plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
(b)
Any appeal of any decision by the board shall be by the filing of a writ of certiorari within thirty (30) calendar
days of the issuance of the board's written decision with the county circuit court; a successful petition for writ of
certiorari by the employee shall entitle the employee to recover costs and reasonable attorney's fees as
determined by the circuit court. Issuance shall be the date the decision is signed by the chair.
(c)
The tendering of the resignation of the employee prior to final action by the board shall be considered a
withdrawal of the appeal.
(d)
Should the board find that the employee's appeal was without justiciable issue of law or fact or brought with
malice or solely for the intent to harass, the board can, in its discretion, after consultation with the board's
attorney, award the city its costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
(e)
In the event either party willfully and contumaciously disregards the board's rules of procedure, the board may
impose any sanctions it deems appropriate.

beneficiary or beneficiaries as designated by the firefighter for the balance of such ten-year period, or, if no
beneficiary is designated, to the estate. The amount of the benefit shall be determined and paid in the same
manner as for retirement at his normal retirement date except that average monthly earnings and credited service
shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or
(2)
An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and be paid on the
first day of the month. Unless otherwise elected by the member, the last monthly payment will be the payment

(f)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
79/653
Delayed retirement date. The delayed retirement date shall be that date following normal retirement date on
which a member actually retires.
(g)
Delayed retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder at his delayed retirement date shall receive a monthly
retirement benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following such
delayed retirement date. The amount of each monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner
as for normal retirement, except that average monthly earnings and credited service shall be determined as of the

of ten (10) years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries as designated by the
firefighter for the balance of such ten-year period, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the estate.
(h)
Cost of living benefit. Effective October 1, 2006, each retiree who was a Tier One member, including all retirees
who retired prior to October 1, 2006, shall have their monthly retirement benefits increased by a sum equal to
one and one-half (1.5) percent per year (the "COLA"). Tier Two members who retire shall have their monthly
retirement increased by a sum equal to the net return of the plan per year (i.e., the gross return of the plan less
the plan's administrative costs) ("Tier Two COLA"), with a one and one-half (1.5) percent cap and a zero (0)
percent floor per year. Provided however, that before any retiree is entitled to a COLA, the retiree must have
been retired for three (3) years. Following the retiree's death who was a Tier One member, the COLA will be
paid to each designated beneficiary. Following the death of a retiree who was a Tier Two member, the Tier Two
COLA will be paid to each designated beneficiary only if a Tier Two COLA for retirees is to be given as a result
of a net return being earned for the plan that year.
(i)
Variable benefits. For all firefighters employed on or after October 1, 1997, a variable benefit will be paid,
effective October 1, 1999. Based upon procedures and methods adopted by the board of trustees, as determined
to be actuarially sound by the city firefighters' retirement system (the "system") actuaries, benefits currently
payable under this article shall be increased from time to time. The funds required for the financing of any
benefits under this provision shall be derived solely from the investment return of system assets, both realized
and unrealized, as allocable to firefighters and beneficiaries receiving benefits from the system, and only in such
amount as exceeds the investment return assumed for purposes of the actuarial valuation of the system and a
total experience gain under the system as compared to the actuarial assumptions. The benefit increase granted in
any one (1) calendar year shall in no event exceed three (3) percent of the amount being paid immediately prior
thereto. Any increases granted under this provision shall be expressed as a percentage of the retiree's current
benefit, and such percentage shall be uniform in respect to all retirees in any given year, except that retirees
whose payments start during a fiscal year shall receive a pro rata increase reflecting the number of payments
received divided by twelve (12). The increase shall be calculated for each year ending September 30, and shall
be payable effective the following October 1. This provision shall be effective October 1, 1999.
(j)
When the amount of benefit is determined; previous increases in retirement benefits. All benefits will be
determined based on the provisions of this part as of the date the firefighter leaves the employ of the fire
department, unless specifically indicated otherwise. All benefit increases granted by previous ordinances will
remain in full force and effect.

Sec. 2-44. - Disability retirement.
(a)
Eligibility period. The eligibility requirements for service-incurred and nonservice-incurred disability benefits
for all members, shall be as follows:
(1)
Service-incurred: Eligible from entry date as a member of the system.
(2)
Nonservice-incurred: Two (2) years of credited service.
(b)
Disability. Any member otherwise eligible as stated above who, in the opinion of the board of trustees, is wholly
prevented either mentally or physically, from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter for the city,
will be considered totally disabled. The firefighter will be considered permanently disabled, if, in the opinion of
the board of trustees, he or she is likely to remain so disabled continuously and permanently from a cause other
than specified in subsection (c) below.
If a firefighter is collecting disability income from the pension fund, at age fifty-five (55), the firefighter shall
have the option of converting the disability to a normal retirement benefit, provided he/she continues to meet all
eligibility requirements. Credit for service during the period of disability shall be granted for the purposes of
retirement benefits.
(c)
Restrictions. A firefighter will not be entitled to receive any disability retirement income if the disability is a
result of: (a) excessive and habitual use by the firefighter of drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics; (b) injury or disease
sustained by the firefighter while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, or civil insurrections or
while committing a crime; (c) injury or disease sustained by the firefighter while serving in any armed forces;
(d) injury or disease sustained by the firefighter after his or her employment has terminated; or (e) self inflicted
injury.
(d)
Eligibility. No firefighter shall be permitted to retire under the provisions of this section until he or she is
examined by a duly qualified physician or surgeon, to be selected by the board of trustees for that purpose, and is
found to be disabled in a degree and in a manner specified in this section.
(e)
Determination of disability, board decision. No disability benefit shall be granted except upon approval of and
certification by the board of trustees that such disability was service or nonservice-incurred, that such disability
has been substantiated medically to the satisfaction of the board and that the member is totally and permanently
disabled in the line of duty from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter in the city.
(f)
Duration. The monthly retirement income to which a firefighter is entitled in the event of his or her disability
retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board of trustees determines such
entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be retroactive to the entitlement date as determined
by the board, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
81/653
payment will be, if the firefighter recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such
recovery. If the firefighter dies without recovering from disability and unless otherwise elected by the member,
the last monthly payment will be the payment due next preceding the firefighter's death; except that, if the
firefighter dies after his retirement but before he has received retirement benefits for a period of ten (10) years,
the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary or beneficiaries as designated by the firefighter for the
balance of such ten-year period, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the estate.
(g)
Amount of disability. For service and nonservice-incurred disabilities, the monthly benefit shall be the greater
of:
(1)
Fifty (50) percent of the rate of monthly earnings in effect on the date of disability; or
(2)
The monthly benefit accrued to date of disability.
(3)
Total benefits paid (i.e., disability, worker's compensation) shall not exceed one hundred (100) percent of the
employee's salary.
(h)
Required reexamination of disability retirees. Any service or nonservice incurred disability retiree may be
required by the board to undergo a reexamination annually in order to confirm the continued existence of the
disability condition. Any refusal by a member to undergo such examination or reexamination shall result in a
termination of disability payments until such disability condition is again medically substantiated to the
satisfaction of the board.
(i)
Recovery. In the event of recovery from disability as determined by the board, and immediate reemployment by
the city as a firefighter, the period of time while disabled shall be included as credited service. In the event of
recovery, but without immediate reemployment by the city as a firefighter, the member's future benefits shall be
determined as though he initially terminated employment on his date of disability; provided, however, if such
reemployment is prevented by reason of the failure or refusal of the city to provide or offer reemployment as a
firefighter, and provided, however, that such failure of reemployment is not caused by reason of such former
retiree's refusal to accept firefighter employment with the city, then, and in such event, the former disability
retiree shall be entitled to future retirement benefits computed and determined on a basis allowing for credited
service throughout the period of disability.
(j)
Presumptive disease. Any presumption created by general or special act of the state legislature creating a
presumption that certain illnesses have occurred in the line of duty shall be applicable for the purpose of
establishing causation for service-connected disability or death benefits under this plan. The presumptive disease
laws in effect on the date of a member's application for disability or death benefits shall be the presumptions
utilized by the board in considering that member's application for benefits.

direct result of an occurrence arising in the performance of service. The benefits shall be payable as follows:
(1)
To the spouse of a firefighter until death, a monthly benefit equal to twenty (20) percent of the member's rate of
monthly earnings at the time of death, or a refund of contributions equal to the total amount of the deceased
firefighters Accumulated Contributions, whichever amount thereof is greater.
(2)
If there is no spouse, the benefit shall be paid to the member's surviving children until the youngest child reaches
the age of eighteen (18) years. The benefit shall be divided equally among the surviving children who are under
the age of eighteen (18) years. If a refund of the deceased firefighters' Accumulated Contributions is greater than
the benefit, this amount shall be divided equally among the surviving children who are under the age of eighteen
(18) years in lieu of payment of the benefit.
(3)
Upon the death of the spouse of a firefighter who was receiving the benefit, it shall be paid to the member's
surviving children until the youngest child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years. The benefit shall be divided
equally among the surviving children who are under the age of eighteen (18) years. As each child reaches the
age of eighteen (18), the benefit shall be recalculated among the remaining children under the age of eighteen
(18) years. The plan's liability for a payment to minor children shall be unaffected by the total number of
children.
(4)
Notwithstanding subsections (1)(3) above, each firefighter may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed
and filed with the board of trustees, designate a choice of one (1) or more persons other than their spouse or
child under the age of eighteen (18), named sequentially or jointly, as his or her beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to
receive the refund of Accumulated Contributions, which is payable in the event of his or her death; and each
designation may be revoked by such firefighter by signing and filing with the board of trustees a new
designation-of-beneficiary form. If the deceased firefighter has not designated a beneficiary, and does not have a
spouse or child under the age of eighteen (18) years, a refund of Accumulated Contributions will be returned to
the estate.
(5)
In the place of and instead of the benefits set forth in subsection 2-45(a)(1), (2), (3) and (4), if a firefighter had at
least ten (10) years of credited service prior to death, the spouse, or if there is no spouse, the legal guardian of
any surviving children under the age of eighteen (18), or any other beneficiary designated by the firefighter is
entitled to elect to receive the benefits otherwise payable to the firefighter as a ten-year certain benefit only, at
his or her normal retirement date, or at his or her early retirement date with reduction for early commencement
as defined for an early retirement benefit.
(b)
Nonservice-incurred death benefit for members eligible for early or normal retirement benefit. A death benefit
shall be payable on behalf of any member who at time of death is actively employed and who at such time is
eligible for an early or normal retirement benefit. The benefit shall be as follows:
(1)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
83/653
If, at the time of death of a firefighter, such member has a spouse, the death benefit payable shall be determined
as if the member retired from employment on the date of death, elected to receive a benefit in the form of an
actuarially equivalent fifty (50) percent joint and survivor annuity, and died the next day. This amount is payable
to the widow(er) until death. Upon the death of the widow(er) of a firefighter, the benefit shall be paid to or on
behalf of the member's surviving children until the youngest child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years. The
benefit shall be divided equally among the surviving children who are under the age of eighteen (18) years. If, at
time of death, there is no spouse, the benefit shall be determined on a ten-year certain and life-option basis. The
benefit shall be paid to the member's surviving children, if any, until the youngest child reaches the age of
eighteen (18) years. The benefit shall be divided equally among the surviving children who are under the age of
eighteen (18) years. If the youngest child reaches the age of eighteen (18) prior to ten (10) years of benefit
payments, the benefit shall continue for the remainder of the ten-year period.
(2)
In lieu of the benefit set forth in paragraph (b)(1) above, and so long as the deceased firefighter has not
designated a beneficiary (or beneficiaries), other than the spouse or child(ren) under the age of eighteen (18), the
death benefit shall be as follows, if elected by the spouse or children: If a firefighter continues beyond his or her
normal retirement date and dies prior to actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of
this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid,
under the option to a beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the firefighter in the amount or amounts
computed as if the firefighter had retired under the option on the date on which death occurred.
(3)
In the place of and instead of the benefits set forth in subsection 2-45(b)(1) and (2), above, if a firefighter has a
designated beneficiary form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board of trustees, which
designates a choice of one (1) or more persons other than their spouse or child under the age of eighteen (18),
named sequentially or jointly, as his or her beneficiary (or beneficiaries), the beneficiary (or beneficiaries)
designated by the firefighter is entitled to receive the benefits otherwise payable to the firefighter as a ten-year
certain benefit only, at his or her normal retirement date, or at his or her early retirement date with reduction for
early commencement as defined for an early retirement benefit, or if no beneficiary is designated, the payment
will be made to the estate.
(c)
Non-service incurred death benefit for members not eligible for early or normal retirement. A death benefit shall
be payable on behalf of any member who at time of death is actively employed, and who at such time is not
eligible for an early or normal retirement benefit. The benefit shall be as follows:
(1)
If a firefighter had less ten (10) years of credited service prior to death, the beneficiary designated by the
firefighter is entitled to receive a refund of Accumulated Contributions, or if no beneficiary has been designated,
the payment will be made to the estate.
(2)
If a firefighter had at least ten (10) years of credited service prior to death, the beneficiary designated by the
firefighter is entitled to receive the benefits otherwise payable to the firefighter as a ten-year certain benefit only,
at his or her normal retirement date, or at his or her early retirement date with reduction for early
commencement as defined for an early retirement benefit, or if no beneficiary is designated, the payment will be

Sec. 2-47. - Optional forms of benefit payments.
Each member entitled to a normal, early or vested retirement benefit shall have the right, at any time prior to the
date on which benefit payments begin, to elect to have his or her benefit payable under any one of the options
hereinafter set forth in lieu of the benefits otherwise provided herein, and to revoke any such elections and make
a new election at any time prior to the actual beginning of payments. Following the commencement of the
receipt of benefits, including any payments to the member's DROP account, each member will be allowed to
revoke such election and to make a new election, provided that the existing beneficiary is in reasonably good
health. The value of optional benefits shall be actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable,
and the present value of payments to the retiring member must be at least equal to fifty (50) percent of the total
present value of payments to the retiring member and his beneficiary. The member shall make such an election
by written request to the board, such request being retained in the board's files. The board of trustees may charge
a fee for the recalculation of the retirement benefit of no more than is actually charged by the actuary.
(1)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
85/653
Option 1Joint and last survivor option. The member may elect to receive a benefit during his lifetime and have
such benefit (or a designated fraction thereof) continued after his death to his designated beneficiary through his
or her lifetime. In the event there is no living designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, the benefit will be paid to
the estate of the firefighter.
(2)
Option 2Life annuity. The member may elect to receive a monthly benefit commencing on his or her normal
retirement date and paid on the first day of each month thereafter. The last payment will be the payment due next
preceding the firefighter's death.
(3)
Option 3. A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the firefighter during the joint lifetime
of the firefighter and a joint pensioner designated by the firefighter, and following the death of either of them,
one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75) percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3 ) percent, or fifty (50)
percent of such monthly amounts payable to the survivor for the lifetime of the survivor.
(4)
Option 4Other. In lieu of the other optional forms enumerated in this section, benefits may be paid in any form
approved by the board so long as actuarial equivalence with the benefits otherwise payable is maintained.
(5)
Option 5Pop-up option. In the event of an election of Option 1 and Option 2, the member may elect to also
receive a "pop-up option." If a member elects a pop-up option in conjunction with Option 1 and Option 2, and
the beneficiary dies while the member is still alive, and no new designated beneficiary is designated, the member
will receive a reduced retirement benefit but the amount of benefit will return to what the benefit would have
been had the member not chosen a pop-up option.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-33, § 1, 6-26-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-58, § 3, 9-24-01; Ord. No. 04O-10-225, § 3, 11-8-04)
Sec. 2-48. - Beneficiaries.
(a)
The firefighter electing any option will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive
the benefit, if any, payable under the plan in the event of his or her death, and will have the power to change
such designation from time to time, but any such change shall be deemed a new election and will be subject to
approval by the board of trustees. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary
beneficiaries where applicable. If a firefighter has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and his
or her retirement income benefits have commenced, the firefighter may change the designated joint pensioner or
beneficiary, but only if the board of trustees consents to such change and if the joint pensioner previously
designated by the firefighter is alive when the firefighter files with the board of trustees a request for such
change.
(b)
The consent of a firefighter's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required.
(c)
The board of trustees may request such evidence of good health of the joint pensioner or beneficiary that is being
removed as it may require and the amount of the retirement income payable to the firefighter upon designation
of a new joint pensioner or beneficiary shall be actuarially redetermined taking into account the age and sex of
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
86/653
the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the firefighter. Each such designation will be made in
writing on a form prepared by the board of trustees and on completion will be filed with the board of trustees. In
the event that no designated beneficiary survives the firefighter, such benefits as are payable in the event of the
death of the firefighter subsequent to his or her retirement shall be paid to the estate.
(d)
Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this
section and shall be subject to the following limitations:
(1)
If a firefighter dies prior to his or her normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no
retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined
under section 2-45.
(2)
If the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries or joint pensioner dies before the firefighters retirement under the
plan, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount
will be payable to the firefighter upon retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is
made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the firefighter prior
to retirement and within ninety (90) days after the death of the beneficiary.
(3)
If both the retired firefighter and the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by him or her die before the full
payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made
pursuant to the provisions of section 2-47, the board of trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted
value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum.
(4)
No firefighter may make any change to his or her retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing the
first retirement check, except as provided herein.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-33, § 1, 6-26-00)

all regular contributions of members. The city shall derive pickup amounts from the same source of funds which
is used in compensating members of the retirement system and shall do so by reducing the earnable
compensation of each member. All pick-up amounts shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of
determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.
(2)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
87/653
Interest. Interest shall be credited and compounded annually to member contributions and contributions picked
up on behalf of members at an amount to be set by the board but not less than a three (3) percent rate of interest.
(3)
Guaranteed refund. All benefits payable under this system are in lieu of a refund of accumulated contributions.
In any event, however, each member shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits on his behalf at least equal in
the total amount to his accumulated contributions plus interest credited.
(b)
State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the state, for the express purpose of
funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city, shall be deposited in the trust fund
comprising part of this system.
(c)
City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make an annual contribution to the trust fund
in an amount at least equal to the difference in each year as between the total of aggregate member contributions
for the year plus state contributions for the year and the total cost for the year as shown by the most recent
actuarial valuation and report for the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total of normal
cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded accrued past service liability over a fortyyear
period commencing with the fiscal year in which the effective date of this system occurs. Forfeited amounts
arising by reason of nonvested termination shall be applied to reduce future contributions to the system.
(d)
Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be
accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be
used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what
would have otherwise been required city contributions.

Sec. 2-52. - Repeal or termination of system.

any reason or because of a transfer, merger or consolidation of governmental units, services, or functions as
provided in chapter 121, or upon written notice by the City of Lauderhill to the board of trustees that the
contributions under the plan are being permanently discontinued, the rights of all employees to benefits accrued
to the date of such termination and the amounts credited to the employees' accounts are nonforfeitable. The fund
shall be apportioned and distributed in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
95/653
The board of trustees shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value to be distributed, after taking
into account the expenses of such distribution.
(2)
The board of trustees shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, that is, whether distribution
shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of
additional annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in
subsection (3).
(3)
The board of trustees shall apportion the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this
subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income shall mean the
actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution
determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the
retirement income shall mean the single premium payable for such an annuity.
a.
Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retired firefighter after receiving a retirement income
hereunder on such date, each person receiving a retirement income on such date on account of a retire (but since
deceased) firefighter, and each firefighter who has, by such date, become eligible for normal retirement but has
not yet retired, in the amount required to provide such retirement income, provided that, if such asset value is
less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of
such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value.
b.
If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment under paragraph (a), apportionment shall next be
made in respect of each firefighter in the service of the City of Lauderhill on such date who has completed at
least ten (10) years of credited service, in the firefighters' pension trust fund for at least ten (10) years, and who
is not entitled to an apportionment under paragraph (a), in the amount required to provide the actuarial
equivalent of the accrued normal retirement income, based on the firefighter's credited service and earnings to
date, and each former participant then entitled to a benefit under the provisions of F.S. § 175.211 who has not by
such date reached his or her retirement date, in the amount required to provide the actual equivalent of the
accrued normal retirement income to which he or she is entitled under F.S. § 175.211; provided that, if such
remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall
be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset
value.
c.
If there is any asset value after the apportionments under paragraph a. and b., apportionment shall lastly be made
in respect of each firefighter in the service of the City of Lauderhill on such date who is not entitled to an
apportionment under paragraphs a. and b. in the amount equal to the firefighter's total contributions to the plan to
date of termination; provided that, if such remaining asset value is less than the aggregate of the amounts
apportioned hereunder, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such
reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value.

In the event that there is asset value remaining after the full apportionment specified in paragraphs a., b. and c.,
such excess shall be returned to the City of Lauderhill, less return to the state's contributions, provided that, if
the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City of Lauderhill and the state to date of termination

of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City of Lauderhill
and the state.
(4)
The board of trustees shall distribute, in accordance with the manner of distribution determined under subsection
(2), the amounts apportioned under subsection (3). If, after a period of twenty-four (24) months after the date on
which the plan terminated or the date on which the board received written notice that the contributions
thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City of Lauderhill or the board of trustees of the
firefighters' pension trust fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Division of
Retirement shall effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.
(5)
Under no circumstances before the satisfaction of all liabilities to members and their beneficiaries shall any part
of the corpus or income of the trust fund be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit

Sec. 2-53. - Miscellaneous.
(1)
Medical board. For the purpose of providing supporting and substantiating evidence, professional medical
opinion and documentation in disputed or difficult cases of disability wherein such assistance to the board is
deemed necessary, the board of trustees shall appoint a medical board to be composed of three (3) physicians.
The board of trustees shall determine whether or not the services of the medical board are necessary to the
rendition of a final and fair decision as regards any disability applicant or claim arising under this plan.
Whenever it is deemed necessary to call upon the medical board, it shall be the function of such medical board
to arrange for examinations, investigate all pertinent statements and claims made by or on behalf of a disability
applicant and issue a written report of findings thereon to the board of trustees. The board, in such cases where
the findings and opinions of the medical board are sought, may take into consideration all such findings and
opinions, but the board of trustees alone shall make the final decision regarding a disability claim. Nothing
herein shall be construed to require the board of trustees to request or use, the services of the medical board as
regards a disability claim or claimant, it being within the board's discretion to make a final decision in all such
cases.
Payment for services of the medical board shall be determined by the board of trustees in all cases where such
services are requested by the board.
(2)
Discharged members. Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit the same upon dismissal from the
department, but may forfeit their pension as provided for in general law.

other legal process.

97/653
Pension validity. The board of trustees shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension
shall heretofore have been granted under any prior or existing law, or shall hereafter be granted or obtained
erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. Said board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any
person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or hereafter granted under this division if the
same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has
heretofore under prior or existing law or who shall hereafter under this division be erroneously, improperly or
illegally classified.
(5)
Incompetents. If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is, in the judgment of the board, otherwise incapable
of personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due him under the system, the board may,
unless and until claims shall have been made by a duly appointed guardian or committee of such person, make
such payment or any part thereof to such person's spouse, children or other person deemed by the board to have
incurred expenses or assumed responsibility for the expenses of such person. Any payment so made shall be a
complete discharge of any liability under the system for such payment.
(6)
Employment and membership in the system. Participation in the system shall not give any employee the right to
be retained in employment, nor, upon dismissal or upon his voluntary termination of employment, to have any
right or interest in the fund other than is herein provided. Further, no person shall be entitled to remain in
employment, regardless of age, if in the opinion of the city such person is incapable of, or falls to satisfactorily
perform his assigned job functions, for reasons of physical infirmity, emotional or mental impairment, lack of
aptitude for the position held or for other cause. Discharge, forced retirement, refusal to hire or denial of
promotion may not be determined solely on the basis of age prior to attainment of age seventy (70).
(7)
Maximum pension.
a.
Basic limitation. Subject to the adjustments hereinafter set forth, the maximum amount of annual retirement
income payable with respect to a member under this fund shall not exceed one hundred sixty thousand dollars
($160,000.00).
For purposes of applying the above limitation, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity
with no ancillary benefits shall be adjusted, as provided by treasury regulations, so that such benefits are the
actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be
taken into account:
1.
Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits;
2.
Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the [Internal Revenue] Code and regulations
thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Section 415(b)(1) of the [Internal Revenue]
Code.
b.
Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limitation of this section with respect to any member who at any
time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the [Internal Revenue]
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
98/653
Code) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all defined benefit plans in which
the member has been a member were payable from one (1) plan.
c.
Adjustments in limitations.
1.
In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the one hundred sixty
thousand dollar ($160,000.00) limitation prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with
regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the [Internal
Revenue] Code, so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement
income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit
beginning at age sixty-two (62).
2.
In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service, the adjustments
provided for in a. above shall not apply.
3.
The reductions provided for in a. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits or preretirement death
benefits.
4.
In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of
determining whether this benefit meets the limitation set forth in subsection a. herein, such benefit shall be
adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall
be made using an assumed interest rate of five (5) percent and shall be made in accordance with regulations
promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.
d.
Less than ten (10) years of service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member
who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined
under subsection a. of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the
member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided for in this
subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits.
e.
Ten thousand dollar ($10,000.00) limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with
respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limitations set forth in this section if the benefits payable,
with respect to such member under this fund and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which
the city contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable plan year and for any
prior plan year and the city has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the
member participated.
f.
Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be
accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member
participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
99/653
benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such
other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the
member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently
accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for
such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority
pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member.
g.
Cost-of-living adjustments. The limitations as stated in subsections a., b., c. and f. herein shall be adjusted to the
time payment of a benefit begins in accordance with any cost-of-living adjustments prescribed by the Secretary
of the Treasury pursuant to Section 415(d) of the [Internal Revenue] Code.
h.
Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:
1.
The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has
not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred (100)
percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to
supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments.
2.
No member of the fund shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole
based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a
retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement fund or plan. This restriction does not apply
to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code.
(8)
Vesting. The plan shall conform with Section 411(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall only employ vesting
requirements resulting from an application of Sections 401(a)(4) and 401(a)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
in effect on September 1, 1974.
(9)
Maximum compensation. Notwithstanding any provision of this fund to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and
service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Code, Section 414(u).

Sec. 2-54. - Deferred retirement option plan (DROP).
1.
There is hereby created a DROP Plan.
2.
Eligibility. Effective October 1, 2003, any firefighter who is a Tier One member of the City of Lauderhill
Firefighters' Retirement Trust Fund is eligible to enter the DROP on the first day of the month following the
participant's completion of twenty (20) years of credited service or upon earning a pension benefit equal to
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
100/653
eighty (80) percent. If a Tier One member enters the DROP more than ninety (90) days after attaining the eighty
(80) percent accrued benefit, the amount of time after the accrual of the eighty (80) percent benefit until the
entry into the DROP will result in a commensurate reduction in the maximum time allowed for DROP
participation. All those persons who are eligible to enter the DROP may enter into a five-year DROP at any time
during the ninety (90) days window following the effective date of this section. Tier Two members may enter
into the DROP on the first day of the month following the Tier Two member's completion of twenty-five (25)
years of credited service. A Tier Two member may participate in the DROP for a maximum of sixty (60)
months. The number of months a Tier Two member may participate in the DROP shall be reduced by one (1)
month for each month of eligibility following the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service during
which the member does not participate in the DROP.
3.
The maximum participation in DROP shall be sixty (60) months, except as provided in subsection 4, below. All
those persons who are DROP participants on the effective date of the adoption of this section may extend their
DROP participation for an additional number of months so that their total number of months does not exceed
sixty (60).
4.
Retroactive entry into the DROP. If a firefighter has completed twenty (20) years of credited services as of
October 1, 2000, and elects within a ninety-day period after the enactment of this section to enter the DROP, the
firefighter may elect to enter the DROP retroactively to October 1, 2000. In such event, the firefighter's pension
benefit will be calculated in accordance with that firefighter's credited service and average final compensation as
of October 1, 2000. All contributions paid by the firefighter will be deposited into the firefighter's DROP
account. The maximum participation in the DROP will be thirty-six (36) months.
5.
Calculation of retirement benefits upon entering the DROP. Upon entering the DROP, the employee shall not
receive any additional creditable service for pension purposes. Additionally, the amount of average final
compensation for calculation of pension benefits shall be determined as of the date of entering the DROP. No
payment shall be made for accrued unused leave upon entering the DROP, nor shall the amount of accrued
unpaid leave be used in the calculation in the amount of pension benefits.
6.
Election of optional forms of payment. Upon entering the DROP, the firefighter must elect an optional form of
payment. The initial election of an optional form of benefit payment, may be changed in accordance with section
2-47.
7.
Contributions. Upon the effective date of the firefighter's commencement of participation in the DROP, the
firefighter's contribution shall be discontinued.
8.
Irrevocable resignation. The City of Lauderhill Firefighters' Retirement System shall promulgate the appropriate
administrative forms for administering the DROP, which forms must include, at a minimum, an irrevocable
resignation from employment of the city, which is effective no more than three (3) years from the date of entry
into the DROP. The resignation is irrevocable. A DROP member may actually separate from service prior to the
expiration of the three-year period, but may not continue in the employ of the city as a firefighter after the three
(3) year period. A DROP member may participate in the DROP only once.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
101/653
9.
Limitation or disqualification for other benefits. Upon commencement of participation in the DROP, the
employee shall not be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits.
10.
Payments to DROP account. The monthly retirement benefits, including any variable benefits paid pursuant to
section 2-43 that would have been payable had the member elected to cease employment and not join the DROP,
shall be deposited in the participant's DROP account. The money in all participants' DROP accounts will be
commingled with all other assets of the fund, but separate accountings shall be made. On each October 1,
January 1, April 1, and July 1, the participant's DROP account shall be credited at a rate of interest equal to the
actual rate of return achieved by the trust fund net of administrative expenses, as determined by the board of
trustees. Alternatively, at the option of any Tier One member, the Tier One member's DROP account will be paid
a fixed amount as determined by the board of trustees. In no event will this fixed amount be greater than the
actuarially assumed investment earnings. Following resignation and prior to distribution, a rate of interest, as
determined by the board of the trustees, shall be credited to the participant's DROP account. Tier Two members
shall not have the option of receiving a fixed amount in their DROP account. The DROP variable interest rate
for Tier Two members shall have a floor of zero (0) percent.
11.
Distribution.
a.
Upon termination of a DROP participant's employment with the city as a firefighter, for any reason, the
retirement benefits payable to the participant or to the participant's beneficiary (if the participant selected an
optional form or retirement benefit which provides for payments to the beneficiary) shall be paid to the member,
or, if the member is deceased, to the member's designated beneficiary or, if there is no surviving designated
beneficiary, then to the member's estate and shall no longer be credited to the participant's DROP account.
b.
Within thirty (30) days following the end of any calendar quarter after the termination of the participant's
employment as a firefighter, for any reason, the balance credited to the participant's DROP account shall be
payable at the participant's option in either of the following fashions:
(i)
All accrued DROP benefits, less withholding taxes remitted to the Internal Revenue Service, will be paid in a
single lump sum payment to the DROP participant; or if the firefighter is deceased, to the surviving designated
beneficiary; or if there is no surviving designated beneficiary, to the estate; or
(ii)
The benefit may be paid as a direct rollover into any qualified plan that accepts rollovers, as defined in Section
402(c)(8)(B). If the benefit is to be paid to a designated beneficiary's qualified plan, the transfer shall be to an
individual retirement account or annuity as described in Section 402(c)(9).
12.
Death of a DROP participant. If a DROP participant dies before his or her account balance is paid in full, the
participant's surviving designated beneficiary, or if there is no surviving designated beneficiary, the participant's
estate, shall have the same rights as the participant to elect and receive the same benefit options as available to
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
102/653
retired firefighters. DROP payments to the beneficiaries or estates shall be in addition to any retirement benefits
payable to the designated beneficiary.
13.
Administrative rules and regulations. The board of trustees shall have authority to promulgate administrative
rules and regulations for the carrying out of the DROP, including the withholding of monies from the DROP
payments for a period of time as sufficient to insure that the trust fund will not absorb any loss as a result of a
negative rate of return in the DROP account.

Sec. 2-55. - Supplemental retirement benefit.
There is hereby created a supplemental retirement benefit to be funded and payable as follows:
(1)
By the payment to the supplemental retirement benefit fund seventy-five (75) percent of the City of Lauderhill
Firefighters' Retirement Trust Fund's prior years actuarial gain remaining after the application of payments of
variable benefits provided in section 2-43(h) hereof and fifty (50) percent of the annual chapter 175 premium tax
revenues received by the city in accordance with F.S. ch. 175, as provided in subsection 2-58(b); and
(2)
The supplemental retirement benefit shall be paid in equal monthly installments, effective October 1 to retirees
or their beneficiaries (when the retiree is deceased). The benefit will be paid to the beneficiaries of eligible
retirees as defined in subsection (9) below upon the retiree's death, but only if the retiree retired or was eligible
to retire as of September 30, 2016 (i.e., grandfathered). For all other individuals who retire on or after October 1,
2016 and who were not eligible to retire until on or after October 1, 2016, the benefit shall terminate upon their
death. The annual payments to a retiree shall not exceed one (1) year's payment of the premium cost of the
individual retiree health insurance provided by the city, for the previous September 30.
(3)
The first supplemental retirement benefit shall be paid effective October 1, 2003, if money is available to pay it.
(4)
The amount of the supplemental retirement benefit shall be determined as follows. Each October 1, the board
shall determine the total amount of funds available in the supplemental benefit fund. The board shall also
determine the total number of current retirees and vested participants in the plan. The total funds available in the
supplemental retirement benefit fund shall be divided by the total number of retirees and vested participants, and
the quotient shall be the annual supplemental benefit paid to each retiree in monthly installments. In no event
shall the total supplemental benefit paid to a retiree exceed the annual premium, paid by the city for individual
health insurance coverage. All funds not distributed to retirees shall remain in the supplemental retirement
benefit fund.
(5)
For each year, fifty (50) percent of the annual chapter 175 premium tax revenue plus the remaining actuarial gain
shall be placed in a "future benefit reserve account" to be used for additional future benefits to the retirees or
retirees and their designated beneficiaries. The amount of money presently in the future benefit reserve account,
plus any additional money added to it, may be used to pay the supplemental benefit provided for in this section
2-55, or for any future benefit to be later determined through negotiations between the city and the union.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
103/653
(6)
Participants in the DROP, though included in paragraph (4), the purposes of calculating the annual supplemental
benefit, are not eligible for the supplemental retirement benefits, until such time as they separate from service.
(7)
The creation of the supplemental retirement benefit account and the future benefit reserve account are for
bookkeeping purposes. The monies in said accounts may be commingled with all the other assets of the trust.
(8)
Administrative rules and regulations. The board of trustees shall have authority to promulgate administrative
rules and regulations for the carrying out of the supplement retirement benefit.

employment shall not operate to reinstate the person as an active member of the fund and no deductions shall be
made from his or her salary as contributions thereto; nor shall said retiree, as a result of such duty, be considered
an eligible employee for purposes of the fund.
(b)

Nonservice-incurred: Two (2) years of continuous service.
(b)
Disability-benefit, duration and amount. Any member otherwise eligible as stated above who receives a service
or nonservice incurred injury, illness, disease or disability, and which illness, injury, disease or disability
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
111/653
permanently incapacitates him physically or mentally from his regular and continuous duty as a general
employee or firefighter shall receive a disability benefit. The benefit shall commence following the expiration of
benefits provided by the city due to such disability, other than Social Security and worker's compensation, and
shall continue until the earlier of death or recovery from such disability. In the event of recovery prior to the
otherwise normal retirement date, credit for service during the period of disability shall be granted for purposes
of subsequent retirement benefits.
If a general employee is collecting disability income from the pension fund, at age sixty-two (62), the general
employee shall have the option of converting the disability to a normal retirement benefit provided he/she
continues to meet all eligibility requirements. Credit for service during the period of disability shall be granted
for purposes of retirement benefits. If a firefighter is collecting disability income from the pension fund, at age
fifty-five (55), the firefighter shall have the option of converting the disability to a normal retirement benefit,
provided he/she continues to meet all eligibility requirements. Credit for service during the period of disability
shall be granted for the purposes of retirement benefits.
The benefit shall be calculated as follows:
General employees: For service- and nonservice-incurred disabilities, the monthly benefit shall be the greater of:
(1)
Twenty (20) percent of the rate of monthly earnings in effect on the date of disability; or
(2)
The monthly benefit accrued to date of disability.
(3)
Total benefits paid (i.e., disability, worker's compensation, Social Security) shall not exceed one hundred (100)
percent of an employee's salary.
Firefighters: For service- and nonservice-incurred disabilities, the monthly benefit shall be the greater of:
(1)
Fifty (50) percent of the rate of monthly earnings in effect on the date of disability; or
(2)
The monthly benefit accrued to date of disability.
(3)
Total benefits paid (i.e., disability, worker's compensation, Social Security) shall not exceed one hundred (100)
percent of the employee's salary for service-incurred disability, and shall not exceed eighty (80) percent for
nonservice-incurred disability.
(c)
Determination of disability, board decision. No disability benefit shall be granted except upon approval of and
certification by the board of trustees that such disability was service or nonservice-incurred, that such disability
has been substantiated medically to the satisfaction of the board and that the member cannot perform his regular
duties.
(d)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
112/653
Other available city employment. If the city provides or makes available any city job or position which can be
undertaken and performed by a disability retiree at any time during the period of disability, such job or position
must be accepted and fulfilled by such disability retiree unless the board, pursuant to established procedures,
determines that such disability retiree is unable to perform such job or position. If such employment is not
accepted by the disability retiree, the board shall forthwith terminate all disability benefits until such time as
such alternative employment is accepted. If such employment is accepted, the disability benefit shall be reduced
by fifty (50) percent of the amount payable, provided that in no event shall the disability benefit be reduced to a
level where the resulting total monies payable to the disability retiree (disability payment plus employment
compensation) be less than seventy (70) percent of the earnings in effect for such retiree on the date of disability.
Provided, further, any job or position offered to a disabled retiree shall constitute employment commensurate
with the ability of and the previous position occupied by such disability retiree. No member or former member
shall be forced or retired to fulfill a position, job or employment of any type with the city which would fail to
recognize the prior established ability and position of such disabled person. In the event of an irreconcilable
situation arising as a result of an unsuitable position being offered to a disabled retiree, such retiree may, upon
application, have the matter finally resolved by the city council with the decision of the city council in any such
case to be final and binding on the disabled retiree, the city and the board of trustees of the retirement system.
(e)
Required reexamination of disability retirees. Any service or nonservice incurred disability retiree may be
required by the board to undergo a reexamination annually in order to confirm the continued existence of the
disability condition. Any refusal by a member to undergo such examination or reexamination shall result in a
termination of disability payments until such disability condition is again medically substantiated to the
satisfaction of the board.
(f)
Additional provisions re disability retirees:
(1)
Exclusions. Disability benefits shall not be payable in cases where the disability arose as a result of the member's
own willful intent or self-inflicted injury, intoxication, or use of narcotics or other items considered to be
dangerous drugs, or commission of a criminal act.
(2)
Recovery. In the event of recovery from disability as determined by the board, and immediate reemployment by
the city, the period of time while disabled shall be included as continuous service. In the event of recovery, but
without immediate reemployment by the city, the member's future benefits shall be determined as though he
initially terminated employment on his date of disability; provided, however, if such reemployment is prevented
by reason of the failure or refusal of the city to provide or offer acceptable employment, giving due
consideration to the then ability and capacity of such recovered disability retiree; and provided, also, that such
failure of reemployment is not caused by reason of such former retiree's failure or refusal to accept suitable city
employment; then, and in such event, the former disability retiree shall be entitled to future retirement benefits
computed and determined on a basis allowing for continuous service throughout the period of disability. In the
event of an irreconcilable situation arising hereunder, the matter shall be resolved by the city council.
(g)
Presumptive disease. Any presumption created by general or special act of the state legislature creating a
presumption that certain illnesses have occurred in the line of duty shall be applicable for the purpose of
establishing causation for service-connected disability or death benefits under this plan. The presumptive disease
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
113/653
laws in effect on the date of a member's application for disability or death benefits shall be the presumptions
utilized by the board in considering that member's application for benefits.

Upon remarriage or death of the widow(er) of a general employee, the benefit shall be paid to or in behalf of the
member's surviving children until the youngest child reaches the age of eighteen (18) years. The benefit shall be

Sec. 2-67. - Optional forms of benefit payments.
Each member entitled to a normal, early or vested retirement benefit shall have the right, at any time prior to the
date on which benefit payments begin, to elect to have his benefit payable under any one of the options
hereinafter set forth in lieu of the benefits otherwise provided herein, and to revoke any such elections and make
a new election at any time prior to the actual beginning of payments. The value of optional benefits shall be
actuarially equivalent to the value of benefits otherwise payable, and the present value of payments to the
retiring member must be at least equal to fifty (50) percent of the total present value of payments to the retiring
member and his beneficiary. The member shall make such an election by written request to the board, such
request being retained in the board's files.
Option 1. Joint and last survivor option.
The member may elect to receive a benefit during his lifetime and have such benefit (or a designated fraction
thereof) continued after his death to and during the lifetime of his spouse or a relative other than his spouse. The
election of Option 1 shall be null and void if the designated beneficiary dies before the member's benefit
payments commence.
Option 2. Ten years certain and life thereafter.
The member may elect to receive a benefit with one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments guaranteed. If,
after payments commence, the member should die before said one hundred twenty (120) monthly payments are
made, payments are then continued to his designated beneficiary until one hundred twenty (120) payments in all
have been made, at which time benefits cease. After expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) monthly
payments guaranteed, should the retired member be then alive, payments shall be continued during his
remaining lifetime.
Option 3. Other.
In lieu of the other optional forms enumerated in this section, benefits may be paid in any form approved by the
board so long as actuarial equivalence with the benefits otherwise payable is maintained.

11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
116/653
(a)
Member contributions.
(1)
Amount. Regular contributions of tier one, tier two and tier three members shall be at the rate of ten (10.0)
percent of earnings. The city shall pick up, rather than deduct, all regular contributions of members. The city
shall derive pick-up amounts from the same source of funds which is used in compensating members of the
retirement system and shall do so by reducing the earnable compensation of each member. All pick-up amounts
shall be treated as employer contributions for purposes of determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended.
(2)
Interest. Interest shall be credited and compounded annually to member contributions and contributions picked
up on behalf of members at not less than a three (3) percent rate of interest.
(3)
Guaranteed refund. All benefits payable under this system are in lieu of a refund of accumulated contributions.
In any event, however, each member shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits on his behalf at least equal in
the total amount to his accumulated contributions plus interest credited.
(b)
State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of Laws of the State of Florida, for the express
purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for firefighters of the city, shall be deposited in the trust
fund comprising part of this system.
(c)
City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make an annual contribution to the trust fund
in an amount at least equal to the difference in each year as between the total of aggregate member contributions
for the year plus state contributions for the year and the total cost for the year as shown by the most recent
actuarial valuation and report for the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total of normal
cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded accrued past service liability over a fortyyear
period commencing with the fiscal year in which the effective date of this system occurs. Forfeited amounts
arising by reason of nonvested termination shall be applied to reduce future contributions to the system.
(d)
Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be
accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be
used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what
would have otherwise been required city contributions.
(e)
Restoration of prior service. Members shall be permitted to restore any prior service through the member's date
of hire, provided that the member pays the total actuarial cost of the prior service. Member contributions of the
actuarially determined cost of the restored service may be made in one lump sum, by rollover, or may be made
by payroll deductions in installments for a period of time which shall not exceed the number of years being
purchased. A member electing to make installment payments shall be charged interest based on the actuarially
assumed rate of return for the plan. A member making installment payments shall complete all required
payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
117/653
(f)
Purchase of permissive service credit. Members shall be permitted to purchase up to five years of service credit,
provided that the member pays the total actuarial cost of the additional service. Permissive service will be
treated as service credit for purposes of retirement eligibility, but not for vesting. Member contributions of the
actuarially determined cost of the permissive service credit may be made in one lump sum or may be made by
payroll deductions in installments for a period of time which shall not exceed the number of years being
purchased. A member electing to make installment payments shall be charged interest based on the actuarially
assumed rate of return for the plan. A member making installment payments shall complete all required
payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section.
(g)
[Purchase of retirement benefit multiplier.] Members who have transferred to the Confidential and Managerial
Retirement Plan subsequent to October 1, 2002, but prior to October 1, 2006, shall receive an increase in their
retirement benefit multiplier so that they receive a three (3) percent retirement benefit multiplier for all credited
service in the General Employees' Pension Fund.

(1)
This division establishing the system and the fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and
fund, may be modified, terminated or amended, in whole or in part; provided, that if this [division] or any
subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the
amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment or repeal shall have accrued to the
member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be
determined to be inadequate.
(2)
If this division shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, the board shall continue to
administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this division for the sole benefit of the then members,
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
123/653
and beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under
one of the options provided for in this division who are designated by any of said members. In the event of
repeal, or if contributions to the system are discontinued, there shall be full vesting one hundred (100) percent)
of benefits accrued to date of repeal and the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to
provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled to benefits in accordance with the provisions
hereof.
(3)
The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system upon repeal or
termination of this division or if contributions to the system are discontinued:
(a)
Members already retired under the normal and early retirement provisions of the plan and those eligible for
normal or early retirement but not actually retired, and beneficiaries receiving a retirement income on such date
on account of a retired but since deceased member, to the extent of the actuarially determined present value of
the benefits payable; provided that, if such asset value be less than the aggregate of such amount, such amounts
shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value.
If any funds remain, then:
(b)
Members retired under the disability provisions of this plan and their beneficiaries in the same manner as in (3)
(a) above, including proportionate reduction if there be insufficient assets.
If any funds remain, then:
(c)
All other members and their beneficiaries in the same manner as in (3)(a), but based upon continuous service
and average monthly earnings as of the date of termination of the plan, with any benefits vested under provisions
of this system given precedence; provided that, if assets are insufficient, the benefits payable shall be
proportionately reduced.
If any funds remain, then:
(d)
Each member's accumulated contributions to date of termination, less prior distribution, and less the actuarial
present value of benefits to which such member is entitled under (3)(a), (b) or (c) above, if any; provided that, if
assets are insufficient, the amounts payable shall be proportionately reduced.
(e)
In the event that there be assets remaining after the full apportionment specified in paragraphs (3)(a), (b), (c) and
(d), such excess shall be returned to the city, less return of state's contributions to the state; provided, that if the
excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such
excess shall be divided proportionately as among the total contributions made by the city and the state.
The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through
the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this
subsection. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to said benefits or the distribution
may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The trust may be continued in
existence for purposes of subsequent distribution.

124/653
If, at any time during the first ten (10) years after the effective date of the division as respects the city, the system
shall be terminated, or the full current costs of the system (consisting of the normal costs and interest on any
unfunded accrued liability) shall not have been met, anything in the division to the contrary notwithstanding,
city contributions which may be used for the benefit of any one of the twenty-five (25) highest paid members in
the system on the effective date, whose anticipated annual retirement allowance provided by the city's
contributions at his normal retirement date would exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00), shall
not exceed the greater of either:
(a)
Twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00); or,
(b)
An amount computed by multiplying the smaller of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or twenty (20) percent of
such employee's average annual earnings during his last five (5) years of service by the number of years of
service since the effective date.
In the event that it shall hereafter be determined by statute, court decision, ruling by the commissioner of
Internal Revenue, or otherwise, that the provisions of this paragraph are not necessary to qualify the system
under the Internal Revenue Code, this paragraph shall be ineffective without the necessity of further amendment
of this division.
After all the vested and accrued benefits provided hereunder have been paid and after all other liabilities have
been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city.

(1)
Miscellaneous provisions:
1.
Medical board. For the purpose of providing supporting and substantiating evidence, professional medical
opinion and documentation in disputed or difficult cases of disability wherein such assistance to the board is
deemed necessary, the board of trustees shall appoint a medical board to be composed of three (3) physicians.
The board of trustees, with city approval, shall determine whether or not the services of the medical board are
necessary to the rendition of a final and fair decision as regards any disability applicant or claim arising under
this plan.
Whenever it is deemed necessary to call upon the medical board, it shall be the function of such medical board
to arrange for examinations, investigate all pertinent statements and claims made by or on behalf of a disability
applicant and issue a written report of findings thereon to the board of trustees. The board, in such cases where
the findings and opinions of the medical board are sought, may take into consideration all such findings and
opinions, but the board of trustees alone shall make the final decision regarding a disability claim. Nothing
herein shall be construed to require the board of trustees to request or use the services of the medical board as
regards a disability claim or claimant, it being within the board's discretion, with city approval, to make a final
decision in all such cases.
Payment for services of the medical board shall be determined by the board of trustees in all cases where such
services are requested by the board.

erroneously, fraudulently or illegally for any reason. Said board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any
person heretofore granted a pension under prior or existing law or hereafter granted under this division if the
same is found to be erroneous, fraudulent or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has been
heretofore under prior or existing law or who shall hereafter under this division be erroneously, improperly or
illegally classified.
5.

date of employment, six (6) percent of the member's basic compensation. Effective October 1, 2001, the city
shall pick-up, rather than deduct from each member's pay, beginning with the date of employment, seven (7)
percent of the member's basic compensation. Effective October 1, 2002, the city shall pick-up, rather than deduct
from each member's pay, beginning with the date of employment, eight (8) percent of the member's basic
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
135/653
compensation. Effective October 1, 2004, the city shall pick-up, rather than deduct from each member's pay,
beginning with the date of employment, nine (9) percent of the member's pensionable compensation. Effective
October 1, 2005, the city shall pick-up, rather than deduct from each member's pay, beginning with the date of
employment, ten (10) percent of the member's pensionable compensation. The monies so picked-up shall be
deposited in the Fund immediately after each pay period. An account record shall be maintained continuously
for each member. Pick-up contributions shall continue until death, disability or termination of service, whichever
shall occur first. Contributions shall remain in the Fund unless withdrawn as provided in the plan. No member
shall have the option to choose to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the
city directly to the plan. All such pick-up contributions by the city shall be deemed and be considered as part of
the member's accumulated contributions and subject to all provisions of the plan pertaining to accumulated
contributions of members. The intent of this provision is to comply with Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code. For the purpose of accruing and calculating pension benefits, Social Security benefits, overtime
compensation, percentage increases to base pay, supplemental percentage payments for particular assignments,
education, experience, longevity, years of service, payroll steps, licensure or training, and for paying Social
Security taxes, and for such other purposes except as specified in this plan, the amount of employee
contributions "picked-up" or paid by the city will be added to the amount distributed on a current basis in order
to determine total wages, salary, pay or compensation.
(b)
All benefits payable under this plan are in lieu of a refund of accumulated contributions. In any event, however,
each member shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits at least equal in total amount to the member's
accumulated contributions.
(c)
Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws of the State of Florida for the express purpose of
funding or paying for retirement benefits for police officers shall be deposited into the fund within five (5)
business days of receipt by the city. State monies shall be used to provide extra benefits to police officers over
and above those provided to general employees of the city.
(d)
The city shall make such contribution under the Florida Protection of Public Employee Retirement Benefits Act
and F.S. ch. 185, which together with contributions picked-up on behalf of members, plan earnings and state
insurance premium tax rebates, will maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis, as determined by the board in
conjunction with its actuary. The city's contributions shall be deposited at least quarterly.
(e)
Expenses, charges and fees attributable to the management of the plan shall be paid from the fund.
(f)
The city shall have no right, title or interest in the fund or in any part thereof, and no contribution made thereto
shall revert to the city, except such part of the fund, if any, which remains therein after the satisfaction of all
liabilities to persons entitled to benefits under the plan.

Sec. 2-79. - Service retirement benefit.
(a)
A Tier One member may retire on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of: the
date upon which the member completes twenty (20) years of credited service regardless of age; or the date upon
which the member attains age fifty-five (55) with five (5) years of credited service. A Tier One member shall
become fully vested after earning five (5) years of credited service. There shall be no mandatory retirement age.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Tier Two members shall be eligible to retire on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the date on which such member completes twenty-five (25) years of
credited service, regardless of age, or reaches age fifty-five (55) and completes seven (7) years of credited
service, whichever shall occur first.
(b)
Effective October 1, 2002, a normal retirement benefit shall be determined by multiplying three (3) percent of
final monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service. Effective October 1, 2004, a normal
retirement benefit shall be determined by multiplying three and one-half (3½) percent of final monthly
compensation by the number of years of credited service for all service accrued on or after October 1, 2001.
Effective October 1, 2009, a retirement benefit, for a member under Tier Two, shall be determined by
multiplying three (3) percent of final monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service, with a
maximum benefit payable of seventy-five (75) percent of final monthly compensation. Tier Two members shall
be allowed to purchase an increase in their multiplier up to three and one-half (3½) percent. The full actuarial
cost of purchasing an increase in the multiplier shall be borne solely by the participants as determined by the
plan actuary. Any enhanced multiplier benefit purchased shall not be subject to the seventy-five (75) percent of
final monthly compensation maximum benefit limitation however, a member's total benefit shall not exceed one
hundred (100) percent of final monthly compensation. For all members employed by the city as of April 25,
2011, years of service accrued prior to October 1, 2001 shall be determined by multiplying three and one-half
(3½) percent of final monthly compensation by the number of years of credited service for all service accrued
prior to October 1, 2001.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
138/653
(c)
A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day of each month. The benefit shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement. The service retirement
benefit shall be an unreduced life annuity with one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member
shall die prior to receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be paid to the
beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate
shall be the recipient of the remaining balance of payments. This shall be the normal form of retirement. In the
event that a member shall retire in the middle of the month, the retirement benefit shall commence on the first
day of the following month, but the member shall receive credit for the partial month preceding the actual date
that payment commenced.
(d)
Early retirement shall be available to a member on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
attainment of age fifty (50) and a completion of ten (10) years of credited service.
(e)
A member electing early retirement may receive either a deferred payment or an immediate payment under the
following formula:
(1)
A deferred payment shall commence on the normal retirement date of the member as defined in section 2-75 and
subsection (a) of this section. A deferred payment shall be determined in the same manner as a normal
retirement, except that final monthly compensation and credited service shall be based upon the early retirement
date.
(2)
An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the date of early retirement. The benefit shall be determined for normal retirement and then actuarially reduced
for the number of actual years and months at which the starting date of the benefit precedes the normal
retirement date as defined herein. The actuarial reduction factor applied to the benefit shall be three (3) percent
for each year by which the starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date.
(f)
The payment of the early retirement income shall be subject to the same conditions as normal retirement income.
(g)
In the event a member elects early retirement, the benefit formula in effect on the early retirement date shall be
applicable to the member.
(h)
A member entitled to a normal or early service retirement benefit shall have the right at any time prior to the
date upon which the first payment is received to elect to have the benefit payable under one (1) of the options
provided in this plan. A member shall be permitted to revoke any such election and to elect a new option at any
time prior to the receipt of the first payment. Each retirement option shall be the actuarial equivalent of the other
retirement options available. Election of the retirement option shall be on a form prescribed by the board.
(1)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
139/653
Life annuity. A member may elect to receive an enhanced annuity payable for life. There shall be no guaranteed
payment in excess of the accumulated contributions of the member, which contributions shall be paid to the
member's estate or designated beneficiary should the member die prior to receiving payments equal to said
contributions.
(2)
Joint and last survivor option. A member may elect to receive an actuarially reduced benefit for life and to have
the benefit (or a designated fraction of the benefit) continued after the member's death and during the lifetime of
a designated survivor. A designated survivor may be any natural person, but need not be the spouse of the
member. In the event that the designated survivor dies, or in the case of a spouse, the marriage is dissolved,
before the member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be canceled automatically and a retirement income
shall be payable to the member as if the election had never been made. A member may, at that time, elect an
unreduced life annuity or a ten (10) year certain and life thereafter benefit.
(3)
Other options. The retirees may, by uniform rule, establish any other optional form of payment, which is the
actuarial equivalent of any other form of retirement provided for in this plan, or which optional form of payment
is cost neutral to the plan. An interest only option or an option providing guaranteed payments over a period in
excess of twenty (20) years or beyond age eighty-five (85) may not be offered. The board, in its sole discretion,
may make a lump sum distribution which is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly benefit if the lump sum is
not greater than one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($1,750.00).
(4)
Designated beneficiary. Upon failure of a member to designate a beneficiary, any monies owed to the member
shall be paid to the member's estate. Any member may designate a choice of one (1) or more persons, named
sequentially or jointly, as his or her beneficiary or beneficiaries.

Sec. 2-80. - Buy-back for military or prior police service.
(a)
Any member of the plan who is employed by the city prior to entry into military service and who takes a leave
of absence for the purpose of entering into military service in the Armed Forces of the United States and
thereafter re-enters the employ of the city shall be entitled to receive service credits for the period of absence,
provided that the member returns to service with the city within one (1) year after release from military service.
(b)
A member who is receiving, or will receive the pension benefit for military service in any other pension plan
supported by public funds, may not use that service for this pension plan. A member who is receiving, or will
receive any other pension in which time served in the military was used by the employee in that other pension
plan shall not be eligible for military buyback as provided in this section.
(c)
Members of the plan may purchase up to a total of five (5) years credited service for prior service as a police
officer with any duly constituted police department, other eligible sworn law enforcement service, and/or for
military service in the Armed Forces of the United States, not credited under subsection (a) of this section. For
the time being purchased, the full actuarial cost of this buyback must be paid by the employee. The cost for the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
140/653
service buyback under this subsection may be made in one (1) lump sum or may be made by payroll deductions
in installments which shall not exceed ten (10) years. An employee making installment payments shall complete
all required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. If installment payments are not
completed at the time an employee retires, the employee shall not receive prior service credit for the remaining
period for which payments were not made. An employee making installment payments shall be assessed interest
at the rate eight (8) percent. Members, who commenced making installment payments for the purchase of
credited service on or before March 23, 2009, shall be assessed an interest rate of five (5) percent for the first
five (5) years, and eight (8) percent for the next five (5) years. Should an employee die prior to completing any
installment payments, the employee's designated beneficiary or joint annuitant shall be given the opportunity to
complete the buyback and receive the outstanding credited service by making one (1) lump sum payment of the
entire balance due within ninety (90) days of the date of the employee's death.
(d)
Any service purchased under this section may not total more than five (5) years when combined in the
aggregate. The plan actuary shall prepare all calculations related to the cost of any service buybacks under this
section. The fee charged by the actuary for the calculation shall be paid for by the city if the individual proceeds
with the buyback, otherwise the fee shall be paid by the individual.
(e)
Any and all service purchased under this section shall not count towards vesting under the plan.
(Ord. No. 00O-3-15, § 2, 5-8-00; Ord. No. 00O-12-85, § 1, 12-18-00; Ord. No. 03O-02-120, § 2, 4-28-03; Ord.

Sec. 2-81. - Disability.
(a)
A member shall be disabled under the terms of the plan if the member has suffered an illness, injury or disease
which renders the member permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular and
continuous duty as police officer. Disability shall not be determined based solely on the fact that a member
cannot perform all of the duties of a police officer as set forth in the job description. The definition of disability
shall be applied to an individual who because of illness, injury, or disease, cannot perform any job in the police
department which is within the member's physical or mental capabilities and further provided that a vacancy
exists which will be made available by the city. The city shall be required to accommodate disabled workers in
accordance with state and federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions on the basis that a
member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of a police officer.
(b)
A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability retirement from the entry date into the plan. A
service-incurred disability retirement shall mean that the disability arose as a result of an act occurring, or
presumed by law to have occurred, in the performance of service with the city.
(c)
A member shall be eligible for a non-service incurred disability retirement upon the completion of ten (10) years
of credited service. A non-service incurred disability shall be an illness, injury, or disease, which did not occur
as a result of an act in the performance of service with the city.
(d)
The service-incurred disability benefit shall be paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to the
member's accrued benefit, but not less than forty-two (42) percent of the member's final monthly compensation
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
141/653
as of the date of disability retirement.
(e)
The non-service incurred disability benefit shall be paid on a monthly basis in an amount equal to two percent of
final monthly compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service, but shall not be less than
twenty-five (25) percent of average monthly compensation. For the purposes of a non-service incurred disability
benefit, final monthly compensation shall be determined as of the last day the member was actively at work for
the city.
(f)
Disability benefits shall be paid on the first day of each month. No benefit shall be paid until the board of
trustees has actually considered and voted upon entitlement to disability.
(g)
Disability retirement income shall continue until the death of the member, or recovery from disability and return
to active police service. At the option of the member, a conversion of a service-incurred disability retirement
may be made to a normal service retirement with credited service for all years of disability based on the salary
applicable at time of disability. This election may be made for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days after the
member reaches normal retirement age and receives written notice of the right of election from the plan. In the
event of the death of a member who is retired on a disability benefit and has not received one hundred twenty
(120) payments, the remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to a designated beneficiary selected by the member
and communicated to the board on the form prescribed by the board. In the event that there is no designated
beneficiary, the remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. In the event a
member's disability is converted to a service retirement as set forth in this section, the member shall be accorded
credited service for the period of disability.
(h)
The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to require disabled members to submit to a medical
examination to determine that the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered, the
medical board must recommend to the board of trustees that the member has sufficiently recovered to again
engage in the duties of a police officer and that the city has certified that it has a position within the police
department available for the member consistent with the member's medical condition.
(i)
Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, the member shall return to work for the city at the same rank
and position previously occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which the member
would have occupied but for the disability. The member shall again become an active member of the plan and
shall receive, if reemployment is accepted, creditable service for any period of time in which the member was
receiving disability benefits. If the member declines reemployment with the city, the member shall be deemed to
have terminated employment on the date that the disability commenced. In such event, the member may receive
a return of contributions unless, prior to that date, the member has received disability benefits equal to or greater
than the amount of the accumulated contributions. If the member declines re-employment within the city, the
member shall be deemed to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit commenced.
(j)
No member shall be eligible to receive disability benefits from the retirement plan during any period of time that
the member is receiving a salary from the city. This section shall not apply to the receipt of worker's
compensation benefits.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
142/653
(k)
Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form prescribed by the board of trustees. The member
shall execute such medical releases as are necessary to permit the board of trustees to review the medical records
needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of an
application for disability, the board shall appoint a medical committee to be composed of not less than one (1)
nor more than three (3) licensed physicians. The applicant for disability shall be required to submit to
examination by the medical committee. The medical committee shall report its findings to the board of the
trustees which shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably possible, the origin of the disability,
whether the disability is permanent, and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the medical
committee shall be bound by the definition of disability set forth in this plan.
(l)
Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the trustees shall schedule a public hearing at which time
the board shall review all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary evidence as the
applicant may wish to submit. The board shall conduct a preliminary determination as to whether the member is
permanently and totally disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does not grant the
application based on the written documentation, it shall inform the member in writing of the reasons for the
denial of the application. The member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary denial,
request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing will be conducted consistent with the principles
of due process and the rules of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply. The
board shall have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance of witnesses. At said hearing the
applicant may present such oral and written evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish its burden of
proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine witnesses and to offer argument
in opposition to the application. The attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the
board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the right to examine and cross-examine all
witnesses. The decision of the board shall be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to
this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render an opinion in writing setting forth the
reasons for the grant or denial of the benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant shall
have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward
County.
(m)
The board of trustees may prescribe rules of procedure to implement the provisions of this plan relating to the
conduct of disability hearings.
(n)
No member shall be granted a disability pension upon a determination by the board that the disability resulted
from:
(1)
Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or narcotics;
(2)
Injury or disease sustained while wilfully and illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while
committing a crime;
(3)
Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while serving in the armed forces;
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
143/653
(4)
Injury or disease sustained by the police officer after employment has terminated; or
(5)
Injury or disease sustained by the police officer while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of
such employment.

Sec. 2-82. - Vesting and termination.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to benefits under this plan shall terminate when a
member's employment terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, early service retirement,
or disability retirement. Any Tier One member who completes five (5) years of credited service and whose
contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No Tier One member who
has completed less than five (5) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any accrued benefit. Any
Tier Two member who completes seven (7) years of credited service and whose contributions remain in the plan
has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No Tier Two member who has completed less than seven (7)
years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any accrued benefit.
(b)
A Tier One member who shall leave the service of the city prior to eligibility for normal service retirement or
early service retirement, but who has completed five (5) years of creditable service shall be entitled to receive
retirement benefits commencing at the regular normal or early service retirement date. A Tier Two member who
shall leave the service of the city prior to eligibility for normal service retirement or early service retirement, but
who has completed seven (7) years of creditable service shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits
commencing at a Tier Two member's regular normal or early service retirement date. Such benefits will be based
on final monthly compensation and credited service as of the date of termination.
(c)
Every member shall have the right to elect to receive, in lieu of all benefits under the plan, a return of the
member's accumulated contributions.
(d)
A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions releases and discharges the City of Lauderhill and the
retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan. A member who terminates service prior to
achieving a vested interest in the plan shall have the right to receive a refund of accumulated employee
contributions.
(e)
If a member who has terminated service prior to retirement reenters the police department, the member will be
entitled to reinstate the credited service that the member had on the date of termination in lieu of the benefits to
which the member became entitled at time of separation. If, at the time of separation, the member withdrew the
member's accumulated contributions, credited service can only be restored by repaying to the pension plan an
amount equal to the accumulated contributions plus five percent interest from the date the contributions were
withdrawn.

(Ord. No. 00O-3-15, § 2, 5-8-00; Ord. No. 00O-12-85, § 1, 12-18-00; Ord. No. 16O-06-121, § 2, 6-27-2016;
Ord. No. 19O-06-109, § 2, 6-24-2019)
Sec. 2-85. - Amendment or termination of the system.
(a)
It is the intention of the city and the board that this pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no
portion of the assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan, including the payment to
the last surviving member and beneficiary has been paid. No amendment shall result in members receiving lower
benefits than those in effect on the date the member commenced service with the city.
(b)
In the event of termination or partial termination of the plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall
become nonforfeitable (one hundred (100) percent vested) to the extent funded. At such time, the funds shall be
appropriated and distributed in accordance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 185.
In the event that the plan is terminated, the assets of the plan shall first be distributed to retired members and
their beneficiaries. If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment to retired members and their
beneficiaries, apportionment shall next be made to each member in the service who has completed at least ten
(10) years of credited service and has contributed to the fund for at least ten (10) years and who is not otherwise
eligible to retire. If there is any asset value after the apportionments to retirees and their beneficiaries and to
vested members of the plan, apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member in the service of the
city in an amount not to exceed the total value of the member's contributions. In the event that there is any asset
value remaining after full apportionment to all members and beneficiaries of the plan, the excess, if any, shall
revert proportionately to the city and the State of Florida on the basis of contributions to the plan.

Sec. 2-86. - Distribution of marital interests in the plan.
(a)
In the event that the board is served with a domestic relations order or other legal process purporting to require
the payment of any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a dissolution of marriage, the
board shall cause such order to be reviewed to determine compliance with the provisions of the plan.
(b)
The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure
that such domestic relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest in a public
employees retirement plan under state law.
(c)
Any cost associated with the modification or correction of such domestic relations orders shall be the
responsibility of the plan member and payment of any such cost shall be a condition precedent to the receipt of
benefits from the plan.

(a)
The present or future right of a person to money in the pension fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional
allowance, a death benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing under the
provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the
operation of bankruptcy or insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except with respect to
alimony, child support or medical payments to a former spouse or minor child.
(b)
The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension has been granted under any
prior or existing law or which may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or illegally for
any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any person who has been granted a pension
under a prior or existing law, or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this part if the granting of that pension
is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any
prior or existing law or who may under this part be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified.
(c)
Should any change or error in retirement system records be discovered or result in any member or beneficiary
receiving from the retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to receive had the
records been correct, the board shall have the power to correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the
payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or beneficiary was
correctly entitled shall be paid.
(d)
If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the
power to withhold payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to the board of the
appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that any member or beneficiary is incapable of
personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause notice
to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to determine whether said benefits should continue to
be paid until the appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however, the board may
continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that such payment shall be a complete discharge of
any liability under the plan for such payment.
(e)
Any person who willfully and knowingly makes, or causes to be made, or assists, conspires with, urges another
to make, or causes to be made, any fraudulent, or misleading oral or written statement or withholds or conceals
material information to obtain any benefit available under this plan shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, punishable under F.S. §§ 775.082 and 775.083. In addition to any applicable criminal penalty, any
beneficiary or participant in this plan who is convicted of this offense may, in the discretion of the board, be
required to forfeit any benefits payable under this plan. For the purposes of this section, the term "conviction"
shall mean a determination of guilt whether by plea or trial, whether or not adjudication is withheld.

Sec. 2-87.1. - Deferred retirement option plan.
(a)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
148/653
A deferred retirement option plan ("DROP") is hereby created.
(b)
Eligibility to participate in the DROP is based upon eligibility for service retirement in the plan.
(c)
The maximum period of participation in the DROP is five (5) years.
(d)
Upon exercising the right to participate in the DROP, an employee's credited service, accrued benefits and
earnable compensation calculation shall be frozen, and the best five (5) years out of the last ten (10) years of
employment immediately preceding participation in the DROP shall be utilized to determine benefits. For the
purpose of determining benefits for a Tier One DROP participant, the value of a member's pensionable accrued
holiday/incentive, vacation and sick time as of April 28, 2014, will be included based on the member's rate of
pay as of the earlier of the date the member enters the DROP or September 30, 2014, provided that the member
still maintains said leave at the time he/she enters the DROP.
(e)
Payment shall be made into the employee's DROP account in the amount which would be paid had the member
separated from the city and commenced normal retirement.
(f)
For the purpose of determining interest earned on a member's DROP account prior to April 28, 2014, an
employee's account in the DROP program shall earn interest at the same rate as the investment earnings
assumption for the plan (currently seven and three quarters (7.75) percent per year, compounded annually). The
investment earning assumption may be adjusted up or down during participation in the DROP, which would
result in a change in the prospective interest rate credit on the individual's DROP account. For the purpose of
determining interest earned on a member's DROP account on or after April 28, 2014, a member's DROP account
shall be credited (if applicable) at a rate of interest as set forth herein. The rate of interest that will be used is the
monthly actual rate of return achieved by the trust fund, positive or negative, net of investment and other direct
administrative expenses (the "actual rate of return"). Upon exiting the DROP, a participant's account cannot be
less than the sum of their monthly payments into the DROP during their DROP period. Members shall not have
the option of receiving a fixed amount in their DROP account for any period after April 28, 2014. Any member
who was eligible to enter the DROP as of April 28, 2014, shall have the option to earn interest on their DROP
account based on the pertinent provision of the plan that exists as of April 28, 2014, or based on the provisions
contained herein, but each such member must notify the city of the member's election between these options
within thirty (30) days of April 28, 2014.
(g)
An employee shall terminate service with the police department at the conclusion of five (5) years in the DROP.
(h)
No payment may be made from the DROP until the employee actually separates from service with the city.
Payments from the DROP shall be made within ninety (90) days of separation from service. Payment shall be
made either in a lump sum or may be rolled over to a qualified retirement plan that accepts the payment. At all
times, the DROP shall be subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(i)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
149/653
If an employee dies during participation in the DROP, the employee shall be treated as any other vested member
in the plan who dies prior to retirement.
(j)
Upon commencement of participation in the DROP, the member shall no longer be eligible for disability
retirement from the plan. If a member becomes disabled during the DROP period, the member shall be treated as
if he/she retired on the day prior to the date of disability.
(k)
The board shall adopt any administrative rules necessary to administer the DROP.
(Ord. No. 04O-11-230, § 6, 12-13-04; Ord. No. 05O-10-197, § 1, 11-28-05; Ord. No. 14O-09-152, § 3, 1-26-15;

Sec. 2-87.2. - Cost-of-living adjustment.
(a)
Cost-of-living adjustment created. A cost-of-living adjustment is hereby created beginning with persons who
retire on or after October 1, 2004. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be determined on an annual basis by the
board of trustees based upon the criteria set forth in this section and shall not constitute a vested benefit.
(b)
Cost-of-living adjustment calculated. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be based upon actuarial gains in the
plan. The funds required for the payment of any cost-of-living adjustment shall be derived solely from the
investment return of plan assets, both realized and unrealized, as allocable to police officers and beneficiaries
receiving benefits from the plan, and only in such amounts as exceeds the investment return assumed for
purposes of the actuarial valuation of the plan and a total experience gain for the plan as compared to the
actuarial assumptions.
(c)
Amount of the cost-of-living adjustment. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be in the form of a thirteenth check
which shall not exceed the regular monthly retirement benefit of the member. The benefit shall be paid following
the issuance of the actuarial valuation report and shall be based on the actuarial gains and losses as determined in
the actuarial report for the preceding year. Any payments under this section shall be expressed as a percentage of
the retiree's current benefit, and such percentage shall be uniform in respect to all retirees in any given year.
(d)
To whom cost-of-living adjustment is paid. When the cost-of-living adjustment is paid, it will be paid to all
members of Tier One, who retired and separated from city employment on or after October 1, 2004. The first
payment will be available in the first year following retirement and separation. Retirees whose payments start
during a fiscal year shall receive a pro rata payment reflecting the number of payments received in the year
immediately prior thereto divided by twelve (12). The board may adopt any administrative rules necessary to
administer the thirteenth check program. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, members of Tier Two shall
not be entitled to any cost-of-living adjustment, or any thirteenth check program.

ten dollars ($10.00) per month per year of service for all members employed by the city on or after April 25,

Pursuant to the requirements of F.S. § 185.35(6), a defined contribution plan ("DC Plan") is hereby created,
which DC Plan shall comply with the Internal Revenue Code if activated and funded. This DC Plan shall be a
component of the retirement plan and exist in conjunction with the defined benefit component that meets
minimum benefits and minimum standards.
(b)
The DC Plan shall not be activated unless and until a portion of premium tax revenues has been assigned to fund
the DC Plan as negotiated by the parties to the applicable bargaining unit contracts, or if mutual consent on the
use of premium tax revenues is not achieved and the statutory default is engaged pursuant to Chapter 2015-39,

Sec. 2-88.6. - Service retirement benefits; cost-of-living adjustments.
(a)
A member may retire on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of: the date upon
which the member completes twenty (20) years of credited service, regardless of age; or the date upon which the
member attains age fifty-five (55) with seven (7) years of credited service. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, a member hired after March 1, 2009, and on or prior to September 1, 2012, may retire on the first day
of the month coincident with or next following the earlier of: the date upon which the member completes twenty
(20) years of credited service regardless of age; or the date upon which the member attains age fifty-five (55)
with ten (10) years of credited service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a member hired after
September 1, 2012, and on or prior to March 25, 2019, may retire on the first day of the month coincident with
or next following the date upon which the member completes twenty-five (25) years of credited service
regardless of age. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, a member hired after March 25, 2019, may retire on
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date upon which the member attains age sixty
(60) with ten (10) years of credited service or the date upon which the member's age plus years of credited
service total seventy-five (75), whichever occurs earlier.
(b)
The normal retirement benefit shall be determined based upon the following percentages of final monthly
compensation multiplied by the applicable years and completed months of credited service:
Credited service prior to October 1, 1994, for members who participated in the General Employees Defined
Benefit Plan and who became members of the Confidential and Managerial Retirement Plan before September
30, 2002 ..... 3.0%
Credited service prior to October 1, 1994, for all other members ..... 2.5%
Credited service on or after October 1, 1994, but prior to October 1, 2004 ..... 3.0%
Credited service on or after October 1, 2004, but prior to October 1, 2019 ..... 3.5%
Credited service on or after October 1, 2019 ..... 3.0%
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the normal retirement benefit for members hired after March 1, 2009
and on or prior to September 1, 2012, shall be calculated as follows:
Credited service on or after March 1, 2009, but prior to October 1, 2019 ..... 3.0%
Credited service on or after October 1, 2019 ..... 2.75%
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the normal retirement benefit for members hired after September 1,
2012, and on or prior to March 25, 2019, shall be calculated using a two and one-quarter (2.25) percent
multiplier for each year of service.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the normal retirement benefit for members hired after March 25, 2019,
shall be calculated using a two (2) percent multiplier for each year of service.
(c)
A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day of each month. The benefit shall commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement and shall continue as
provided in the optional form of payment chosen by the member. In the event that a member shall retire in the
middle of the month, the retirement benefit shall commence on the first day of the following month, but the
member shall receive credit for the partial month preceding the actual date that payment commenced.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
160/653
(d)
Early retirement shall be available to a member on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
attainment of age fifty-five (55) and completion of fifteen (15) years of credited service.
(e)
A member electing early retirement may receive either a deferred payment or an immediate payment under the
following formula:
(1)
A deferred payment shall commence on the normal retirement date of the member. This shall mean the date
upon which the member attains age sixty-two (62) with seven (7) years of credited service. A deferred payment
shall be determined in the same manner as a normal retirement, except that final monthly compensation and
credited service shall be based upon the early retirement date.
(2)
An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the date of early retirement. The benefit shall be determined in the same manner as normal retirement and then
actuarially reduced for the number of actual years and months at which the starting date of the benefit precedes
the normal retirement date. The normal retirement date shall be the date upon which the member would have
attained age sixty-two (62) with seven (7) years of credited service. The actuarial reduction factor applied to the
benefit shall be one-fifteenth ( 1/15 ) for each of the first five (5) years and one-thirtieth ( 1/30 ) for each of the
next five (5) years by which the starting date of the benefit precedes age sixty-two (62).
(f)
The payment of the early retirement income shall be subject to the same conditions as normal retirement income.
(g)
In the event a member elects early retirement, the benefit formula in effect on the early retirement date shall be
applicable to the member.
(h)
The normal form of retirement shall be a life annuity. A member may, at that time, elect a life annuity, a ten-year
certain and life thereafter benefit, or appoint another survivor beneficiary.
The optional forms of benefit shall be as follows:
(1)
Joint and survivor option. A member may elect to receive a benefit for life and to have the benefit (or a
designated fraction of the benefit) continued after the member's death and during the lifetime of a designated
survivor. A designated survivor may be any natural person. In the event that the designated survivor dies before
the member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be canceled automatically and a retirement income shall
be payable to the member as if the election had never been made.
(2)
Ten-year certain and life thereafter. A member may elect to receive an unreduced life annuity with one hundred
twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to receiving one hundred twenty (120)
payments, the remaining benefits shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
161/653
beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient of the remaining balance of payments.
This shall be the normal form of retirement.
(3)
Pop-up option. For any survivorship benefit, the member may elect to purchase an option permitting the
substitution of a new survivor in the event of the death of the survivor or dissolution of marriage. The board, by
uniform rule, shall establish the cost and procedure for implementing this option. The cost of this option shall be
borne by the member.
(i)
The board shall be authorized to pay a non-recurring cost-of-living adjust to a retired member beginning in the
third year after retirement provided the plan has positive actuarial experience in the preceding fiscal year and the
amount of the cost-of-living adjustment does not exceed three (3) percent of the member's annual retirement
benefit in any given year.
(j)
Notwithstanding any provision in this part to the contrary, members eligible for an unreduced normal retirement
benefit may receive an in-service distribution provided any such distribution compiles with the applicable
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Regulations and guidance issued by the Internal Revenue
Service with respect to in-service distributions.
(1)
For the avoidance of any doubt, such members may elect to cease in-service distributions, at any time.
(2)
A member who ceases in-service distributions may restart participation in this retirement plan, to the extent they
otherwise qualify under the terms of this retirement plan, if contributions continue upon the member's re-entry,
in accordance with section 2-88.4, herein.
(3)
A member who ceases in-service distributions and restarts participation in this retirement plan may receive
credited service for their period of in-service distribution, in each case, if and only if, upon their re-entry into
this retirement plan, the value of contributions that would have been paid during the member's period of inservice
distributions are paid by the member to the plan. The time and method of payment of contributions under
this paragraph shall be determined by the board in accordance with uniform administrative rules adopted by the
board for such purpose.
(4)
In accordance with the intent of Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of the Treasury Regulations, in no event shall a member
who restarts participation in this retirement plan under this section 2-88.6(j) be permitted to restart in-service
distributions.
(5)
At the time of a member's service retirement, when he or she ceases active membership and severs employment
with the city, such member's retirement allowance and benefit, determined in each case in accordance with
section 2-88.6 herein, shall be reduced by the equivalent of the pro rata monthly share of the sum of in-service
distributions received by the member, based upon the member's life expectancy utilizing the mortality table in
effect at the time the member separates from the city.

Sec. 2-88.7. - Vesting and termination; purchase of prior covered service.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to benefits under this plan shall terminate when a
member's employment terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, early retirement, or
disability retirement. Any member who completes seven (7) years of credited service and whose contributions
remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member who has completed less than
seven (7) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any accrued benefit. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, a member hired after March 1, 2009 who completes ten (10) years of credited service and whose
contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member hired after
March 1, 2009 who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any
accrued benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any elected official who completes five (5) years of credited
service and whose contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan.
(b)
A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to eligibility for normal service retirement or early
service retirement, but who has completed not less than seven (7) years of creditable service shall be entitled to
receive retirement benefits commencing at the attainment of age sixty-two (62). Such benefits will be based on
final monthly compensation and credited service as of the date of termination. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, a member hired after March 1, 2009 who completes ten (10) years of credited service and whose
contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member hired after
March 1, 2009 who has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any
accrued benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an elected official who shall leave the service of the city prior to
eligibility for normal service retirement or early service retirement, but who has completed not less than five (5)
years of creditable service shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits commencing at the attainment of age
fifty-five (55).
(c)
Every member shall have the right to elect to receive, in lieu of all benefits under the plan, a return of the
member's accumulated contributions, with interest, at the rate of three (3) percent, compounded annually.
(d)
A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions releases and discharges the City of Lauderhill and the
retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan.
(e)
In no instance shall a member's benefits from the plan be less than the value of the employees contributions,
with interest.
(f)
Members may purchase up to five (5) years of credited service at an accrual rate of a three (3) percent multiplier
by tendering the employee and employer contributions as determined by the actuary for the plan. The city shall
pay the balance of any cost of the service being purchased in the preceding sentence as determined by the
actuary. A member must make an election to purchase this credited service by April 1, 2006. No member(s) shall
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
163/653
be entitled to elect to or purchase credited service after April 1, 2006. Confidential/managerial employees that
are members of the 401(a) or 457 plan may purchase credited service back to October 1, 1994, at an accrual rate
of a two and five-tenths (2.5) percent multiplier. Employees in a 401(a) account may transfer their entire account
balances and receive credit for years of service to October 1, 1994, or date of hire, whichever is later. Employees
in a city contributed 457 account may transfer assets equal to the city's contributions, plus gains and losses to be
determined by the actuary, and receive credit for the years of service to October 1, 1994, or date of hire,
whichever is later; provided that an amount equal to the employee contribution portion of the cost must be made
from an alternate source. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, confidential/managerial employees
shall be provided a one-time option, which option expires on April 1, 2006, to purchase credited service back to
their date of hire, at an accrual rate of a two and five-tenths (2.5) percent multiplier, provided that the member
tenders the refunded employee contributions plus cumulative interest at an agreed-upon rate. For the limited
purpose of the buyback provision set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, members electing the onetime
buyback option shall be permitted to cash in up to forty-five (45) days of vacation and sick time at their full
value to pay for the buyback. The member must maintain a balance of two hundred twenty-five (225) hours of
sick time while employed. No balance is required to be maintained for vacation time. The cost for the service
buyback under this subsection may be made in one (1) lump sum or may be made in installments. An employee
making installment payments shall complete all required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this
section. If installment payments are not completed at the time an employee retires, the employee shall not
receive prior service credit for the remaining period for which payments were not made. Upon separation from
employment with the city, a member may either use all or a portion of the two hundred twenty-five (225) hours
of sick time to complete a buyback under this section, and/or rollover all or a portion of the sick time to a
qualified retirement plan. Should an employee die prior to completing any installment payments, employee's
designated beneficiary or joint annuitant shall be given the opportunity to complete the buyback and receive the
outstanding credited service by making one (1) lump-sum payment of the entire balance due within ninety (90)
days of the date of the employee's death. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, effective March 1, 2009,
members may purchase up to five (5) years of credited service at an accrual rate of a three (3) percent multiplier
by tendering the full actuarial cost of the credited service. The purchase may be made by lump-sum payment or
in installment payments with interest at eight (8) percent. The lump-sum payment must be made within sixty
(60) days from receipt of the actuarial calculation determining the cost of the service to be purchased. If making
installment payments, the period of the installment payments must be affirmatively selected by the member. A
member making installment payments shall complete all required payments prior to payment of any benefit
under this section. If installment payments are not completed at the time a member retires, the member shall not
receive prior service credit for the remaining period for which payments were not made.
(g)
Members of the General Employees Retirement System shall receive credited service in this plan for all service
in a covered position as of the date of the adoption of the plan.

(a)
In the event that a member enters this plan as a result of appointment from a position covered by the general
employees retirement plan or the city's 401(a) plan, the member shall continue to accrue credited service in the
prior plan as well as earning credited service in this plan; provided however, that there shall be an offset of
benefits and contributions.
(b)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
164/653
If a member of this plan is reassigned to a position covered by the general employees plan or the city's 401 plan,
benefit accrual in this plan shall cease, but vesting credit shall continue to accrue in both this plan and the plan to
which the former member has transferred.
(c)
This plan, the City of Lauderhill Confidential and Managerial Employees' Retirement Plan, will coordinate
benefits with the general employees' pension fund. In the event that a participant of this plan has earned a
minimum of seven (7) years of aggregate service in this plan or the general employees' pension fund, the
participant shall be eligible for coordination of benefits from the two (2) plans, to the extent of any service credit
accrued in such plans. Upon the commencement of a service retirement, the participant shall receive payment
from this plan in an amount equal to the credited service accrued. In addition, the participant shall also be
eligible for payment from the general employees' pension fund, as appropriate, of a benefit equal to the years of
credited service in that plan based upon the salary in effect at the time the participant terminated service with the
city. The benefits in the general employees' pension fund shall be available even though the participant shall not
have vested under the terms of that plan.
(d)
In the event a participant of this plan shall transfer from this plan to the general employees' pension fund, and the
participant shall have accrued a total of seven (7) or more years of aggregate credited service in this plan and the
general employees' pension fund, the participant shall, upon retirement from the general employees' pension
fund, be deemed vested in this plan and eligible to receive benefits accrued in this plan up to the date of
termination, based on the salary and in an amount in effect on the date of transfer. This benefit shall be available
even though the participant shall not have achieved a vested benefit in this plan; provided, however, that the
participant, upon termination in this plan, kept his/her contributions on deposit in this plan.
(e)
The normal retirement date for a participant with an aggregate of seven (7) or more years of service credit from
this plan or the general employees' pension fund, shall be the normal retirement date of the participant's current
plan.

Sec. 2-88.9. - Disability.
(a)
Eligibility period. The eligibility requirements for service-incurred and nonservice-incurred disability benefits
for all members shall be as follows:
Service-incurred: Eligible from entry date as a member of the fund.
Nonservice-incurred: Seven (7) years of continuous service in the fund.
(b)
Disability-benefit, duration and amount. Any member otherwise eligible as stated above who receives a service
or nonservice incurred injury, illness, disease or disability, and which illness, injury, disease or disability
permanently incapacitates the member physically or mentally from regular and continuous duty as an employee
shall receive a disability benefit. The benefit shall commence following the expiration of benefits provided by
the city due to such disability, other than social security and worker's compensation, and shall continue until the
earlier of death or recovery from such disability. In the event of recovery prior to the otherwise normal
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
165/653
retirement date, credit for service during the period of disability shall be granted for purposes of subsequent
retirement benefits.
If a member is collecting disability income from the pension fund, at age sixty-two (62), the member shall have
the option of converting the disability to a normal retirement benefit provided he/she continues to meet all
eligibility requirements. Credit for service during the period of disability shall be granted for purposes of
retirement benefits.
The benefit shall be calculated as follows:
For service- and nonservice-incurred disabilities, the monthly benefit shall be the greater of:
(1)
Twenty (20) percent of the rate of monthly earnings in effect on the date of disability; or
(2)
The monthly benefit accrued to date of disability.
(3)
Total benefits paid (i.e., disability, worker's compensation, Social Security) shall not exceed one hundred (100)
percent of an employee's salary.
(c)
Determination of disability, board decision. No disability benefit shall be granted except upon approval of and
certification by the board of trustees that such disability was service or nonservice-incurred, that such disability
has been substantiated medically to the satisfaction of the board and that the member cannot perform his regular
duties.
(d)
Other available city employment. If the city provides or makes available any city job or position which can be
undertaken and performed by a disability retiree at any time during the period of disability, such job or position
must be accepted and fulfilled by such disability retiree unless the board, pursuant to established procedures,
determines that such disability retiree is unable to perform such job or position. If such employment is not
accepted by the disability retiree, the board shall forthwith terminate all disability benefits until such time as
such alternative employment is accepted. If such employment is accepted, the disability benefit shall be reduced
by fifty (50) percent of the amount payable, provided that in no event shall the disability benefit be reduced to a
level where the resulting total monies payable to the disability retiree (disability payment plus employment
compensation) be less than seventy (70) percent of the earnings in effect for such retiree on the date of disability.
Provided, further, any job or position offered to a disabled retiree shall constitute employment commensurate
with the ability of and the previous position occupied by such disability retiree. No member or former member
shall be forced or required to fulfill a position, job or employment of any type with the city which would fail to
recognize the prior established ability and position of such disabled person. In the event of an irreconcilable
situation arising as a result of an unsuitable position being offered to a disabled retiree, such retiree may, upon
application, have the matter finally resolved by the city manager with the decision of the city manager in any
such case to be final and binding on the disabled retiree, the city and the board of trustees of the retirement
system.
(e)

Required reexamination of disability retirees. Any service or nonservice-incurred disability retiree may be
required by the board to undergo a reexamination annually in order to confirm the continued existence of the
disability condition. Any refusal by a member to undergo such examination or reexamination shall result in a
termination of disability payments until such disability condition is again medically substantiated to the
satisfaction of the board.
(f)
Additional provisions re disability retirees.
(1)
Exclusions. Disability benefits shall not be payable in cases where the disability arose as a result of the member's
own willful intent or self-inflicted injury, intoxication, or use of narcotics or other items considered to be
dangerous drugs, or commission of a criminal act.
(2)
Recovery. In the event of recovery from disability as determined by the board, and immediate reemployment by
the city, the period of time while disabled shall be included as continuous service. In the event of recovery, but
without immediate reemployment by the city, the member's future benefits shall be determined as though he
initially terminated employment on the date of disability; provided, however, if such reemployment is prevented
by reason of the failure or refusal of the city to provide or offer acceptable employment, giving due
consideration to the then ability and capacity of such recovered disability retiree; and provided, also, that such
failure of reemployment is not caused by reason of such former retiree's failure or refusal to accept suitable city
employment; then, and in such event, the former disability retiree shall be entitled to future retirement benefits
computed and determined on a basis allowing for continuous service throughout the period of disability. In the
event of an irreconcilable situation arising hereunder, the matter shall be resolved by the city manager.
(g)
Presumptive disease. Any presumption created by general or special act of the state legislature creating a
presumption that certain illnesses have occurred in the line of duty shall be applicable for the purpose of
establishing causation for service-connected disability or death benefits under this plan. The presumptive disease
laws in effect on the date of a member's application for disability or death benefits shall be the presumptions
utilized by the board in considering that member's application for benefits.
(Ord. No. 02O-09-165, § 1, 12-9-02)
Sec. 2-88.10. - Death benefits.
(a)
In the event of the death of a member, whether or not vested in the plan, from a cause arising in the course of the
member's employment with the city, the member's designated beneficiary shall receive a benefit equal to twenty
(20) percent of the member's final monthly compensation until the death of the designated beneficiary. If there is
no surviving designated beneficiary, or if the surviving designated beneficiary dies, then payment shall be made
to the children of the member, then under the age of eighteen (18) years, in equal shares, until the youngest of
them shall reach the age of eighteen (18). The benefit shall be divided equally among the surviving children who
are under the age of eighteen (18) years. If the member is not survived by the designated beneficiary or child
under the age of eighteen (18), the benefit provided in this section shall be payable in the form of a ten (10) year
certain benefit to the member's estate.
(b)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
167/653
In the event of the death of a member, who is eligible for early or normal retirement, from a cause other than the
course of the member's employment with the city, the member's designated beneficiary shall be paid a benefit
equal to a fifty (50) percent joint and survivorship option until the death of the beneficiary. If the member has
not designated a beneficiary, the member's surviving spouse, if any, shall be deemed the member's beneficiary. If
the member has not designated a beneficiary and there is no surviving spouse, the member's minor children, if
any, shall receive a ten (10) year certain benefit, in equal shares, until the youngest of them shall reach age
eighteen (18); provided, however, that if one hundred twenty (120) payments have not been received, the benefit
shall continue until the one hundred twentieth payment. If no beneficiary has been designated and the member is
not survived by a spouse or minor children, the benefit provided in this section shall be payable to the member's
estate as a lump sum of the present value of a ten (10) year certain benefit.
(c)
In the case of a death or disability occurring on or after January 1, 2007, if a member dies while performing
qualified military service, the survivors of the member are entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit
accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the plan as if the member had
resumed and then terminated employment by the city on the account of death.
(d)
In the event of the death of a retiree, death benefits, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the optional form of
benefit chosen at the time of retirement.

year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70½), or April 1 of the year following the calendar
year in which the member retires. All distributions from the plan (including the DROP) shall conform to the
regulations issued under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, including the incidental death benefit
provision of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Internal Revenue Code. Further, such regulation shall override any plan
or DROP provision that is inconsistent with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
When a distribution of the participant's entire interest is not made in a lump sum, the distribution will be made in
one (1) or more of the following ways; over the life of the participant; over the life of the participant and
designated beneficiary; over a period certain not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant; or over
a period certain not extending beyond the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a
designated beneficiary.
(d)
If the distribution has commenced before the participant's death, the remaining interest will be distributed at least
as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the participant's death.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
168/653
The method of distribution, if the participant dies before distribution is commenced, must satisfy the following
requirements:
(1)
Any remaining portion of the participant's interest that is not payable to a beneficiary designated by the
participant will be distributed within five (5) years after the participant's death;

(e)
Direct transfers of eligible distributions shall be made as follows:
(1)
General. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any
provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible
rollover distribution made directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2)
Definitions.
a.
Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the
balance to the credit of a distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any
distribution that is one of a series of a substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the
distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and
the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. Effective for distributions made after
December 31, 2001, a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income. However, such portion
may be paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity under section 408(a) or (b) or a defined
contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so
transferred, including separately accounting for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the
portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not
so includible.
b.
Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section
408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust
described in Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code that accepts a distributee's eligible rollover
distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, an eligible retirement
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
169/653
plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions made after
December 31, 2001, for purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this plan, an eligible retirement plan shall
also mean an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the IRS Code and an eligible plan described in
section 457(b) of the IRS Code which is maintained by a state, a political subdivision of a state or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred to such plan from this plan. The definition of eligible Retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a
surviving spouse.
c.
Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former
employee's surviving spouse is a distributee with regard to the interest of the spouse. Effective as of January 1,
2008, an employee's or former employee's non-spouse beneficiary is a distributee with regard to the interest of
the employee or former employee.
d.
Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible Retirement plan specified by the
distributee. Effective as of January 1, 2008, a non-spouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover only to an
"inherited" individual retirement account as described in Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. If a nonspouse
beneficiary receives a distribution from the plan, the distribution is not eligible for a 60-day (non-direct)
rollover.
e.
In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the plan, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the
plan to the contrary, for the plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, the annual compensation of each
employee taken into account under the plan shall not exceed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(OBRA '93) annual compensation limit. The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, as adjusted by
the Commissioner for increases in the cost-of-living in accordance with § 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue
Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the annual compensation limit under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17),
as amended by OBRA '93, shall not apply to any eligible participant, in any future year, to the extent that the
application of the annual compensation limit in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17), as amended by
OBRA '93, would reduce the amount of annual compensation that is allowed to be taken into account under the
fund below the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the fund as in effect on July 1, 1993. As
used in this subdivision, "eligible participants" includes all members who participated in the fund prior to July 1,
1996.
f.
Notwithstanding any provision in this plan to the contrary, effective as of December 12, 1994, contributions,
benefits and service credit with respect to Qualified Military Service will be provided in accordance with
Section 414(u) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, USERRA Chapters 175 and 185, Florida
Statutes.

Sec. 2-88.12. - Amendment or termination of the system.
(a)
It is the intention of the city and the board that this pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no
portion of the assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan, including the payment to
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
170/653
the last surviving member and beneficiary has been paid. No amendment shall result in members receiving lower
benefits than those in effect on the date the member commenced service with the city.
(b)
In the event of termination or partial termination of the plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall
become nonforfeitable (one hundred (100) percent vested).
In the event that the plan is terminated, the assets of the plan shall first be distributed to retired members and
their beneficiaries. If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment to retired members and their
beneficiaries, apportionment shall next be made to each member in the service who has completed at least seven
(7) years of credited service and has contributed to the fund for at least seven (7) years and who is not otherwise
eligible to retire. If there is any asset value after the apportionments to retirees and their beneficiaries and to
vested members of the plan, apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member in the service of the
city in an amount not to exceed the total value of the member's contributions. In the event that there is any asset
value remaining after full apportionment to all members and beneficiaries of the plan, the excess, if any, shall
revert to the city.
(Ord. No. 02O-09-165, § 1, 12-9-02)
Sec. 2-88.13. - Distribution of marital interests in the plan.
(a)
In the event that the board is served with a domestic relations order or other legal process purporting to require
the payment of any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a dissolution of marriage, the
board shall cause such order to be reviewed to determine compliance with the provisions of the plan.
(b)
The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure
that such domestic relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest in a public
employees retirement plan under state law.
(c)
Any cost associated with the modification or correction of such domestic relations orders shall be the
responsibility of the plan member and payment of any such cost shall be a condition precedent to the receipt of
benefits from the plan.
(Ord. No. 02O-09-165, § 1, 12-9-02)
Sec. 2-88.14. - Miscellaneous.
(a)
The present or future right of a person to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death benefit, the
return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing under the provisions of this plan shall not be
assignable and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or
insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except with respect to alimony, child support or medical
payments to a former spouse or minor child.
(b)
The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon which any pension has been granted under any
prior or existing law or which may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or illegally for
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
171/653
any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls of any person who has been granted a pension
under a prior or existing law, or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this part if the granting of that pension
is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason; and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any
prior or existing law or who may under this part be erroneously, improperly or illegally classified.
(c)
Should any change or error in retirement system records be discovered or result in any member or beneficiary
receiving from the retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to receive had the
records been correct, the board shall have the power to correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the
payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or beneficiary was
correctly entitled shall be paid.
(d)
If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the
power to withhold payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to the board of the
appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that any member or beneficiary is incapable of
personally receiving and giving a valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause notice
to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to determine whether said benefits should continue to
be paid until the appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however, the board may
continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that such payment shall be a complete discharge of
any liability under the plan for such payment.
(e)
Differential wage payments. For years beginning after December 31, 2008, (i) an individual receiving a
differential wage payment, as defined in Section 3401(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be treated as an
employee of the employer making the payment, (ii) the differential wage payment shall be treated as
compensation, and (iii) the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision
described in Section 414(u)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code by reason of any contribution or benefit which
is based on the differential wage payment.
(Ord. No. 02O-09-165, § 1, 12-9-02; Ord. No. 18O-01-102, § 1, 1-29-2018)
Sec. 2-88.15. - Deferred retirement option plan.
(a)
A deferred retirement option plan ("DROP") is hereby created.
(b)
Eligibility to participate in the DROP is based upon eligibility for service retirement in the plan.
(c)
The maximum period of participation in the DROP is five (5) years.
(d)
Upon exercising the right to participate in the DROP, an employee's credited service, accrued benefits and
earnable compensation calculation shall be frozen, and the best five (5) years of employment out of the last ten
(10) years of employment preceding participation in the DROP shall be utilized to determine benefits.
(e)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
172/653
Payment shall be made into the employee's DROP account in the amount which would be paid had the member
separated from the city and commenced normal retirement.
(f)
The employee's DROP account shall earn interest at the same rate as the actual investment earnings of the plan.
Should the investment earnings for any year be negative, the member's account shall not gain or lose interest for
that year. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, members hired after March 1, 2009, who enter the DROP
shall have their account earn interest at the same rate as the actual investment earnings of the plan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, members hired after September 1, 2012, who enter the DROP shall
have their account earn or lose interest at one-half the rate of the actual investment earnings or losses of the plan,
said rate to be no more than five (5) percent, or less than zero.
(g)
As a condition of participating in the DROP, an eligible member who is not a member of the city commission or
a Charter officer must agree to terminate city employment at the conclusion of five (5) years and to submit an
irrevocable letter of resignation stating this prior to entering the DROP. Eligible members who are city
commissioners or Charter officers shall not be required to terminate city employment at the conclusion of the
DROP period, and may elect to resume participation in and accrue additional benefits in the City of Lauderhill
Confidential and Managerial Employee Defined Benefit Retirement Plan.
(h)
No payment may be made from the DROP until the employee actually separates from service with the city.
Payments from the DROP shall be made within thirty (30) days of separation from service. Payment shall be
made either in a lump sum or may be rolled over to a qualified retirement plan that accepts the payment. At all
times, the DROP shall be subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(i)
If an employee dies during participation in the DROP, the employee shall be treated as any other vested member
in the plan who dies prior to retirement.
(j)
Upon commencement of participation in the DROP, the member shall no longer be eligible for disability
retirement from the plan. If a member becomes disabled during the DROP period, the member shall be treated as
if he/she retired on the day prior to the date of disability.
(k)
The board shall adopt any administrative rules necessary to administer the DROP. Net investment return is
determined monthly by comparing the value of the assets in the fund on the first valuation date (i.e. the first date
of the month) to the value of the fund assets on the second valuation date (i.e. the last day of the month). Results
are geometrically linked, continuously, after the first month. A weighted average allocation method is used to
account for contributions into and payments from the fund. The weighted portion of such contributions and
payments is a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the valuation period, minus the number
of days in the valuation period which begin after the applicable payment date, and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the valuation period.

manager shall direct that all appropriate steps be taken to remedy it. Appeals may be brought to the city
commission for final determination. This process is not subject to arbitration.

welfare interests. The continuation of the bid award process under these circumstances shall not preempt or
otherwise affect the protest.
(e)
The bid protest bond shall compensate the city for the expenses of administering the protest. If the protest is
decided in the protestor's favor, the entire deposit shall be returned to the protester. If the protest is not decided in
the protester's favor, the deposit shall be forfeited to the city. The deposit shall be in the form of cash or a
cashier's check, and shall be the greater of one (1) percent of the amount of the pending award or five thousand

Sec. 2-212. - Procedures, power, duties.
The board shall hold a minimum of two (2) public hearings. By a majority vote of the members of the full board,
the board may submit a proposal to amend the charter to the city, if deemed necessary for any issue which would
require a referendum vote by the electors of the city in order to effectuate a charter amendment.
Any elector of the city who, in good faith, believes that an amendment should be made to the charter of the city
and who shall indicate his/her desires and recommendations in writing and shall have filed the same with the
city clerk may appear at any regularly scheduled public meeting of the board to be heard and to give evidence
concerning his/her recommendations. The board shall also hear the recommendations of the city commission,
city attorney, city manager or city clerk when presented. The board may, on its own initiative, review a particular
issue or section of the charter for possible amendment. The board shall include in its advisory reports a summary

228/653
The city clerk and the city attorney are hereby granted the authority to modify the proposed ballot language as to
form, but not as to substance, as may be required by the supervisor of elections to meet the form required to be
deemed to be an acceptable ballot question.
If the city commission adopts or amends the board's recommendations, the proposed ballot language shall be
placed on the municipal general election ballot in that same year; or, if no municipal general election is held in
that same year, then the city shall call a special election and have the ballot question placed on a county ballot
election in that same year.
The recommendations of the board do not preclude charter amendments for any issues which do not require a
referendum vote of the electors nor do they preclude any amendments that are deemed necessary by the city
commission during those years when no board is then currently serving. If a particular issue was not addressed
or contemplated by the board during its term, but it is determined by the city commission that the issue needs to
be added to the upcoming ballot, the city commission reserves the right to elect by a majority vote to place such
ballot question on the upcoming ballot.
In exercising its powers, the board shall perform the following:
(1)
Elect a chair and a vice-chair. The chair shall be responsible for the orderly running of all meetings, shall direct
the preparation of all reports and shall make all necessary reports to the city commission. The vice-chair shall
preside in the absence of the chair; and
(2)
Adopt such internal procedures and rules as may be necessary to carry out its duties; and
(3)
Consult with the city attorney as may be necessary to carry out its duties; and
(4)

sums as are necessary to carry out the duties of the board.

of three (3) successive meetings, without good cause, shall forfeiture his/her appointment and the city
commission may determine a vacancy to exist which shall be filled promptly in the same manner in which the
person was appointed. A member of the board may be removed from the board by the city commission, for
cause, upon written charges and after a public hearing before the city commission. Appointments to fill any
vacancy shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term of the former member.

Sec. 2-220. - Intent.
(a)
The city commission of the city finds and declares that safe neighborhoods are the product of planning and
implementation of appropriate environmental design concepts, comprehensive crime prevention programs, land
use recommendations, and beautification techniques.
(b)
The city commission of the city further finds and declares that Florida Statutes, Chapter 163 grants powers to
local governments to guide and accomplish the coordinated, balanced, and harmonious development of safe
neighborhoods; to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of these areas and their inhabitants, visitors,
property owners, and workers; to establish, maintain, and preserve property values and preserve and foster the
development of attractive neighborhood and business environments; to prevent overcrowding and congestion; to
improve or redirect automobile traffic and provide pedestrian safety; to reduce crime rates and the opportunities
for the commission of crime; and to provide improvements in neighborhoods so they are defensible against
crime.
(c)
It is the intent of the city commission of the city to implement plans that employ crime prevention through
community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space techniques
to establish safe neighborhoods.
(d)
The city commission, therefore, declares that the development, redevelopment, preservation, and revitalization
of neighborhoods in this city, and all the purposes of this article, are public purposes for which public money
may be borrowed, expended, loaned, and granted.
(e)
The city commission hereby adopts a local planning ordinance authorizing the creation of local government safe
neighborhood improvement districts pursuant to Florida Statutes Section 163.506 within the city.
(Ord. No. 09O-03-119, § 1, 4-13-09)
Sec. 2-221. - Purpose.
Safe neighborhood improvement districts are created for the purpose of crime prevention through community
policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space functions of
neighborhood improvement districts.
All special neighborhood improvement districts created pursuant to this part shall:
(1)
Collect data on the types, frequency, severity, and location of criminal activity occurring in the district, including
determination, from surveys and other research techniques, of the level of crime as perceived by neighborhood
residents and comparison of the types of crime in the district on a per capita, citywide, and countywide basis.

(2)
Provide an analysis of crimes related to land use and environmental and physical conditions of the district,
giving particular attention to factors which support or create opportunities for crime, which impede natural
surveillance, which encourage free circulation through the district, or which hinder the defense of social
territories perceived by residents as under control. Any factor used to define or describe the conditions of the
physical environment can serve as the basis of a crime-to-environment relationship. These factors include
streets, alleys, sidewalks, residential blocks, position of dwellings on a block, single vs. multifamily dwellings,
abandoned houses, parking areas and parking lots, informal pathways, functional areas of the environment,
traffic flow patterns, and the existence of barriers such as fences, walls, gullies, and thick vegetation.
(3)
Determine, from surveys and other data collection techniques, areas within the district where modification or
closing of, or restriction of access to, certain streets in a manner consistent with crime prevention through
community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space principles
would assist crime prevention and enhance neighborhood security for property owners and residents.
(4)
Formulate and maintain on a current basis for each district short-range and long-range projects and plans which
the crime-to-environment analysis, including surveys and citizen participation, has determined are applicable
and utilize crime prevention through community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental
security, and defensible space strategies and tactics which will improve the attractiveness and security of the
district by reducing criminal activity, will stabilize neighborhoods and enhance property values within the
district, will promote proper use and informal control of residential streets within the district, will improve
public facilities and amenities and provide for territorial control of streets and areas within the district by
legitimate users, and will increase the probability that persons who commit crimes in the district will be
apprehended.
(5)
Prepare and initiate actions deemed most suitable for implementing safe neighborhood improvement plans,
including modifications to existing street patterns and removal, razing, renovation, reconstruction, remodeling,
relocation, and improvement of existing structures and facilities, and addition of new structures and facilities,
and coordination with other agencies providing relevant informational, educational, and crime prevention
services. The preparation of actions for implementation shall utilize crime prevention through community
policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space strategies and tactics.
(6)
Participate in the implementation and execution of safe neighborhood improvement plans, including any
establishment, acquisition, construction, ownership, financing, leasing, licensing, operation, and management of
publicly owned or leased facilities deemed beneficial in effecting such implementation for the public purposes
stipulated in [F.S.] § 163.502.
(7)
Ensure that all capital improvements within the district are consistent with the capital improvement elements of
the applicable local government comprehensive plans.

policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space functions of
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
244/653
neighborhood improvement districts. All special neighborhood improvement districts created pursuant to this
part shall:
(1)
Collect data on the types, frequency, severity, and location of criminal activity occurring in the district, including
determination, from surveys and other research techniques, of the level of crime as perceived by neighborhood
residents and comparison of the types of crime in the district on a per capita, citywide, and countywide basis.
(2)
Provide an analysis of crimes related to land use and environmental and physical conditions of the district,
giving particular attention to factors which support or create opportunities for crime, which impede natural
surveillance, which encourage free circulation through the district, or which hinder the defense of social
territories perceived by residents as under control. Any factor used to define or describe the conditions of the
physical environment can serve as the basis of a crime-to-environment relationship. These factors include
streets, alleys, sidewalks, residential blocks, position of dwellings on a block, single vs. multifamily dwellings,
abandoned houses, parking areas and parking lots, informal pathways, functional areas of the environment,
traffic flow patterns, and the existence of barriers such as fences, walls, gullies, and thick vegetation.
(3)
Determine, from surveys and other data collection techniques, areas within the district where modification or
closing of, or restriction of access to, certain streets in a manner consistent with crime prevention through
community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space principles
would assist crime prevention and enhance neighborhood security for property owners and residents.
(4)
Formulate and maintain on a current basis for each district short-range and long-range projects and plans which
the crime-to-environment analysis, including surveys and citizen participation, has determined are applicable
and utilize crime prevention through community policing innovations, environmental design, environmental
security, and defensible space strategies and tactics which will improve the attractiveness and security of the
district by reducing criminal activity, will stabilize neighborhoods and enhance property values within the
district, will promote proper use and informal control of residential streets within the district, will improve
public facilities and amenities and provide for territorial control of streets and areas within the district by
legitimate users, and will increase the probability that persons who commit crimes in the district will be
apprehended.
(5)
Prepare and initiate actions deemed most suitable for implementing safe neighborhood improvement plans,
including modifications to existing street patterns and removal, razing, renovation, reconstruction, remodeling,
relocation, and improvement of existing structures and facilities, and addition of new structures and facilities,
and coordination with other agencies providing relevant informational, educational, and crime prevention
services. The preparation of actions for implementation shall utilize crime prevention through community
policing innovations, environmental design, environmental security, and defensible space strategies and tactics.
(6)
Participate in the implementation and execution of safe neighborhood improvement plans, including any
establishment, acquisition, construction, ownership, financing, leasing, licensing, operation, and management of
publicly owned or leased facilities deemed beneficial in effecting such implementation for the public purposes
stipulated in [F.S. §] 163.502.

(b)
Financial responsibility shall be evidenced by filing with the police department a certificate of insurance from an
insurance company authorized to do business in the State of Florida, valid for at least the one (1) year
registration period. The City of Lauderhill shall be listed as an additional insured and a certificate holder such
that the city will be notified if the insurance coverage expires or terminates. The city's risk manager is hereby
empowered to establish specific insurance requirements uniform to all dangerous dogs depending on the
insurance markets, from time to time, and will provide the owners of dangerous dogs with these requirements
within a reasonable time period upon written request. Proof of financial responsibility shall be a condition
precedent to the city's approving or re-approving the dog's registration.

the city holds securities (and stock or other powers appropriate to liquidate such securities) as an escrow agent.
The value of the escrow of cash and securities shall at all times be maintained in the minimum amount of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per dangerous dog. In the event at any time the escrow is reduced as provided
herein, it shall be a requirement that the value of the escrow be restored to its required minimum amount. In the

Sec. 7½-28. - Settlement, compromise, mitigation, or amendment of fines, liens.
(a)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
314/653
An aggrieved party (i.e. owner or legal representative of the property) may submit a written mitigation
application to the chief code enforcement officer of the code enforcement board to petition to waive, settle,
compromise, amend or otherwise modify an accumulated code enforcement fine to a lesser amount only for
those violations which have been brought into compliance by the code violator. The application must include a
two hundred fifty-dollar non-refundable application fee and must set forth the facts and circumstances in favor
of the application, as well as the amount, if any, offered in the compromise or settlement of code enforcement
fines and the original must be filed with the chief code enforcement officer. The chief code enforcement officer
will consider the application, testimony and information or documents submitted by either party and, after due
deliberation, the chief code enforcement officer shall have the right, duty, power, authority and jurisdiction to
recommend a settlement, compromise, mitigation, amendment or modification as he/she shall deem appropriate
for consideration and approval by the code enforcement board only for those cases in which the fine or claim of
lien/final order has not yet been recorded in the Official Public Records of Broward County. For all cases in
which the claim of lien/final order has already been recorded with Broward County in the official records book,
the authority and jurisdiction to settle, compromise, mitigate, amend or modify such recorded lien is not with the
code enforcement board, but rather shall be with the city manager, as is herein designated by the city
commission. The city attorney shall have the authority and jurisdiction to work in conjunction with the chief
code enforcement officer to recommend a settlement, compromise, mitigation, amendment or modification to the
code enforcement board for approval for unrecorded fines, claims of lien/final orders; and to the city manager
for approval of all recorded claims of lien/final orders. However, the code enforcement board must ratify the
recommendation of the chief code enforcement officer or city attorney for unrecorded fines and claims of
lien/final orders in order for it to become approved, effective, valid and final. The city manager must approve the
recommendation of the chief code enforcement officer or city attorney for recorded claims of lien/final orders in
order for it to become approved, effective, valid and final on behalf of the city governing body. Mitigation is a
privilege afforded by the city in its sole discretion and is not a right.
(b)
An aggrieved party may submit a written request for extension of time to the chief code enforcement officer
prior to the compliance date set forth in the final order of the code enforcement board to petition to extend the
compliance date set forth in the final order. The application must set forth the facts and circumstances in favor of
the application, as well as the amount of time, if any, being requested, and the original must be filed with the
chief code enforcement officer. The chief code enforcement officer will consider the application, testimony and
information or documents submitted by either party and, after due deliberation, the chief code enforcement
officer shall have the right, duty, power, authority and jurisdiction to recommend an amendment or modification
to the compliance date as he/she shall deem appropriate. The city attorney shall have the authority and
jurisdiction to work in conjunction with the chief code enforcement officer to recommend an amendment or
modification to the compliance date. However, the code enforcement board must ratify the recommendation of
the chief code enforcement officer or city attorney in order for it to become approved, effective, valid and final
with regard to compliance dates.

"Code enforcement officer" means any designated employee or agent of the city whose duty it is to enforce
codes or ordinances enacted by the city.
(b)
A code enforcement officer is authorized to issue a citation to a person, or post notice on a property, when the

315/653
(c)
If a violation is not open and obvious or in plain view, but the code enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a code violation exists, and the owner or possessor of the property upon which such violation is
believed to exist refuses to consent to an inspection of the premises, then the code enforcement officer must first
obtain a search warrant or an administrative inspection warrant in accordance with F.S. ch. 933, as it currently
exists or may be amended from time to time, prior to entering upon such private property and inspecting the
premises for the violation. The inspection of the property shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions

Sec. 7½-37. - Code enforcement special master jurisdiction and authority.
(a)
The code enforcement special master ("special master") shall have the jurisdiction and authority to hear and
decide alleged violations of the following on a nonexclusive basis (consistent with F.S. § 162.22) as amended, to
be determined by the city:
(1)
The city zoning ordinances, the land development code as it exists today and as may be amended from time to
time, and all ordinances relating to the development, maintenance, use, construction or condition of real
property, building or structures within the city, and minimum housing standards.
(2)
All city building codes, including, but not limited to, the Florida Building Code.
(3)
All city fire codes and any other city ordinances to the extent permitted by law.
(4)
In addition to the powers and authority given to the code enforcement special masters for the city pursuant to
this chapter, the city may, in its discretion, exercise any powers given to municipalities or their special masters
by F.S. ch. 162, as may be amended from time to time.
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-38. - Enforcement procedure.
(a)
Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), if a violation of the codes is found, the code inspector shall notify
the violator and give him or her a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond
the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall schedule a hearing. The code inspector, through its
clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as
provided in F.S. § 162.12, to said violator. At the option of the code inspector, notice may additionally be served
by publication or posting as provided in F.S. § 162.12. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
317/653
violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to
the special master even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state.
(b)
If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a
reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation,
shall request a hearing before the special master. The special master, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a
hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to F.S. § 162.12. The case may be presented to the special master even
if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation
has been corrected, the special master retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the
payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or
her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the special master.
(c)
If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious
threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code
inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the special master and
request a hearing.
(d)
If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before a special master transfers ownership
of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall:
(1)
Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee.
(2)
Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code
enforcement proceeding received by the transferor.
(3)
Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the
applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding.
(4)
File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of
the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after the date of the
transfer.
A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttal
presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but
the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held.
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-39. - Conduct of hearing.
(a)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
318/653
Upon request of the code inspector, or at such other times as may be necessary, the special master shall schedule
a hearing. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The
local governing body shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the
special master.
(b)
Each case before the special master shall be presented by the local governing body attorney or by a member of
the administrative staff of the local governing body. If the local governing body prevails in prosecuting a case
before the special master, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the
special master and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under F.S. § 162.09(3).
(c)
A special master shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and
shall be recorded. The special master shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. Formal
rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the
proceedings.
(d)
At the conclusion of the hearing, the special master shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and
conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted herein.
The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed
and, under the conditions specified in F.S. § 162.09(1), the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if
the order is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records
of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the
violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation
concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in
the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order,
the special master shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that it shall be recorded in the public records.
A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-40. - Powers of special masters.
The special master shall have the power to:

Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by the sheriff of the county
or police department of the municipality.
(3)
Subpoena evidence to its hearings.
(4)
Take testimony under oath.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
319/653
(5)
Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into
compliance.
(6)
To exercise all authority as granted to special magistrates in F.S. § 162.03(2).
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-41. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens.
(a)
A special master, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the special master has not been
complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator
to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the
special master for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues,
beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector, in addition, if the
violation is a violation described in F.S. § 162.06(4), the special master shall notify the local governing body,
which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the
violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such
repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or
to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to
the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has
been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine.
If, after due notice and hearing, the special master finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it
may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b)(1).
(b)
(1)
A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first
violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may
include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). However, if the special master finds the violation to be
irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per
violation. A special master may impose additional fines to cover costs incurred by the city in enforcing its codes
and the costs of all repairs undertaken.
(2)
In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special master shall consider the following factors:
a.
The gravity of the violation;
b.
Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and
c.
Any previous violations committed by the violator.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
320/653
(c)
A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records
and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real
personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the
same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal
property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement
purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance
or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a
fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the local governing body, and the local governing body
may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the
filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the local governing body
attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued
interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is a
homestead under § 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not
apply to real property or personal property which is covered under § (4)(a), Art. X of the State Constitution.
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-42. - Duration of lien.
Liens shall have the duration as provided by law.
(Ord. No. 09O-01-102, § 1, 1-26-09)
Sec. 7½-43. - Notices.
Notices shall be given in compliance with F.S. § 162.12, as may be amended from time to time.

11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
323/653
less than two (2) years remaining on the unexpired term of the mayor, then the vice mayor shall serve until the
expiration of the regular term of the mayor.
If the vacancy occurs more than sixty (60) days prior to the next regular city election, and the term does not
expire at the next regular city election, then the vice mayor shall serve until the next regular city election, at
which time the city shall conduct an election for the position of mayor to fill the remaining unexpired balance of
the term of the mayor. At such time that the vice mayor serves as mayor, the commissioner who most recently

After causing the condition to be remedied, the director of the code enforcement division shall certify to the
finance department the expense incurred in remedying the condition and shall include a copy of the notice above
described and such expense shall be billed to the property owner and shall become payable within thirty (30)
days after which a lien and charge will be made upon the property, which lien shall be payable with interest at
the then current legal rate of interest per annum, from the date of such certification until paid. Such expenses
shall be determined by the director of the finance department and shall include any and all additional costs and
expenses incurred by the city, including, but not limited to, the direct costs of inspection and of monitoring the
property for repeat violations for three (3) months following the initial violation at the rate of one (1) hour per
month, billing, recording of the liens, satisfactions of said liens, mailing costs, all actual out-of-pocket expenses
and all other costs that may be incurred in connection with remedying the condition. The invoice sent to the
property owner shall contain a statement advising that a failure to pay the amount invoiced will result in the
imposition of a non-ad valorem assessment on their next available annual tax bill; shall advise that the property
is then subject to the sale of a tax certificate bearing interest by law at a rate as high as eighteen (18) percent per
annum if the non-ad valorem assessment is not paid as part of the tax bill on the subject property; and shall
further advise of the potential for the property to be sold and conveyed via tax deed if the tax certificate is not
redeemed by payment of the non-ad valorem assessment in full, plus interest, as required by Florida law. If the
owner fails or refuses to pay the full amount due on the invoice by September 30, then the total of any and all
related costs incurred in connection with remedying the conditions, including also any administrative fees
charged by the Broward County Property Appraiser or Broward County Tax Collector for placement on the
annual tax bill, may be assessed against the property on the next available annual tax bill. This assessment shall
constitute a lien upon the tax parcels so assessed equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county,
district or municipal taxes and non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall
be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims until paid. The lien for the nuisance abatement
assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city commission of its annual adoption of its non-ad
valorem assessment roll resolution and shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior
January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes, consistent with F.S. § 197.3632.
(3)
Such lien shall be enforceable in the same manner as a mortgage and may be satisfied at any time by payment
thereof, including accrued interest. Notice of such lien certified by the city clerk may be filed in the office of the
clerk of the circuit court and recorded among the public records of Broward County, Florida. The lien shall
become void twenty (20) years after the date of the execution of the notice of lien. Said lien, together with all
penalties imposed thereon, shall constitute, and are hereby imposed as, special assessment liens against the real
property aforesaid, and until fully paid and discharged, or barred by law, shall remain liens equal in rank and
dignity with the lien of city and county ad valorem taxes and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens,
encumbrances, titles and claims in, to or against the real property involved. The payment of all costs of
collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, penalties, and lien amounts is required before said lien shall be
discharged or satisfied. Said liens shall accrue interest at the then-current legal rate of interest per annum.

Sec. 12-3. - Certificate of use and local business tax receipt required; prohibition of unauthorized and illegal
businesses; penalty for violation; enforcement.
(a)
Purpose. The operation of businesses within the city without the safeguards associated with the filing of an
application for the issuance of a certificate of use and a local business tax receipt constitutes a danger to the
health, safety and welfare of the community. The city commission has determined that more effective
enforcement procedures are necessary to prevent the operation of a business in the city without first obtaining a
certificate of use and a local business tax receipt or paying a local business tax, as well as to prevent the
operation of businesses that are not authorized to be conducted within the city or are illegal. Owners of real
property who permit businesses to operate from their property without verification of a valid and current
certificate of use and local business tax receipt contribute to the proliferation of illegal business. An increase in
the penalty for operating a business without first obtaining a certificate of use and a local business tax receipt or
without paying a local business tax will have a greater deterrent effect on businesses operating illegally within
the city. This alternate enforcement procedure was adopted to maximize the administration's ability to enforce
the city's prohibition against conducting a business without proper application for a certificate of use and a local
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
380/653
business tax receipt and to encourage swift compliance with these requirements and to prevent the conducting of
businesses that are unauthorized or illegal within the city limits.
(b)
It shall be unlawful for any person, either directly or indirectly, to conduct any business that is illegal or is not
authorized within the city limits. Further, it shall be unlawful for any person, either directly or indirectly, to
conduct or enter into any legitimate and authorized business, profession or occupation within the city without
first:
(1)
Making application for and being issued a certificate of use and a local business tax receipt by the city;
a.
If the real property which is to be used for the operation of a business is subject to unpaid city liens, fines, fees,
or code violations the city shall not issue or renew a certificate of use until such time as all liens, fines or fees on
the property are fully paid, including interest due and any assessable costs and until all code violations are
brought into compliance.
(2)
Paying all required local business taxes and associated fees;
(3)
Paying renewal local business taxes and filing necessary documentation to obtain timely renewal of both its
certificate of use and its local business tax receipt, as well as paying all annual fire inspection fees; or
(4)
Allowing by lease, license, grant, or other written or oral agreement, the use of any real property for the
operation of a business without a valid and current certificate of use and local business tax receipt.
(c)
In addition to the penalties set forth in section 12-33 of the Code, the following methods of enforcement shall be
available to the administration for the enforcement of this Code:
(1)
Any person required to secure a certificate of use who fails to secure a certificate of use required by this section
or any other ordinance of the city or law of the state shall, after receipt of not less than ten (10) days written
notice, be subject to closure of the facility or location at which a business unlawfully operates until such time as
a certificate of use and a local business tax receipt shall be secured for such location or facility in accordance
with this section. Any person, firm, or corporation which is closed by the city in accordance with this section
shall have the right to a due process hearing consistent with the procedures described in section 12-7.
(2)
Any person, corporation, or partnership which owns real property in the city and which by lease, license, grant
or other written or oral arrangement permits any person to operate a business without a valid and current
certificate of use and local business tax receipt shall be subject to a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per
day for each day that the business operates on the property without a valid and current certificate of use and
local business tax receipt.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
381/653
(3)
The specific penalties and enforcement mechanisms contained within this article are not exclusive remedies and
shall not be construed as prohibiting the city from seeking other fines and other remedies authorized by city,
state, federal, or common law.
(4)
Each day on which a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation for the purpose of determining the fine.
(5)
Any violation shall constitute a nuisance which may be brought before the nuisance abatement board. In
addition, the city attorney may bring suit on behalf of the city, or any affected citizen may bring suit in his/her
name against the person or persons causing or maintaining the violation, or against the owner/agent of the
building or property on which the violation exists. Relief may be granted according to the terms and conditions
of F.S. ch. 60, entitled Abatement of Nuisances, or as otherwise authorized by law.

(b)
On October 1 of each year, the city shall notify each business, profession, occupation, entity or individual that
has not paid the required local business tax that, if the required local business tax and all applicable penalties are
not paid by December 1, the city may impose a lien against such entity name and/or real property (where

fees, fines and penalties due, in addition to actual recording costs, mailing costs and additional fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the city in connection with staff preparation of the lien and/or release. Said lien, together
with all penalties, fees and costs imposed thereon, shall constitute, and are hereby imposed as, special
assessment liens against the entity name and/or the real property (where applicable) until fully paid and
discharged or barred by law, shall remain liens equal in rank and dignity with the lien of city and county ad
valorem taxes and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in, to or against
the real property involved. The payment of all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, collection
company fees, penalties, and lien amounts is required before said lien shall be discharged or satisfied. Said liens
shall accrue interest at the then-current legal rate of interest per annum. For residential businesses that have not
timely paid the required local business tax receipts and/ or certificates of use by September 30, where the
business owner is the same as the property owner, the city may bill all outstanding amounts due on the upcoming
annual tax bill for the property where the business is conducted. The local business tax receipt invoice sent to the
property owner shall contain a statement advising that a failure to pay the amount invoiced will result in the
imposition of a non-ad valorem assessment on their next available annual tax bill; shall advise that the property
is then subject to the sale of a tax certificate bearing interest by law at a rate as high as eighteen (18) percent per
annum if the non-ad valorem assessment is not paid as part of the tax bill on the subject property; and shall
further advise of the potential for the property to be sold and conveyed via tax deed if the tax certificate is not
redeemed by payment of the non-ad valorem assessment in full, plus interest, as required by Florida law. If the
owner fails or refuses to pay the full amount due on the invoice by September 30 then the total of any and all
taxes, fees, fines, costs, expenses, penalties, interest and city administrative fees, including also any
administrative fees charged by the Broward County Property Appraiser or Broward County Tax Collector for
placement on the annual tax bill, may be assessed against the property on the next available annual tax bill. This
assessment shall constitute a lien upon the tax parcels so assessed equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all
state, county, district or municipal taxes and non-ad valorem assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law,
such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims until paid. The lien for local business tax

the city commission finds:
(1)
Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse
secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution,
potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative
impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption
impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects.
(2)
Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government
interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which
is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented
and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses
extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may
locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed
to be relevant to said secondary effects.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such
secondary effects.

under the provisions of a court order at the particular location for which the license is sought.
(6)
Any sexually oriented business in which an applicant has had an influential interest, has, in the previous five (5)

work in a licensed sexually oriented business and the completed application, on its face, indicates that the
applicant is entitled to an annual sexually oriented business employee license. The temporary license shall expire
upon the final decision of the city to deny or grant an annual license. Within thirty (30) days of the filing of a
completed sexually oriented business employee license application, the city planner shall either issue a license to
the applicant or issue a written notice of intent to deny a license to the applicant. The city planner shall issue a
license unless:

number of the license issued to the licensee(s), the expiration date, and, if the license is for a sexually oriented
business, the address of the sexually oriented business. The sexually oriented business license shall be posted in
a conspicuous place at or near the entrance to the sexually oriented business so that it may be read at any time
that the business is occupied by patrons or is open to the public. A sexually oriented business employee shall
keep the employee's license on his or her person or on the premises where the licensee is then working.

the city commission finds:
(1)
Nudity, partial nudity, conduct by bikini-clad persons, and/or sexual conduct coupled with alcohol in public
places begets negative secondary effects, including sexual, lewd, lascivious, and salacious conduct among
patrons and employees resulting in violation of laws and in dangers to the health, safety and welfare of the
public;
(2)
Physical contact between employees of alcoholic beverage establishments, including "bed" dances, "couch"
dances, and "lap" dances as they are commonly called, are associated with and can lead to illicit sexual
activities, including masturbation, lewdness, and prostitution, as well as other negative effects, including sexual
assault;
(3)
The city finds that the foregoing conduct, even when said employees are technically not nude or semi-nude as
defined in other portions of Lauderhill regulations, is substantially similar to and presents similar concerns as
conduct by nude and semi-nude performers in sexually oriented businesses;
(4)
Each of the negative effects targeted by this section constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial
government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing such
negative effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis
between the regulated establishments and other, non-regulated establishments. The city finds that the cases and
secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to the city's
interest in preventing illicit sexual behavior.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to adverse
secondary effects, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.
(c)
On-premises conduct. No operator of a commercial establishment where alcohol is consumed shall knowingly
violate the following regulations or knowingly or recklessly allow an employee or any other person to violate the
following regulations:

employee, whether directly or through clothing or other covering, on the premises of the commercial
establishment.
(4)
No employee shall expose his or her genitals, pubic hair, buttocks, natal cleft, perineum, anus, vulva, or the
female breast below a horizontal line across the top of the areola and extending across the width of the breast at
that point (except that the exposure of the cleavage of the female breasts exhibited by a bikini, dress, blouse,
shirt, leotard, or similar wearing apparel is not prohibited) to a patron on the premises of the commercial
establishment. This subsection (4) does not apply to conduct in theaters, concert halls, art centers, museums, or
similar establishments that are primarily devoted to the arts or theatrical performances. The exception in the
previous sentence shall not be construed to apply to any sexually oriented business as defined in the Lauderhill
Code of Ordinances.

controls the business or a portion thereof. A person may be found to be an operator regardless of whether such
person is an owner, part owner, or licensee of the business.
(e)
Any person who shall violate any section hereof shall be subject to a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00), or imprisonment not to exceed sixty (60) days, or both, for each violation hereof. Each and every act,

of use of the establishment for a period of thirty (30) days.

of use of the establishment for a period of one (1) year.

Severability. Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is hereby declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any provision of this section, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is
held to be invalid, then the remaining provisions and the application of such provisions to any person or

(b)
Prohibition of right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers .
Findings; purpose; intent .
(1)
The city commission desires to adopt an ordinance restricting right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers to
certain streets and roadways located in the city because such solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers pose a danger to
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
499/653
themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic which
constitutes a traffic or pedestrian impediment or hazard or access obstruction;
(2)
According to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles 2007 Florida Traffic Crash
Statistics Report, five hundred fifty (550) pedestrians were killed on Florida roadways in 2007; sixty-five (65) of
those pedestrians were killed on roadways in Broward County; and
(3)
Based upon statistics collected by the Surface Transportation Policy Project, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area is
one of the most dangerous areas in the United States for pedestrians; and
(4)
The city has experienced pedestrian crashes resulting from solicitation in the roadways;
(5)
Numerous types of right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers and may seek to operate within the city,
including, but not limited to, children, adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and
community activities; vendors who sell flowers, newspapers and other products; and people who seek donations
or distribute written information; and
(6)
Right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged
in travel on roads, and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury, or death due to the speed and
number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city; and
(7)
Roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate right-of-way
solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers; and
(8)
According to a local newspaper article published in 2005, 29 right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and/or canvassers
have been seriously injured and at least 14 more have been killed by motor vehicles during a 15-year period;
many of those deaths occurred while the solicitor, peddler, and/or canvasser was sitting or standing in a median
or on the side of the street (including a Sun-Sentinel newspaper vendor who was struck by a car while carrying
papers on U.S. 1 and Broward Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale on July 50, 2000; a Miami Herald newspaper
vendor who was standing on the median at Federal Highway and Stirling Road on May 25, 2002; and a Miami
Herald newspaper vendor who was selling papers on the side of the street at Stirling Road and U.S. 441 on
August 7, 2002); and
(9)
The presence of right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers and interferes with the safe movement of
normal vehicular traffic and causes an unnecessary traffic safety hazard; and
(10)
The road network in the city is substantially burdened by a high volume of traffic, and road design frequently
includes complex vehicle turn movements that demand a driver's strict attention; and
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
500/653
(11)
It is the intention of the city commission to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant
governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and, consequently, the city staff analyzed each of the
major roads within the city and determined that the roads listed in subsection (c) below present an increased and
significant danger for use by distracted drivers, pedestrians and right-of-way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers
and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by right-of-way
solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers, and therefore the city commission has determined that such activities and
use by right-of way solicitors, peddlers, and canvassers shall be prohibited on the roadways listed in subsection
(c) below; and
(12)
It is the finding of the city commission that many other alternative channels of communication (other than rightof-
way solicitation, peddling, and canvassing on the prohibited roadways) exist for persons who seek to exercise
their First Amendment freedoms, such as, but by no means limited to, solicitation of funds or distribution of
literature through the mail or at alternate locations (such as houses of worship, shopping areas and special
events); the sale and/or distribution of newspapers through home or office delivery, vending machines and retail
stores; and the sale of goods and services at retail stores, through the internet and from vending machines; and
(15)
The city commission desires to preserve and protect the personal safety and quality of life of its residents and of
those who use streets within the city, both pedestrians and motorists alike; and
(14)
The city commission has reviewed the proposed regulations provided by this section and finds that such
regulations accomplish the purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive means to further and protect the
health and safety of its residents and those who use the city's designated roadways; and
(15)
The city commission finds that it is in the best interests of the residents of the city to adopt this section.
(c)

(b)
[Rules and regulations.] The city recreational department shall, from time to time, create rules and regulations
for the use of city athletic fields and municipal facilities. These rules and regulations shall be created and
amended from time to time by the city recreation department and may be enforced by that department to the
exclusion or expulsion of violators or by the withdrawal of permits solely at the discretion of the recreation
department. In the event that a permit shall be withdrawn, any fees previously paid to the city shall not be
refunded in whole or in part.
(c)
Use by commercial and/or for-profit users.
(1)
Intent and purpose. The city commission wishes to continue its efforts to protect and preserve its parks and
recreation facilities as areas devoted to rest, relaxation, recreational sports, family outings, special events and
other activities which serve to enhance the enjoyment of life, for the use of its present and future citizens. The
city commission is aware, however, that the personal liberties guaranteed under the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution allow persons the right to express their fundamental freedoms of speech, assembly
and religion in public areas such as the city parks, since parks have been consistently regarded and treated by the
courts as traditional public forums for such expressions.
It is, therefore, the purpose and intent of the city commission to try to strike a reasonable balance and achieve a
reconciliation of such uses, which occasionally compete with each other, by the enactment of regulations which
are content neutral as to the subject matter of expressions of opinions or of the viewpoints of a person or a
group. Furthermore, the city commission wishes to ensure that such regulations are tailored to avoid undue
restrictions upon or intrusions into personal freedoms of expression and to further ensure that reasonable
alternative modes of communications are available.
In addition, the city commission is aware that use of the parks and recreation facilities by commercial and forprofit
users may result in damage to the parks and recreation facilities greater than that customarily associated
with park usage. The city commission wishes to protect the condition of its parks and recreation facilities so that
the city's residents are not unfairly and unduly burdened with bearing the costs to repair said damages.

514/653
(2)
[Reservation required, when.] Any person, organization, entity or group of persons who wishes to temporarily
and exclusively use any city park area, recreation facility, or both, to sponsor, conduct or stage any function,
activity or event to be conducted or held with the recreation area, facility or both, must obtain a reservation in
advance of the event from the city parks and recreation department on a form promulgated by that department
for such purpose.
a.
Reservation procedure. Upon application, a reservation for any such use shall be issued to the applicant in
writing, specifying:
1.
The date and time it was issued;
2.
The name, address and telephone number of the applicant or designated agent;
3.
The name or other identification of the proposed event or use, including a brief description of it;
4.
The requested hours and days of use; and
5.
The boundaries, location or identity of the recreation area, facility, or all of the foregoing sought to be used.
(3)
All such applications shall be processed free of charge on an annual "first-come, first-served" basis,
commencing at the beginning of each calendar year. However, the actual reservation of the recreation services,
recreation areas, recreation facilities, park area or any of the foregoing shall be subject to payment to the city of
the user fees as established by the city.
(4)
Each reservation shall be issued promptly by the department as soon as a determination has been made that:
a.
There will be no overlapping, conflicting or concurrent use of an area, facility or both;
b.
The area, facility or both are otherwise reasonably available for use (for example, some areas cannot be
continuously used without damage; instead, the area must "rest and recover" from use to regenerate grass, and be
maintained so as to keep in good condition);
c.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
515/653
City equipment or personnel which must reasonably be available to service the reservation are so available (e.g.,
stages or special duty police or recreation personnel); and
d.
All other requirements of this section are satisfied or the city has received reasonable assurances that same will
be satisfied.
(5)
If the proposed function, activity, or event is, or may be, in the reasonable estimation of both the police chief and
the parks and recreation director, likely to be attended by a large number of patrons, attendees or invitees, they
shall, after consultation with the fire department and the applicant, outline reasonable conditions governing
vehicular parking locations and traffic control, points of access for pedestrians, movement of pedestrian traffic
within the park area, the facility or both, and provisions to ensure that the grounds are within the park area, the
facility or both, and provisions to ensure that the grounds are protected from undue wear and tear, damage or
destruction. For all purposes of this section, the term "director" shall include the director of the parks and leisure
services department or any authorized designee of the director. Further, the director shall ensure that suitable
arrangements are made in consultation with the applicant for sanitation and hygiene, such that a reasonable
number of restroom facilities are accessible (or, if necessary, additional temporary facilities are procured by the
applicant), and that trash collection and disposal arrangements are sufficient to accommodate the event. The
"reasonable estimation" by the director and police chief of the anticipated number of patrons shall be based upon
consideration of the following factors:
a.
Prior experiences with activities conducted by the particular applicant for the function, activity or event
requested, or prior experience with similar functions, events or comparable activities;
b.
The size of the entire park, including pedestrian and vehicular access in relation to the area facility or both
sought to be used; and
c.
The anticipated size or intensity and characteristics of the proposed use.
(6)
If the application involves allocation of limited space for exhibitors, concessionaires and other event
participants, and there are corresponding limitations on the areas remaining for pedestrian traffic, then any and
all persons who wish to exhibit, sell or distribute any items of any kind may be required by the sponsor of the
event to do so within the confines of designated booths or areas, to ensure orderly movement and maintenance of
crowd control.
(7)
Deposits; insurance.
a.
The director shall require the posting of a damage deposit in the minimum amount of five hundred dollars
($500.00). If the expected number of patrons, attendees or invitees is reasonably expected to exceed five
hundred (500) persons, then the amount of such deposit shall be increased by one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
each additional five hundred (500) persons anticipated to attend. Such deposit may be used by the city to defray
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
516/653
the costs to repair any damages to park and/or recreation facilities that arise as a result of the function, activity or
event. Any balance remaining, or the entire deposit, if applicable, shall be returned to the applicant within fifteen
(15) days after the function, activity or event has concluded. Any person who is dissatisfied with the
determination of the city to retain all or a portion of the deposit may appeal such determination to the city
commission for a hearing. Such appeal must be made with fifteen (15) days from the date the applicant is
notified of the determination of the city.
b.
If an event is authorized to provide for sales of beer, wine or both, as otherwise provided in this section, the
applicable deposit shall be doubled.
c.
Each applicant shall provide the city a certificate of insurance with such limits, coverages and underwriters as
the city risk insurance supervisor may require, given the size, nature, and scope of the activity contemplated by
the reservation. The city shall be named as an "additional insured" under the policy of insurance and a copy of
said insurance page shall be provided to the city prior to the date of the event.
(8)
On those occasions in which a park reservation is sought, an applicant whose purpose is primarily devoted to
civic, charitable, religious, or fraternal purposes may be authorized by the department to provide for the sale and
consumption of beer, wine, or both during the function, activity or event, provided, however, that if the city
police department determines, at any time while the event is underway, that such activities should be terminated,
such determination shall be immediately communicated to and observed by the applicant. Any applicant
obtaining such authorization shall be solely responsible for securing all applicable state licenses relating to such
sales and consumption.
(9)
It shall be unlawful and a violation of this section for any person to exhibit, sell or offer for sale any item or
thing, to distribute literature of any kind, or to convey any message, opinion or the like within the park area,
facility or both which is the subject of a reservation unless such person has obtained authorization of the holder
of the reservation.

Sec. 18-31. - Findings and conclusions.
The city commission finds and concludes that:
(1)
The streets and sidewalks have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public.
(2)
Consistent with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 4 of the Florida
Constitution, the city has the authority to regulate newsracks to further its significant interests in public safety
and aesthetics provided that such regulations are valid time, place or manner restrictions.
(3)
The United States Supreme Court has recognized aesthetics and safety as significant government interests
legitimately furthered through ordinances regulating First Amendment expression in various contexts.
(4)
The public and the private sector have invested and will continue to invest significant monies in maintaining and
improving the public right-of-way so as to enhance pedestrian and vehicular safety and circulation, and to
enhance its aesthetic appearance.
(5)
The uncontrolled placement, installation, operation and maintenance of newsracks within the public right-ofway
presents an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using such rights-of-way,
including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, drivers and persons performing
essential utility, traffic control and emergency services;
(6)
The uncontrolled placement, installation, operation, maintenance and appearance of newsracks within the public
right-of-way degrades the quality of life by militating against the city's substantial efforts to beautify its public
rights-of-way and to beautify and promote its "tropical" image through design guidelines for nonresidential
structures.
(7)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
525/653
Newsracks located in a manner to cause an inconvenience and danger to persons using such rights-of-way or to
undermine the facilitation of pedestrian and vehicular circulation and aesthetic improvements constitute a public
nuisance.
(8)
The regulation of placement, installation, operation, maintenance and appearance of newsracks within the public
right-of-way will:
a.
Provide access for the use and maintenance of poles, posts, traffic signals, hydrants, mailboxes, sidewalks,
pedestrian walkways and transportation facilities;
b.
Eliminate sight line obstructions;
c.
Reduce unnecessary exposure of the public to personal injury or property damage;
d.
Improve the aesthetic appearance and enhance the community appearance through uniformity and consistency
with architectural design guidelines;

Consistent with community standards regarding adult entertainment, treat all publications equally regardless of
their size, content, circulation or frequency of publication.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL
Sec. 19-1. - Investment policy.
(a)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
534/653
Objective. To document the investment policy for the city operating funds, reserve funds, and restricted funds.
(b)
Scope. The purpose of this investment policy is to establish objectives and standards of care and to define
suitable/authorized investment instruments and investment guidelines for each investment program. This policy
pertains to funds in excess of those required to meet short-term expenses. It does not pertain to pension funds,
trust funds or bond funds where there are other existing policies or indentures in effect.
(c)
Authority. Finance director and F.S. § 218.415. To enhance the effectiveness of the city staff in managing these
funds, outside investment managers may be hired.
(d)
Investment objectives.
(1)
Preservation of principal and safety. The foremost objective of this investment program is the preservation of the
principal. The objective will be to manage credit risk and interest rate risk for each specific investment program.
(2)
Liquidity. The portfolio shall be managed in such a manner that funds are available to meet reasonably
anticipated cash flow requirements in an orderly manner. The portfolio has been broken down into three (3)
separate investment programs based on anticipated liquidity needs and each program will have specific
guidelines to meet that program's liquidity needs.
(3)
Return on investment/yield. All investments will be made striving to maximize portfolio return, consistent with
the stated quality, safety and liquidity restrictions of each program. Yield shall be the primary source of
investment returns. Investment returns shall be secondary to the requirements for quality, safety and liquidity.
(e)
Authorized investments.
(1)
The Local Government Surplus Funds Trust Fund, as created by F.S. § 218.405 or any intergovernmental
investment pool authorized pursuant to the Florida Interlocal Cooperation Act of 1969, as provided in F.S. §
163.01;

280.02;
(5)

(4,000,000) total at any time.
(7)
Prime commercial paper of a United States corporation, finance company or banking institution if such

Investment grade obligations of state and local governments and public authorities.
(f)
Specific program investment objectives and guidelines.
(1)
Operating account. The main objectives for the operating account are safety of principal and adequate liquidity.
These funds are designated for immediate city expenses. Therefore, the investments in the operating account will
be limited to demand deposits, money market funds and other short-term securities of the adequate liquidity. Up
to fifty (50) percent of the operating account may be invested in corporate bonds with a minimum rating of
investment grade by a national rating service (NRS). In addition, corporate holdings will be well diversified with
a target position of two (2) percent or less in any corporate issuer.
(2)
Reserves account. The main objectives for the reserves account are safety of principal and liquidity. These funds
are designated for emergency purposes, such as natural disasters. The liquidity needs of the reserves account are
more unpredictable and, as such, investments will be limited to securities with maturities not to exceed
(maximum maturity). Up to fifty (50) percent of the reserves account may be invested in corporate bonds with a
minimum rating of investment grade by a national rating service (NRS). In addition, corporate holdings will be
well diversified with a target position of two (2) percent or less invested in any one corporate issuer.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
536/653
(3)
Restricted account. The main objectives of the restricted account are safety of principal and higher yields
typically available in intermediate to longer-term securities. These funds are designated for known longer-term
obligations related to debt payments of the city. The liquidity needs of the restricted account are more clearly
defined and allow for the portfolio to take advantage of higher yields by being able to closely match projected
cash flow needs to the maturity structure of the portfolio. Up to fifty (50) percent of the restricted account may
be invested in corporate bonds with a minimum rating of investment grade by a national rating service (NRS). In
addition, corporate holdings will be well diversified with a target position of two (2) percent or less invested in
any one corporate issuer.
(g)
Risk and diversification. Adequate diversification of the portfolio will be necessary to minimize market
volatility risk, liquidity risk and default risk. Diversification will come in the form of investing in different
security types, and in different financial institutions. It is the policy of the city to diversify its investment
portfolios so as to protect against issuer defaults, market price changes, technical complications leading to
temporary lack of liquidity, or other risks resulting from an over concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issuer, a specific geographical distribution, or a specific class of securities. Up to one hundred (100)
percent may be invested in the authorized investment in subsection (e) except for the corporate bond portion,
which is limited to fifty (50) percent. The fifty (50) percent corporate allocation is intended to limit new
commitments and is not intended to force the sale of existing holdings. No new commitments to corporate bonds
shall be made when this will cause the value of the corporate bonds plus the value of future obligations to
exceed fifty (50) percent of the current value of the total portfolio. The following strategies will be reviewed
periodically by the city or any committee so established by the city.
(h)
Prudence.
(1)
Prudence standard applied to the portfolio. The standard of prudence shall be applied in the context of managing
the portfolio. Those individuals acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided
deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse
developments.
(2)
Prudent expert standard. While the standard of prudence to be used by individuals who are officers or employees
is the prudent person standard, any person or firm hired or retained to invest, monitor, or advise concerning these
assets shall be held to the higher standard of prudent expert. The standard shall be that in investing and
reinvesting monies and in acquiring, retaining, managing, and disposing of investments of these funds, the
individuals shall exercise the judgment, care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then
prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence, acting in a like capacity and familiar with
such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims by diversifying the
investments of the funds so as to minimize the risk of material losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly
prudent not to do so, and not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of similar funds,
considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital.
(i)
Ethics. The prudent person rule is in effect, which states as follows, "Investments should be made with judgment
and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
537/653
in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation. But for investment, considering the probable safety
of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived from the investment."
(j)
Performance benchmarks. Investment performance benchmarks should be consistent with the quality, safety and
liquidity restrictions utilized to evaluate portfolio performance. These benchmarks will allow the city to compare
to other investors in similar markets.
Based on the investment and maturity parameters for each investment program, the city shall establish specific
performance benchmarks. These benchmarks are as follows:
Operating account: Merrill Lynch 0-1 year Treasury Notes and Bonds (GOQA)
Reserves account: Merrill Lynch US 1 Year Treasury Note Index (GC03)
Restricted account: Merrill Lynch US 1 to 10 Year Treasury Index (G502)
(k)
Authorized institutions.
Brokers/dealers. The city may utilize dealers designated as "Primary Securities Dealers" by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, for direct purchases and sales of securities. The city may also utilize non-primary securities
(regional) dealers doing business in the state. Both the firm and the dealer for non-primary dealers must have
been engaged in the business of effecting transactions in U.S. government and agency obligations for at least
five (5) consecutive years. The firm must have capital of no less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000.00). Both
primary and non-primary dealers must qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1
(uniform net capital rule).
(l)
Security selection process. After the finance director or the city's financial advisor has determined the
approximate maturity date based on cash flow needs and market conditions and has analyzed and selected one
(1) or more optimal types of investments, a minimum of three (3) qualified banks and/or approved
broker/dealers must be contacted and asked to provide bids/offers on investments in question. Bids will be held
in confidence until the bid deemed to best meet the investment objectives is determined and selected.
However, if obtaining bids/offers are not feasible and appropriate, investments may be purchased utilizing the
comparison to current market price method on an exception basis. Acceptable current market price providers
include, but are not limited to:
(1)
Telerate information system.
(2)
Bloomberg information system.
(3)
Wall Street Journal or a comparable nationally recognized financial publications providing daily market pricing.
(4)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
538/653
Daily market pricing provided by the city's custodian or their correspondent institutions.
Examples of when this method may be used include:
a.
When time constraints due to unusual circumstances preclude the use of the competitive bidding process.
b.
When no active market exists for the issue being traded due to the age or depth of the issue.
c.
When a security is unique to a single dealer, for example, private placement.
d.
When the transaction involves a new issues or issues in the "when issued" market.
Overnight sweep investments will not be bid, but may be placed with the city's depository bank relating to the
demand account for which the repurchase agreement was purchased.
(m)
Investment transaction authority. The city manager has designated the finance director as the individual
responsible for managing the city's investments. For internally managed assets, the finance director discusses
investments with upcoming maturities with the city's financial advisor if there is a question as to new maturity
target dates, portfolio reallocation, or type of investment vehicle to be used. Based on these discussions, the
finance director completes an "investment transaction authorization" for each investment transaction. The city
manager then reviews and approves the investment transaction authorization. The fully executed investment
transaction authorization contains all information pertinent to the investment and contains the approval
signatures of the finance director. The authorized investment transaction is executed.
Funds related to each investment are transferred according to authorized funds transfer procedures and limits
established under the provisions of the city's agreement with its main depository bank.
(n)
External investment manager.
(1)
Purpose. The purpose of this section is to set forth the policy and objectives governing the city's use of external
investment managers. The outside investment manager for the city is required to adhere to all of the principals as
set forth by the city investment policy concerning purpose, scope, objectives, prudence, internal controls,
safekeeping and custody, debt service and bond covenants requirements, diversification, liquidity, credit risk,
market risk and reporting requirements. Outside investment managers will be required to seek best execution on
all trades.
(2)
Monitoring and adjusting the portfolio. The external investment manager will monitor the contents of the
portfolio, the available markets and the relative values of competing securities and will adjust the portfolio
accordingly.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
539/653
(o)
Safekeeping and collateralization. All cash, assets, and investment securities purchased by the city or held as
collateral on investments shall be delivered versus the payment of funds and held in safekeeping by a qualified
bank, or some other financial institution designated as custodian. The custodian will be selected by the city. The
custodian will not be utilized to buy or sell investments for the city. All securities held as collateral will be held
free and clear of any lien, and also shall be held by a third-party custodian. The investments held by the
custodian must be reconciled monthly to the city's general ledger.
All securities purchased by the city will be held by a third-party custodian and no withdrawal of such securities
may be made by anyone except the city manager or the finance director.
The city manager or finance director will execute all third party custodial agreements with the city's banks and
public depositories. Such an agreement will include letters of authority from the city manager or finance director
as to the responsibilities of each party, notification of security purchases, sale, delivery, safekeeping and
transaction agreements and wire transfers, safekeeping and transaction costs, and procedures in the event of wire
failure.
Any funds invested in a certificate of deposit from a qualified public depository may be collateralized by any of
the securities listed in F.S. §§ 280.13 and 280.14. The list of qualified depositories, agreeing to the provisions in
F.S. ch. 136, is available upon request from the state department of insurance and treasurer.
This section does not apply to the Local Government Surplus Funds Trust Fund.
(p)
Internal controls. Funds may be transferred via telephone request from authorized city personnel. A letter of
authorization signed by the finance director and city manager (or their authorized representative) which allows
fund transfers between city accounts at specified institutions shall be on file at each institution where securities
are kept. The Federal Reserve Bank shall have the authorization signed by the finance director to directly wire
funds into the primary operation account of the city. Purchases and sales made at primary dealers shall be made
via telephone instructions from an authorized finance department representative and be confirmed in writing by
the finance director and city manager (or their authorized representative).
(q)
State investments. The financial director and city manager, in making any investment of surplus funds, shall
initially seek out investments through financial institutions domiciled in the state and shall make investments
through such institutions unless a better return on investment with similar or better security of investment in
offered by an out-of-state institution.
(r)
Reports. An annual report which lists securities by class/type, book value, market value and income earned will
be available for review in the finance department. A portfolio summary which lists all securities held will be
produced monthly.
(s)

Sec. 19-66. - Objections to improvements.
At the meeting for hearing objections, or at a time and place to which the same may be adjourned, any person
aggrieved may appear in person, by attorney, or by petition, and may object to or protest against said
improvement. The city council shall consider the objections and protests, if any, and may confirm, amend,
modify or rescind the resolution of necessity, and shall determine whether the same improvement shall be made,
and how the cost thereof shall be paid. The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive. If the
council determines to proceed with such improvement as originally proposed or in an amended or modified
form, it shall adopt a resolution determining to proceed, as hereinafter set out.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 6, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-67. - Claims arising out of improvements.
The owner of any lot or land bounding and abutting upon a proposed special improvement, who claims that he
will sustain damage by reason of the improvement, shall present such claim to the city council at the time of its
meeting on the question of whether it should proceed with the improvement as provided in the preceding
section. Such claim shall be in writing, and shall set forth the amount of damages claimed, with a general
description of the property with respect to which it is claimed the damage will accrue. Any owner who fails to
do so shall be deemed to have waived such damage, and shall be barred, thereafter, from filing a claim or
receiving damages therefor. This provision shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the
improvement, but shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages arising without his fault from
negligent acts of the city or its agents.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 7, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-68. - Resolution determining to proceed.
If, after hearing the objections and protest, if any, the city council determines that it is necessary and/or wise and
expedient to proceed with such improvement in the original or modified form, said council shall adopt a
resolution determining to proceed with such improvement, which resolution shall disclose what part of the total
cost and expenses of the improvement shall be chargeable against and assessed against the property benefited by
the improvement, and what part or proportion of the total costs shall be paid by the City of Lauderhill from its
general fund or any special fund on hand for such purpose. The resolution may direct that the whole or any part
of the cost and expenses thereof be assessed against the property abutting upon the improvement; or may
provide that all property benefited by the improvement may be assessed for such improvement in the manner set
out therein.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 8, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-69. - Assessment roll and notice.
Upon the completion of any improvement hereunder, the city council shall cause to be prepared a roll or list to
be called the "assessment list," showing the improvement number, the number of the assessment lien, a
description of each lot or parcel of land proposed to be assessed, and the amount to be assessed against each lot
or parcel of land, and the name of each owner as shown on the city tax roll or records. Such lists shall be a
public record constituting notice to the public of the lien against the land so assessed and no other record or
notice thereof shall be necessary to any person or corporation for that purpose. No errors, omissions, or mistakes
in regard to description of property shall be held to invalidate any assessment appearing upon such assessment
list, where the description given is sufficient to identify the property. After the completion of said assessment
list, same shall be delivered to the city clerk of the City of Lauderhill, who shall thereupon give notice by
publication once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a published newspaper circulated within said
municipality, that the assessment list has been delivered to the city clerk of the City of Lauderhill, and that same
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
551/653
is open for inspection at the office of the city clerk and that at a time and place therein mentioned, not less than
fifteen (15) days from the first publication, the city council will meet to hear and determine any objections or
defenses that may be filed to such assessment or the amount thereof. Said notice shall state the number of the
improvement, the general character of the work which has been performed, the name by which such
improvement is generally known, and the location in which such improvement has been constructed. Instead of
publishing in the newspaper as aforesaid, the city council may authorize the notice to be sent by registered mail,
return receipt requested, to the property owners directly affected, if the council determines that it would be less
expensive and the property owner would be as well advised by mail as by publication.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 9, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-70. - Hearing; confirmation of assessment list.
At the time fixed in such notice of assessment, the city council shall hear objections to the amount of such
assessment which may be made by the owners of real property assessed for such improvement, or by parties
having an interest therein, and the city council shall determine and hear all objections and protests to the
proposed assessments under such rules and regulations as it may adopt. The council shall have a right to change
or adjust any assessment appearing upon such assessment list at such meeting; provided, however, that all
property owners affected are treated equally. When such assessment list has been finally corrected and adjusted,
the council shall adopt a resolution approving and confirming the assessment list and therein shall approve and
confirm all assessments as finally fixed and adjusted at such hearing, and such assessments shall, from date of
confirmation by such resolution, constitute a lien on the respective lots or parcels of land, or other real property
upon which they are levied, superior to all other liens, except those for city and county taxes. All persons who
fail to object to the proposed assessments, in the manner herein provided, shall be deemed to have consented to
and approved the same. All persons who appeared at such hearing and whose objections were overruled or
denied shall be deemed to be bound by the action of the city council after thirty (30) days from the adoption of
such resolution approving and confirming the assessment list, unless suit challenging such assessment be filed.
Substantial compliance with the procedure outlined shall be all that is necessary to render such assessment liens
valid and incontestable, it being the expressed intention of the legislature that the requirements are directory
rather than mandatory.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 10, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-71. - Assessments against United States or political subdivisions.
No special assessments shall be made under this article against the property of the United States, or against the
State of Florida, or any political subdivision or taxing district of the State of Florida owning real estate within
the city.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 11, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-72. - Setting aside special assessments.
If any special assessment made hereunder to defray the whole or part of the expense of any local improvement
shall be either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city
council shall be satisfied that any assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced and
collected, or if the said council shall have omitted to make such assessment when it might have done so, it is
hereby authorized to take all steps to cause a new assessment for the whole or any part of any improvement and
against any property benefited by any improvement, which procedures and steps shall follow the provisions of
this article as may be possible under the circumstances. In the event such second assessment shall be annulled,
vacated or set aside, then and in that event, the council may obtain and make another assessment until a valid
special assessment shall be accomplished. No omission, informality or irregularity in the proceedings
preliminary to the making of a conformed special assessment list by the council shall render said special
assessment invalid, and the conformed special assessment list and the record thereof kept by the city clerk shall
be competent and sufficient evidence that the special assessment list was duly made and adopted and that the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
552/653
special assessment was duly levied, and said conformed special assessment list shall also be competent and
sufficient evidence that all other proceedings necessary to the adoption of said special assessment list were duly
had, taken and performed as required by this article, and no variance from the directions herein contained as to
the form and manner of any of the proceedings shall be held material, unless it is clearly shown that the party
objecting to said special assessment process was materially injured thereby. In the event any special assessment
shall, in any suit where its validity shall be questioned, be adjudged invalid, the city council may, in its
discretion, notify the mayor to cease the collections, and the council may proceed anew by proceedings as if the
matter was taken under the provision for an original special assessment for the same purpose, or, in the
alternative, the council may cure any defects found by such judgment by taking up the previous proceedings at
any point, and may make and levy a new assessment in the place and stead of the assessment which shall have
been adjudged invalid, and the city clerk, before delivering such new assessment to the mayor for collection,
shall ascertain and note thereon any and all payments which had been made pursuant to such invalid assessment
for the same purpose, which notation shall cancel the assessments as to the parcels and lots on which such
payments were made to the extent of the payments so made. Such new special assessments shall be collected in
the same manner as an original special assessment.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 12, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-73. - Suits, actions, writs or special proceedings.
For the period of thirty (30) days after the date of the confirmation of any special assessment, any person
aggrieved shall have the right to contest the legality thereof by suit, action, writ or special proceedings, after
which time no suit, action, writ or special proceedings in any manner questioning the legality of the said special
assessment shall lie for any cause whatsoever.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 13, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-74. - Method of collection; delinquency penalties.
The resolution approving and confirming the assessment list shall provide whether such special assessments
shall be payable in cash within thirty (30) days from the adoption of such resolution, or whether such special
assessments shall be payable in annual installments not exceeding ten (10) annual installments, the first of which
shall be payable on or before the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of confirmation. If the council
desires that the assessment shall be payable in annual installments, said annual installments not to exceed ten
(10) in number, said council shall fix an interest rate, not to exceed the maximum interest rate allowed by the
applicable Florida Statutes, which interest shall accrue on said unpaid installments from the date of the
acceptance of said improvements by the council. In the event the payment of the special assessment shall be
made in annual installments, not to exceed ten (10) in number, and in the event any installments, including
interest thereon, shall not be paid when due, there shall be added a penalty at the rate of one (1) percent per
month, computed upon the entire principal balance of the assessment outstanding at the time said penalty
accrues, and said interest and penalty shall continue to accrue until said installment is paid. The owner of the
property desiring to pay his assessment in installments, if same shall be permitted, shall, on or before thirty (30)
days from the confirmation of such assessments, file with the city clerk a written application to pay said
assessments in installments, which application shall state that the applicant and property owner waives all
irregularities or defects, constitutional, jurisdictional or otherwise, in the proceedings for the improvement for
which the assessments are levied, and in the apportionment of the cost thereof; and thereafter the validity of such
assessments shall not be called in question. The payment of an assessment, in whole or in part, shall constitute a
waiver of all defects, constitutional, jurisdictional or otherwise, in the proceedings. Said application shall also
contain an agreement that the applicant and property owner will pay the said assessment in installments at the
date fixed by said resolution, with interest at the rates specified in said resolution. Said application shall also
make a reference to the number of improvements, and shall contain a description of the lots or parcel of property
of the applicant assessed for such improvements.

11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
553/653
Sec. 19-75. - Lien docket.
The city clerk shall keep all applications in convenient forms for examination, and such applications shall show
the date of filing, the name of the applicant, the amount of the assessment as shown in the application, and the
number of installments in which same shall be payable. Such approved assessment list and such applications
shall constitute a docket and shall stand as a lien docket for the assessment in favor of the City of Lauderhill
against such lot or parcel of land, until such assessment and interest and penalties are paid in the manner
hereinafter provided. Such approved assessment list or roll shall be the official record to evidence the lien, and
the form or manner of keeping and preserving same shall not be material so long as said list or roll contains the
necessary information and is prepared and approved in the manner herein specified. All unpaid assessments,
penalties and interest shall be and shall constitute a lien on each lot or parcel of land, respectively, in favor of the
municipality, and such liens shall have priority over all other liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except liens
for city and county taxes.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 15, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-76. - Special assessment revolving fund.
The city council shall have the right to create, by ordinance, any special assessment revolving fund or funds, out
of which may be paid the cost of any proposed improvement, where special assessments are levied or are to be
levied to pay all or a portion of the cost thereof, and there may be deposited in such special assessment revolving
fund or funds, all the proceeds from the collection of principal and interest of any such assessment revolving
fund or funds, and such special assessment revolving fund or funds shall constitute a permanent fund. The city
shall transfer to such fund or funds yearly from the general fund or other source of revenue an amount not less
than the city's portion of the cost of the improvements made from moneys in such fund. Such special assessment
revolving fund or funds shall constitute a permanent fund or funds to be used for the purpose of paying the cost
of local improvements, where the proceeds of the assessment liens levied in connection therewith are to be
deposited in the funds as collected. The moneys in such special assessment revolving fund or funds at the close
of the fiscal year shall not be transferred or appropriated to any other fund, but shall be used exclusively for the
purposes of making local improvements where special assessments are to be levied to repay all or a part of the
cost thereof.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 16, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-77. - Assessment liens not assignable.
Assessment liens for local improvements are not assignable or transferable, but when same become defaulted
they shall be foreclosed by the city.
(Ord. No. 82-132, § 17, 7-27-82)
Sec. 19-78. - Foreclosure by city.
Should any assessment lien remain in the hands of the City of Lauderhill and become in default, and remain in
default for a period of ninety (90) days after becoming due and payable, it shall be the duty of the city clerk to
forward to the city attorney for collection a certified list of such assessment liens. It shall be the duty of the city
attorney to institute foreclosure proceedings to foreclose said assessment liens against the property encumbered
thereby, and against which the lien exists, and the owner of the property against which the lien exists shall be
liable to the city for a reasonable attorney's fee with which to compensate its attorney for services in collecting
the amounts due on said lien. The final decree to be entered shall decree the amount of said lien and reasonable
attorney's fees and all costs occasioned or necessitated by such foreclosure, as a lien against the property
described. The lien for attorney's fees and costs shall arise whenever the lien is placed in the hands of the city
attorney for collection, and such lien for attorney's fees shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the amount due.

Sec. 19-103. - General findings.
It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that:
(A)
Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution, and F.S. § 166.021 and 166.041, the city commission
has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions and to render municipal services in a
manner not inconsistent with law, and such power may be exercised by the enactment of city ordinances.
(B)
The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose
except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may legislate on any subject matter on which
the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3),
Florida Statutes. The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of section 166.021(3), Florida Statutes,
are not relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire rescue services, facilities or programs of the city.
(C)
The purpose of this ordinance is to (1) provide procedures and standards for the imposition of city-wide fire
rescue assessments under the general home rule powers of a municipality to impose special assessments; (2)
authorize a procedure for the funding of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs providing special benefits to
property within the city; and (3) legislatively determine the special benefit provided to assessed property from
the provision of combined fire rescue services by the city under its consolidated fire rescue program.

uniform assessment collection act are ministerial.

Sec. 19-104. - Legislative determinations of special benefit.
It is hereby ascertained and declared that the fire rescue services, facilities, and programs provide a special
benefit to property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building based upon the following
legislative determinations:
(A)
Fire rescue services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of improved property by: (1)
protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the provision of available fire rescue services;
(2) protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of improvements and structures
within improved parcels; (3) lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and
comprehensive fire rescue program within the city; and (4) containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on
vacant property with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property.
(B)
The combined fire control and rescue services of the city under its existing consolidated fire rescue program
enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the use and enjoyment of buildings within
improved parcels of property within the areas served by the city.
(C)
The combined fire control and rescue services of the city under its existing consolidated fire rescue program
enhance the value of business and commercial property that is improved by the existence or construction of a
building which enhanced value can be anticipated to be reflected in the rental charge or value of such business or
commercial property.

assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Division 2.

fire rescue assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the special
benefit. All written objections to the final assessment resolution shall be filed with the city manager at or before
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances

Sec. 19-117. - Effect of final assessment resolution.
The fire rescue assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established upon adoption of the final assessment
resolution. The adoption of the final assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented
(including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed
property; the method of apportionment and assessment; the initial rate of assessment; the maximum assessment
rate, if any; the initial assessment roll; and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps
shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the
city commission action on the final assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final
assessment resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection

Sec. 19-118. - Adoption of annual rate resolution.
(A)
The city commission shall adopt an annual rate resolution during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year
following the initial fiscal year for which a fire rescue assessment is imposed hereunder.
(B)
The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate
resolution by the city commission (1) containing a brief and general description of the fire rescue services,
facilities, or programs to be provided; (2) determining the fire rescue assessed cost to be assessed for the
upcoming fiscal year; (3) establishing the estimated assessment rate for the upcoming fiscal year; (4)

circumstances described in subsection (F) of this section so require, and (c) directing and authorizing any
supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or convenient by the city.
(C)
The annual rate resolution shall (1) establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year
and (2) approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the city commission
deems just and right. The assessment roll shall be prepared in accordance with the method of apportionment set
forth in the initial assessment resolution, or any subsequent preliminary rate resolution, together with
modifications, if any, that are provided and confirmed in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent
annual rate resolution.
(D)
Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from providing annual notification to all owners of assessed
property in the manner provided in either or both section 19-114 or 19-115 hereof.
(E)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
561/653
The city commission may establish or increase a maximum assessment rate in an initial assessment resolution or
preliminary rate resolution and confirm such maximum assessment rate in the event notice of such maximum
rate assessment has been included in the notices required by section 19-114 and 19-115 hereof.
(F)
In the event (1) the proposed fire rescue assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the rates of assessment adopted
by the city commission including a maximum assessment rate, if any, that were listed in the notices previously
provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to section 19-114 and 19-115 hereof, (2) the purpose for
which the fire rescue assessment is imposed or the use of the revenue from the fire rescue assessment is
substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property
pursuant to section 19-114 and 19-115 hereof, (3) assessed property is reclassified or the method of
apportionment is revised or altered resulting in an increased fire rescue assessment from that represented by
notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 19-114 and 19-115 hereof, or
(4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the
prior fiscal year, notice shall be provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed
property as provided by law. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice requirements set forth in
section 19-114 and 19-115 hereof and inform the owner of the date, time, and place for the adoption of the
annual rate resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence, shall not
affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue
assessment imposed by the city commission pursuant to this ordinance.
(G)
As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll approved by the adoption of the final assessment
resolution or a prior year's annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution shall be
the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed property (including, but not limited to, the
determination of special benefit and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment
and assessment, the rate of assessment, the establishment or increase of a maximum assessment rate, the
assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the fire rescue assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a
court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from the date of the city commission
action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the
finality of any fire rescue assessment not challenged within the required twenty-day period for those fire rescue
assessments previously imposed against assessed property by the inclusion of the assessed property on an
assessment roll approved in the final assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution.
(H)
The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required
by the uniform assessment collection act, or if the alternative method described in section 19-152 hereof is used
to collect the fire rescue assessments, such other official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. If
the fire rescue assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced, or abated by the court, an adjustment
shall be made on the assessment roll.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 2.08, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-119. - Lien of fire rescue assessments.
Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all fire rescue assessments shall constitute a lien against assessed
property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special
assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens,
mortgages, titles, and claims, until paid. The lien for a fire rescue assessment shall be deemed perfected upon
adoption by the city commission of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is
applicable. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection act shall
attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
562/653
imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a fire rescue assessment collected under the alternative method of
collection provided in section 19-152 shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city commission of the
final assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable, and shall attach to the property
on such date of adoption.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 2.09, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-120. - Revisions to fire rescue assessments.
If any fire rescue assessment made under the provisions of this ordinance is either in whole or in part annulled,
vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such fire rescue
assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city commission
has failed to include or omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so
included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new fire rescue assessment against any
property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of
this ordinance and in case such second fire rescue assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city
commission may obtain and impose other fire rescue assessments until a valid fire rescue assessment is imposed.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 2.10, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-121. - Procedural irregularities.
Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any fire rescue assessment
under the provisions of this ordinance shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any
fire rescue assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such fire rescue
assessment was duly levied, that the fire rescue assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other
proceedings adequate to such fire rescue assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this
ordinance; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that
the party objecting was materially injured thereby.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 2.11, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-122. - Correction of errors and omissions.
(A)
No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city commission, or
their deputies, employees or designees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire
rescue assessment imposed by the city commission under the provisions of this ordinance.
(B)
When it shall appear that any fire rescue assessment should have been imposed under this ordinance against a
parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that
such property was omitted from the assessment roll; or such property was erroneously assessed; or was not listed
on the tax roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the
annual rate resolution for any upcoming fiscal year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail
provided to the owner of the omitted or erroneously assessed parcel in the manner and form provided in section
19-115, impose the applicable fire rescue assessment for the fiscal year in which such error or omission is
discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue assessment due for the prior two (2) fiscal years. Such fire
rescue assessment shall constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all
state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other
prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as
provided in article III hereof, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing
the omitted, delinquent, or corrected assessments.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
563/653
(C)
Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, the city manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in
response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to a fire rescue assessment, to
reclassify property based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in
applying the fire rescue assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise
requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall
be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the fire rescue assessment imposed
under the provisions of this ordinance. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes,
modifications or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the city manager and not the property
appraiser or tax collector.
(D)
After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the
procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and
direction of the city manager.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 2.12, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-123. - Interim assessments.
(A)
The city commission is hereby authorized to impose an interim fire rescue assessment against all property for
which a certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) is issued after the
adoption of the annual rate resolution. The amount of the interim fire rescue assessment shall be calculated upon
a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance
with the annual rate resolution for the fiscal year for which the interim fire rescue assessment is being imposed.
Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the
monthly rate, the interim fire rescue assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's fire
rescue assessment. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city
commission) without the payment in full of the interim fire rescue assessment shall not relieve the owner of such
property of the obligation of full payment. Any interim fire rescue assessment not collected prior to the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission) may be collected
pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as provided in section 19-151 of this ordinance, under the
alternative collection method provided in section 19-152 or by any other method authorized by law. Any interim
fire rescue assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate of occupancy (or building
permit, as determined by the city commission) was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of
that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes
and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in
and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy (or building permit, as determined by the city commission.
(B)
In the event the city commission chooses to collect the interim fire rescue assessment at the time a building
permit is issued, the following procedure shall apply:
(1)
In the event a building permit expires prior to completion of the building for which it was issued, and the
applicant paid the interim fire rescue assessment at the time the building permit was issued, the applicant may
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
564/653
within ninety (90) days of the expiration of the building permit apply for a refund of the interim fire rescue
assessment. Failure to timely apply for a refund of the fire rescue assessment shall waive any right to a refund.
(2)
The application for refund shall be filed with the city's building department and shall contain the following:
(a)
The name and address of the applicant;
(b)
The location of the property and the tax parcel identification number for the property which was the subject of
the building permit;
(c)
The date the fire rescue assessment was paid;
(d)
A copy of the receipt of payment for the fire rescue assessment; and
(e)
The date the building permit was issued and the date of expiration.
(3)
After verifying that the building permit has expired and that the building has not been completed, the city's
building department shall refund the interim fire rescue assessment paid for such building.
(4)
In the event a new building permit is subsequently issued for a building on the same property which was the
subject of a refund, the interim fire rescue assessment shall be paid as required by this section 19-123.

DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION AND USE OF FIRE RESCUE ASSESSMENTS
Sec. 19-151. - Method of collection.
(A)
Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the fire rescue assessments shall be collected pursuant to the
uniform method provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all
applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing or notice required by this
ordinance may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection
Act or other provision of law.
(B)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
565/653
The amount of a fire rescue assessment to be collected using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to
the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable
service, facility, or program provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with the prior year's
assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner as required under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act,
and (3) any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such fire
rescue assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 3.01, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-152. - Alternative method of collection.
In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city commission may elect to collect the fire
rescue assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method
provided by this section:
(A)
The city commission shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected
parcel of property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include
(1) a brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to
determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment, (3) the number of units contained within the parcel, (4) the
total amount of the fire rescue assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period, (5) the location
at which payment will be accepted, (6) the date on which the fire rescue assessment is due, and (7) a statement
that the fire rescue assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the
liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments.
(B)
A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire rescue assessments shall be recorded in the
official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be
filed in the official records.
(C)
The city commission shall have the right to foreclose and collect all delinquent fire rescue assessments in the
manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to
institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is
not paid within thirty (30) days from the date payment is due. The city commission or its agent shall notify any
property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the
date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city commission or its agent will either
(1) initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a
delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on
real property, or (2) cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue assessment, not previously subject
to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax
bill for a subsequent year.
(D)
All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any
foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale
pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city
commission or its agent may join in one (1) foreclosure action the collection of fire rescue assessments against
any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
566/653
foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city
commission and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue
assessments and any other costs incurred by the city commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue
assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action.
(E)
In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto,
may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (1) notice is
provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this ordinance, and
(2) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by
the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector.
(F)
Notwithstanding the city commission's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have
the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or other city officials in section
19-122 hereof.
(G)
Any city commission action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by resolution.
(Ord. No. 00O-6-39, § 3.02, 7-10-00; Ord. No. 01O-9-52, § 1, 9-24-01)
Sec. 19-153. - Government property.
(A)
In the event fire rescue assessments are imposed against government property, the city commission shall provide
fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of government property. The
bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment, (2)
a description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment, (3) the
number of units contained within the parcel, (4) the total amount of the parcel's fire rescue assessment for the
appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, and (6) the date on which the fire rescue
assessment is due.
(B)
Fire rescue assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other fire
rescue assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment.
(C)
A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date any
installment is due. The city commission shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in
payment of its fire rescue assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice
shall state that the city commission will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel
payment.
(D)
All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any
mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All
delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall
be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
567/653
attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city
commission as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or
in addition to, the costs of the action.
(E)
As an alternative to the foregoing, a fire rescue assessment imposed against government property may be

571/653
(a)
Authorization. The stormwater management utility is empowered by this article to establish charges for the use
and discharge to the city's stormwater management system. Such charges shall be based on the cost of providing
stormwater management services to all properties within the city and may be different for properties receiving
different classes of service.
(b)
Rates for stormwater management service. There is charged to all owners or occupants of real property in the
city, with improvements or uses thereon which contribute stormwater runoff to the city's stormwater
management system, a monthly fee as established by separate ordinance in accordance with the following
definitions:
(1)
Single-family property service charges. Each single-family property shall be considered one (1) ERU for billing
purposes. Monthly service charges for each single-family dwelling unit shall be identical, provided that the ratio
of impervious area to total area of the lot does not exceed fifty (50) percent and the total area of the lot exceeds
ten thousand (10,000) square feet. If the ratio of impervious to total area exceeds fifty (50) percent and the total
area of the lot exceeds ten thousand (10,000) square feet, the rates established in subsection (b)(3) shall apply.
(2)
Multifamily property service charges. The monthly service charge for all multifamily properties shall be:
Duplex units = One ERU/dwelling unit
Condominium units = One ERU/dwelling unit
Apartment units = One ERU/dwelling unit
Town homes = One ERU/dwelling unit
Mobile homes = 0.6 ERU/dwelling unit
Definition of dwelling unit shall be those living areas served by individual electric and/or water meters.
(3)
Nonresidential/commercial property service charge.
Nonresidential/commercial property service charge shall be:

No. Billable ERU's = No. Base ERU's × (Credit Factor)
Monthly Service Charge = (No. Billable ERU's) × (Rate/ERU)
A minimum value of 1.0 ERU shall be assigned to nonresidential/commercial property unless such property has
earned a one hundred (100) percent retention credit, in which case, the property will only be charged a service
fee of ten (10) percent of 1.0 ERU. The impervious area of each nonresidential/commercial property shall be
determined by a registered professional engineer or surveyor.
(4)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
572/653
Application to all developed properties. Service charges shall apply to all developed properties within the city

Billing. The fees imposed by this article shall be billed on a monthly basis and may be billed in conjunction with
the property owner or property user's monthly water bill issued by the city through the City of Lauderhill. Such
fees shall be due and payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as other
utility fees. In the event a developed property does not have other city utility service(s), a new account shall be
developed and that property shall be billed separately for the storm water management charges. The city
manager or designee may create a new account for storm water utility billing purposes only for a property owner
or a property user that may also have a valid city electric and/or water utility account.

(a)
Any customer or property owner who feels that the stormwater management service charge for their property has
been assigned or computed incorrectly may petition in writing to the city manager or designee for a review of
such charges. If the city used a site plan to determine the drainage calculations, but the customer or property
owner has an updated site plan showing different calculations other than what the city calculated for the
impervious area, then the customer/owner must submit a copy of the signed and sealed updated as-built
information to the department of engineering and environmental services. If the city used an aerial to make the
calculation because no site plan was available, then the customer or property owner will be required to provide
the city with signed and sealed as-built information regarding their drainage system. If a new site plan is
provided, a registered professional engineer or surveyor on behalf of the city will review it to determine what
percentage of retention they qualify for based upon the updated information in order to determine the
appropriate retention credit, if any.

Sec. 21-45. - Definitions.
For the purposes of this article, the terms used herein shall be defined as follows:
Consumer: Any person, firm, association, corporation, agency or similar organization supplied with refuse
collection and water and/or sewer service by the department, sometimes referred to as the "customer."
Consumer's installation: All pipes, shutoffs, valves, fixtures and appliances or apparatus of every kind and nature
used in connection with or forming a part of an installation for utilizing water and sewer service for any purpose,
ordinarily located on the consumer's of "point of delivery," whether such installation is owned outright by the
consumer or used by the consumer under lease or otherwise.
Council: The duly elected authority of the city.
Department: The department of environmental and engineering services or its representative of the city, its office
address as currently shown on all department correspondence and customer bills. Hereinafter, sometimes
referred to as the "utility."

Main: Shall refer to a pipe, conduit or other facility installed to convey service to individual lines or other mains.
Point of delivery: The point where the department of environmental and engineering services' pipes or meters
are connected with pipes of the consumer, generally, at the property line, easement line or edge of a right-ofway.
Rate schedule: Refers to the rate or charge for the particular classification of service or services.
Refuse: All waste which is collected pursuant to the city's franchise for refuse collection, removal and disposal
as it now exists, or as it may be amended, extended, renewed or rewarded, and including garbage and trash
receptacles which are required pursuant to section 10-13 of the Code. Required payment for these garbage and
trash receptacles shall be included in refuse collection charges.
Service: As mentioned herein and in agreement with consumers, shall be construed to include, in addition to all
water service or sewer service required by the consumer, the readiness and ability on the part of the department
of environmental and engineering services to furnish such service to the consumer. Thus, the maintenance by the
department of the availability of service at the point of delivery upon request shall constitute the rendering of
service, regardless of whether the consumer makes any use thereof.
Service lines: The pipes of the department of environmental and engineering services which are connected from
the mains to the point of delivery.
(Ord. No. 87-164, §§ 1, 2, 1-25-88; Ord. No. 91-164, § 2, 9-1-91; Ord. No. 94-145, § 1, 9-12-94; Ord. No. 95-
149, § 2, 9-11-95)
Sec. 21-46. - Rules and regulations.
(a)
General information. The department's rules and regulations insofar as they are inconsistent with any statute, law
or legislation now in effect, shall be null and void. These rules and regulations are a part of the rate schedules,
applications and contracts of the department; and, in the absence of a specific written agreement to the contrary,
they apply without modifications or change to each and every consumer to whom the department renders
service.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
599/653
In the event that a portion of these rules and regulations is declared unconstitutional or void for any reason by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall in no way affect the validity of the remaining portions of
the rules and regulations for service unless such court order to decision shall so direct.
(b)
Water/sewer service. To obtain service, an application, if required, should be made at the office of the
department. Applications are accepted by the department with the understanding that there is no obligation on
the part of the department to render service other than that which is then available from its existing water
production and distribution equipment and service lines or its sewage treatment or collection system.
The applicant shall furnish to the department the correct name, street address and lot and block number at which
service is to be rendered.
(c)
Signed application necessary. For newly constructed buildings which have not had prior permanent utility
service, service shall be furnished only upon receipt of a signed application or agreement accepted by the
department. The conditions of such application or agreement shall be binding upon the consumer. A copy of
each application or agreement for service accepted by the department will be furnished to the applicant.
(d)
Service supplied only to owners. Utility service shall be provided to property owners, and not to tenants.
Acceptance of utility service by owners or tenants shall constitute an agreement by the owner to pay for the
service.
(e)
Withholding service. The department may withhold or discontinue service when the account becomes delinquent
as provided for herein or when an acceptable application is not provided.
(f)
Extensions. Water or sewer main extensions required shall be the responsibility of the developer/builder for
design and installation subject to approval by the city engineer. The department may require from the
developer/builder prepayments, cash advances, minimum guarantees, contribution in aid of construction or other
arrangements with the developer/builder whereby the department will be enabled to earn a fair and reasonable
return on the cost of providing and rendering the required service.
(g)
Limitation of use. All service purchased from the department shall be used by the consumer only for the
purposes specified by the department, and the consumer shall not sell or otherwise dispose of such service
supplied by the department. Service furnished to the consumer shall be rendered directly to the consumer
through the department's individual meter or connection and shall be for consumer's own use and may not be
remetered by the consumer for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of service to lessees, tenants or
others and under no circumstances shall the consumer or consumer's agent or any other individual association or
corporation install meters or pipes for the purpose of so remetering said service, except for the purpose of the
allocation of the direct cost of water and sewer service among multiple users, and then only pursuant to the city's
express approval and only to the extent thereof. Subject to the consent of the city commission and pursuant to
the terms of limitation of the applicable remetering agreement, a consumer may remeter the water service
provided by the city solely for the purposes of determining the use thereof among the consumer's lessees, tenants
or others who shall be lawfully entitled to receive same. Any owner or remeterer who has installed submeters
and who has been individually billing residents for water service prior to the adoption of this section shall have
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
600/653
ninety (90) days from the date of enactment to comply with the provisions of this section. In no case shall a
consumer, except with the written consent of the department, extend his lines across a street, alley, lane, court,
property line, avenue or other way, in order to furnish service for adjacent property. If such adjacent extension,
remetering, sale or disposition of service should occur, the consumer's service is subject to discontinuance until
such unauthorized extension, remetering, sale or disposition is discontinued and full payment is made of bills for
service calculated on proper classification and rate schedules and reimbursement in full made to the department
for all extra expenses incurred for clerical work, testing and inspections.
(h)
Continuity of service. The utility will at all times use reasonable diligence to provide continuous service and,
having used reasonable diligence, shall not be liable to the consumer for failure or interruption of continuous
service. The utility shall not be liable for any act or omission caused directly or indirectly by strikes, labor
troubles, accident, litigations, breakdowns, shutdowns for repairs or adjustments, acts of sabotage, enemies of
the United States, state, municipal or other governmental interference, acts of God or other causes beyond its
control.
(i)
Type and maintenance. The consumer's pipes, apparatus and equipment shall be selected, installed, used and
maintained in accordance with the standard practice, conforming with the rules and regulations of the
department and in full compliance with all laws and governmental regulations applicable to same. The consumer
agrees, further, to keep all pipes, valves and plumbing fixtures in repair and to promptly stop all leaks on his
premises; and the department shall not be responsible for their maintenance and operation. The consumer shall
not utilize any applicant or device which may adversely affect the service and the department reserves the right
to discontinue or withhold service to such apparatus or device.
(j)
Change of consumer's installation. No changes or increases in the consumer's installation which will materially
affect the proper operation of the pipes, mains or stations of the department shall be made without written
consent of the department. The consumer will be liable for any change resulting from a violation of this rule.
(k)
Inspection of consumer's installation. All of the consumer's service installations or changes shall be inspected
upon completion by competent authority to ensure that the consumer's piping, equipment and devices have been
installed in accordance with accepted standard practice and such local governmental or other rules as may be in
effect.
Where municipal or other governmental inspection is required by local rules or ordinances, the department
cannot render service until such inspection has been made, and a formal notice of approval from the inspecting
authority has been received by the department.
The department reserves the right to inspect the consumer's installation prior to rendering service and from time
to time thereafter, but assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any portion thereof.
(l)
Protection of utility's property. The consumer shall properly protect the utility's property on the consumer's
premises and shall permit no one but the utility's agents or persons authorized by law to have access to the
utility's pipes and apparatus.
In the event of any loss or damage to property of the utility caused by or arising out of carelessness, neglect or
other misuse by the consumer, the cost of making good such loss or repairing such damage shall be paid by the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
601/653
consumer.
(m)
Access to premises. The duly authorized agents of the department shall have access at all reasonable hours to the
premises of the consumer for the purpose of installing, maintaining and inspecting or removing the department's
property, reading meters and other purposes incident to the provision of, or termination of, service to the
consumer and, in such performance shall not be liable for trespass.
(n)
Right-of-way easements. The builder/developer or consumer shall grant or cause to be granted to the department
and without cost to the department all rights, easements, permits and privileges which, in the department's
opinion, are necessary for the rendering of service.
(o)
Billing period. Bills for water and sewer service will be rendered every month each bill to charge for the actual
usage for the prior month with the new billing period to begin effective October 1, 2006. Bills are due when
rendered and shall be considered as received by the consumer when mailed to the service address or some other
place mutually agreed upon.
(p)
Delinquent bills. Bills are due when rendered and, if not paid within twenty-five (25) days thereafter, become
delinquent, are subject to a one (1) percent penalty per billing cycle on the unpaid balance. The finance director
shall have the authority to waive a penalty fee at the customer's request if the customer has not been delinquent
in payments for the prior twelve (12) months; and service may then be discontinued after the due date. Notice
that service will be discontinued if the bill is not paid within twenty-five (25) days shall appear on the face of the
original bill. If a customer who is on the turn off list can prove at the time of turn off that payment has been
made in full, then the utility service will not be discontinued and a fee of only twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will
be assessed. If a service is discontinued, a disconnect fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) if made during normal working
hours, and seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if made during other than normal working hours, shall be added to the
outstanding balance due from the customer. A reading of the meter shall be taken when turned off and recorded.
Service will be resumed only upon payment of the total amount due, including penalties, unless a payment
arrangement is approved by the finance director. There shall be no liability of any kind against the city by reason
of discontinuance of service to the customer for failure of the customer to pay bills when due. Any fee which is
charged to the customer pursuant to section 21-46, shall constitute a delinquent payment. A partial payment, if
accepted, shall not be a waiver of the remaining balance due from the customer.
(q)
Reserved.
(r)
Reimbursement for extra expenses. The consumer shall reimburse the department for all extra expenses (such as
for special trips, inspections, additional clerical expenses, etc.) incurred by the department on account of the
consumer's violation of the contract for service or of the department's rules and regulations.
(s)
Payment of water, sewer and refuse service bills concurrently.
(1)
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
602/653
When a consumer is billed for refuse, water and sewer service, this subsection shall apply. Refuse collection,
water service and sewer service shall be billed concurrently, with refuse collection being billed at the time
prescribed in these rules and regulations [section 21-46] for billing of water and sewer service. If a customer
shall pay less than the entire bill, the payment shall be applied first to refuse collection, then to sewer service and
finally to water service. If the department shall discontinue water service due to nonpayment for the service, it
shall also discontinue sewer service. The department shall not reestablish or reconnect water and sewer service
until such time as all refuse collection charges, sewer service charges, water service charges and all other fees
and charges established by these rules and regulations are fully paid.
(2)
When a consumer is billed only for water and sewer service, this subsection shall apply. When both water and
sewer service are provided for by the department, payment of any water service bill rendered by the department
to a water service consumer shall not be accepted by the department without the simultaneous or concurrent
payment of any sewer service bill rendered by the department. If the charges for water service are not so paid,
the department may discontinue both sewer service and water services to the consumer's premises for
nonpayment of the water service charges or, if the charges for sewer service are not so paid, the department may
discontinue both water and sewer service to the consumer's premises for nonpayment of the sewer service
charge. The department shall not reestablish or reconnect sewer service and water service or either of such
services until such time as all sewer service charges and water service charges and all other expenses or charges
established or provided for by these rules and regulations [section 21-46] are paid.
(t)
Change of ownership. When a change of ownership of a property supplied with water and sewer service shall
occur, it shall be the obligation of the parties to the transaction to determine each party's obligation for its portion
of fees and costs incurred by this section. If requested, the city will supply a meter reading, in conjunction with a
lien search. There shall be an additional fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for the meter reading.
(u)
Unauthorized water connections. Connections to the department's water system for any purpose whatsoever are
to be made only by employees of the department. Unauthorized connections render the service subject to
immediate discontinuance without notice, and service will not be restored until such unauthorized connections
have been removed and unless settlement is made in full for all service estimated by the department to have been
used by reason of such unauthorized connection.
Any unauthorized connection or any consumer who tampers with a meter sealed by the department shall be
subject to a minimum charge of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) or actual cost incurred, whichever is larger,
to cover the cost of investigation, legal action, repairs or further protection of the department's product or
property. If the reading on a meter that is disconnected by the city is higher at the next reading than what the city
recorded as the reading at the time the meter was disconnected by the city, then the customer will be charged a
tampering fee and the meter will be removed until such time as all payments are made and the city reconnects
such service. Any illegal connection such as "jumper", tampering with service-locking device, bypassing of
meter or stolen meter shall be subject to a minimum charge of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or the actual costs
incurred, whichever is larger, to cover the cost of investigation, legal action, repairs or further protection of the
department's product or property. The meter will only be replaced after all outstanding balances and fees are
paid.
(v)
Meters. All water meters shall be furnished by and remain the property of the department and shall be accessible
to and subject to its control. The consumer shall provide meter space to the department at a suitable and readily
accessible location and, when the department considers it advisable within the premises to be served, adequate
and proper space for the installation of meters and other similar devices.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
603/653
(w)
All water through meter. That portion of the consumer's installation for water service shall be so arranged that all
water service shall pass through the meter. No temporary pipes, nipples, cross connections, or spacers are
permitted and under no circumstances are connections allowed which may permit water to bypass the meter or
metering equipment.
(x)
Adjustment of bills. When a consumer has been overcharged or undercharged as a result of incorrect application
of the rate schedules, incorrect reading of the meter, incorrect connection of the meter or other similar reasons,
the amount may be credited or billed to the consumer, as the case may be.
(y)
Deposit. A deposit shall be required for all two-inch meters and all meters not affixed to a permanent structure or
address. The amount of the deposit shall be as set forth in section 21-47.
(z)
Request for meter test by consumer. Should any consumer request a bench test of their water meter, the
department will require a fee to defray the cost of testing; such fee is not to exceed the following schedule of
fees:
Meter
Size
(inches)
Fees
5/8 and
¾ ..... $ 40.00
1 and
1½ ..... 60.00
2 ..... 100.00
All
others
.....
Cost by contract
If a meter is found to register in excess of the prescribed accuracy limits, the fee will be refunded; but if it is
below such accuracy limit, the fee will be retained by the department as a service charge for conducting the test.
(aa)
Adjustment of bills for meter error. The accuracy of the registration of the meter and its performance in service
shall be judged by its average error. The average meter error shall be considered to be the average of the errors at
the test-rate flows.
Fast meters: Whenever a meter tested is found to register fast in excess of the tolerance provided in the meter
accuracy requirements provision herein, the utility shall issue a credit to the consumer for the amount billed in
error for one-half (½) the period since the last test, said one-half (½) period not to exceed six (6) months; except
that if it can be shown that the error was due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the overcharge shall
be computed back to but not beyond such date. The credit shall not include any part of any minimum charge.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
604/653
Slow meters. Whenever a meter tested is found to register slow in excess of the tolerance provided in the meter
accuracy requirements provision herein, the utility may bill the consumer an amount equal to the unbilled error
for one-half (½) the period since the last test, said one-half (½) period not to exceed six (6) months; except that
if it can be shown that the error was due to some cause, the date of which can be fixed, the charge may be
computed back to but not beyond such date; and provided, further, that if the utility has required a deposit, the
consumer may be billed only for that portion of the unbilled error.
In the event of a nonregister meter, the consumer may be billed on an estimate based on previous bills for similar
usage, such estimate to apply only to the current billing period.
In the event of unauthorized use, the consumer may be billed on a reasonable estimate of the service taken.
Meter accuracy requirements. All meters used for measuring the quantity of water delivered to a consumer shall
be in good mechanical condition and shall be adequate in size and design for the type of service which they
measure. Before being installed for the use of any consumer, every water meter, whether new, repaired or
removed from service for any cause, shall be adjusted to register within the accuracy limits set forth in the
following table with accuracy limits in percent:
MAXIMUM INTERMEDIATE
Meter type Rate Rate New Repaired
Displacement
98.5 98.5 95 90
101.5 101.5 101.5 191.5
Current
97 97 95 90
103 103 103 103
Compound*
97 97 95 90
103 103 103 103
*The minimum required accuracy for compound meters at any rate within the "changeover" range of flows shall
be 85%.
(bb)
Failure of water service due to in-line valve shutoff. When city personnel are dispatched to a consumer's address
to turn on water service, and water is not being supplied to the consumer because the in-line valve is shut off, the
consumer shall be charged a fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) if the consumer's request is received between 8:00
a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. If the consumer's request is received at other hours or on Saturday,
Sunday, or a legal holiday, the consumer shall be billed a fee of thirty dollars ($30.00).
(cc)
Sewer stoppage on a consumer's property. When city personnel are utilized to clear a sewer stoppage which
occurs on the consumer's property inside the point of delivery, the consumer shall be charged a fee of fifty
dollars ($50.00) if the consumer's request is received between 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday,
and one hundred dollars ($100.00) if the consumer's request is received at other hours or on Saturday or Sunday,
or a legal holiday.
(dd)
Refuse service and billing. All services and charges relating to refuse collection shall be as set forth in the city's
franchise for refuse collection, removal and disposal services. Billing for refuse collection service shall be by the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
605/653
city, to the extent that it is required in the franchise for refuse collection, removal and disposal. All such billing
shall be pursuant to the terms of subsection(s).
(ee)
System price structure. Commencing December 1, 2007, and effective on the 1st of October of each year
thereafter, all water, sewer and stormwater availability charges (minimum service charge), service and
consumption rate charges then in effect will be adjusted automatically in an amount up to one hundred (100)
percent of the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index ("CPI") as determined in June of the calendar
year of adjustment to be necessary to cover the expenses to the city. If the CPI for any year is below zero, the
city would not be obligated to increase the rate charges for that year.
(ff)
[Owners of private lift stations.] Owners of private lift stations located within the City of Lauderhill shall be
required to:
(1)
Display emergency contact information on the station at all times. A failure to comply with this subsection shall
be subject to the issuance for such violation.
(2)
Provide maintenance records for the privately owned lift station when requested by the city.
(3)
If at any time the owner does not maintain the private lift station and the city determines that it has become a
public health and safety issue, then the city shall be entitled to conduct any necessary repairs to the station and
the owner shall immediately reimburse the city for any and all costs incurred to the city as a result of that repair.
If owner fails to reimburse the city within thirty (30) days, the city shall be entitled to place a lien on the real
property on which the lift station is located, which lien shall be payable with interest at the then current legal rate
of interest per annum and which lien shall be deemed to be a special assessment lien, equal in dignity to city and
county ad valorem taxes and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in or
to the real property. The payment of all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney's fees, penalties and
lien amounts shall be required before said lien shall be discharged or satisfied.

Sec. 21-65. - Policy.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
615/653
(a)
No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the
water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations, this article, and the South Florida Building
Code. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor, pursuant to Florida Statutes,
Section 403.855; Florida Administrative Code Chapter 62-555; the South Florida Building Code; and this
article, or any amendments thereto, if a backflow prevention device required by this article is not installed,
tested, maintained, and certified, or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed, bypassed,
or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or
defects are corrected by the customer-user.
(b)
The customer's system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the
city to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these
regulations, exist. Water service may be discontinued after reasonable notice to the customer-user if a violation
of this article exists on the premises; and such other precautionary measures may be taken as are deemed
necessary to eliminate any danger to the potable water. Water service shall not be restored until the danger has
been eliminated in compliance by the customer-user with the provisions of this article.
(c)
The customer-user has the primary responsibility of preventing contaminants and pollutants from entering
his/her water system and from entering the public water main or water source from his/her water system. The
customer-user shall protect his/her water system against actual or potential cross connections, to prevent
backflow, as required by this article, the South Florida Building Code, and all other applicable laws and
regulations. The customer-user shall assure that all protective devices are tested and maintained in the working
condition required. He/she shall assure that the necessary plumbing permits are obtained for new water supply
system installations, and for retrofits, alterations or repairs to existing systems, as required by this article, the
South Florida Building Code, and all other applicable laws and regulations. Retrofit installation of dual check
valve devices for single-family residential dwelling units only, where required, will not require a building
permit.
(d)
It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises where backflow prevention devices are installed to have
certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year or one (1) every two (2) years for singlefamily
residential connections only. In those instances where the city deems the hazard to be great enough, it
may require certified inspections at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense
of the water user and shall be performed by the device manufacturer's representative or by a certified tester
approved by the city or its designee. It shall be the duty of the city or its designee to see that these timely tests
are made. The customer-user shall notify the city or its designee in advance when the tests are to be undertaken
so that the city's representatives may witness the tests. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at
the expense of the customer-user whenever such devices are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs
and overhaul shall be kept and copies sent to the city. The city shall determine by resolution to require a
rectification fee herein authorized at the time an occupational license is applied for. An occupational license
shall be issued by the city when the director of D.E.E.S., his/her designee, or the building official has determined
that an appropriate backflow prevention system, as required, is in place at the location and is properly
functioning.

backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the
degree of hazard.
(2)
In the case of premises upon which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such
a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public system shall be
protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line
appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating

impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be
protected against backflow or backsiphonage from the premises by installation of a backflow prevention device
in the service line. In this case, maximum protection will be required; that is, an approved air-gap separation or
an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed in each service to the
premises.

Company, its successors or assigns, subject to the terms and conditions of this ordinance, a nonexclusive
franchise to render gas service to the inhabitants of the city and grants to Florida Public Utilities Company the
privilege of rendering such service for the full term of this franchise. Wherever used herein, the term Florida

necessary or useful in the exercise of the franchise granted but in accordance with Florida Statutes. In the event
that any plant for the manufacture or processing of any gas is constructed and operated in any such area, the
same shall be operated in such manner as to prevent its being or becoming a public nuisance by the emanation of
unreasonable amounts of smoke, odors or noises of a nature to offend a substantial portion of the inhabitants of
the immediate vicinity of such operations.
Section 4. Florida Public Utilities Company is hereby granted the privilege of using the streets, alleys, roads
and other public rights-of-way in the city for carrying into effect the privileges granted by this ordinance; and
Florida Public Utilities Company is further authorized to make all necessary excavations therein to install, repair
or replace such pipes, mains or other facilities essential and useful in the distribution of gas from outside sources
to places of storage or to mains for ultimate distribution to consumers.
Section 5. Florida Public Utilities Company, at no cost to the city, shall restore all such streets, alleys, roads
and other public rights-of-way to their original condition with due and reasonable dispatch and with the least
practicable interference with or inconvenience to the rights of the public and individuals in and to such streets,
alleys, roads and other public rights-of-way.
Section 6. In the event that any obstruction or excavation caused by Florida Public Utilities Company shall
remain longer than three (3) days after notice from the city to remove the same, or in the event of failure by
Florida Public Utilities Company to protect any dangerous places by proper guards or warning devices, the city
may remove, fill or protect the same at the expense of Florida Public Utilities Company.
Section 7. In installing, repairing or replacing pipes or mains or in excavating in connection with any other
purposes of Florida Public Utilities Company, Florida Public Utilities Company shall conform to all regulations
which are or may be prescribed by the city and shall not interfere with or injure any water pipes, drains or

pipelines, cables or sewers or doing any underground work in any public right-of-way or relocating, changing,
moving or excavating any public right-of-way. The city shall not be liable to Florida Public Utilities Company
for any damage caused thereby unless willfully done. The city may require Florida Public Utilities Company to
alter or relocate its system to facilitate this work, and said alteration or relocation shall be done forthwith with no
reimbursement from the city. Notice shall be given to Florida Public Utilities Company by the city at least seven
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
622/653

Company shall cooperate with the city by advising the city of the location of its facilities prior to such
commencement.
Section 9. Florida Public Utilities Company, as an express condition of the granting of this franchise, shall
save the city harmless from any claims resulting from damage or injury to persons or property caused by the
neglect or mismanagement of itself or of any of its employees or agents while engaged in constructing or
operating its works; and should any claim be made or suit brought against the city, it shall be the duty of Florida
Public Utilities Company upon demand to defend or settle the same and otherwise save the city harmless by
virtue of any such actions or by virtue of the recovery of any judgment in connection therewith, including all
costs and attorney fees, whether at the trial level or at the appellate level.
Section 10. The provisions of this ordinance and the nonexclusive franchise thereunder shall be deemed to be
an irrevocable contract between the city and Florida Public Utilities Company for a period of ten (10) years from
the effective date hereof. Florida Public Utilities Company and the city shall have the option to extend the same
for two (2) additional ten-year periods upon mutual consent. Florida Public Utilities Company shall exercise
each option by notice by certified or registered mail to the city clerk at least six (6) months prior to the
expiration of each option period. Acceptance thereof by the city shall be by resolution of the city council within
thirty (30) days after the receipt by the city of Florida Public Utilities Company's offer to exercise the option. No
competitive bidding shall be required for the exercise of either option. The offer by Florida Public Utilities
Company to exercise the option shall constitute an agreement by Florida Public Utilities Company to accept all
of the terms and conditions of this ordinance for the subsequent ten-year option period. Other than at the end of
each ten-year option period, the provisions hereof and the franchise granted hereunder may not be sooner
terminated except by voluntary surrender in writing by Florida Public Utilities Company or by action to declare
the same forfeited for violation or nonperformance by Florida Public Utilities Company. Such action may be
instituted only by the city and only pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 hereof.
Section 11. In the event of any violation or nonperformance by Florida Public Utilities Company of the terms
of this franchise, the city council shall adopt a resolution specifying the violation or nonperformance and shall
fix a date for a public hearing to be held not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the
effective date of such resolution. Within five (5) days from the effective date of said resolution, a certified copy
thereof shall be forwarded by registered or certified mail to Florida Public Utilities Company. At the hearing,
Florida Public Utilities Company shall be permitted to offer evidence that no violation was committed or that it
was not guilty of nonperformance and shall also be permitted to offer evidence of compliance or performance
subsequent to the date of any violation or nonperformance. Should the city council find that as of the date of the
hearing there is noncompliance or nonperformance by Florida Public Utilities Company, it shall adopt a
resolution so finding. If, within thirty (30) days of the effective date of such resolution, or within such longer
period of time as may be fixed by the city council, Florida Public Utilities Company shall not have performed or
complied, the city may declare the franchise to be terminated by further resolution of the city council. Florida
Public Utilities Company shall have the right to appeal such action to the Broward County Circuit Court within
thirty (30) days from the date of resolution declaring the franchise to be terminated. Provided, however, should
there be a stoppage, interruption or other failure in service attributable to causes other than fault on the part of
Florida Public Utilities Company, then and in the event, such stoppage, interruption or other failure of service
shall not be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance unless Florida Public Utilities Company shall not resume
service within thirty (30) days or any longer period as may be fixed by the city council after the cause of such
stoppage, interruption or failure of service ceased to exist or conditions created thereby were remedied.
Section 12. A forfeiture of this franchise shall be limited to a denial of the nonexclusive privilege of rendering
gas services as herein contained and shall not extend to any taking of any of the property of Florida Public
Utilities Company. In the event that a forfeiture is declared, Florida Public Utilities Company shall cease to use
its plant and equipment within sixty (60) days of the date that the forfeiture is declared.
Section 13. In the event that Florida Public Utilities Company chooses to remove its property from the public
rights-of-way, it shall post bond with the city in the penal sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars
($150,000.00) conditioned upon restoration by Florida Public Utilities Company of such rights-of-way to their
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
623/653
condition prior to the commencement of work in connection with the removal of such property unless said
removal shall be caused by an act or ordinance initiated by the city.
Section 14. No sale, assignment or transfer of the rights granted by this franchise shall be effective unless
Florida Public Utilities Company shall file a written notice with the city sixty (60) days prior to the date of sale,
assignment or transfer, and the city shall have approved the sale, assignment or transfer. Said approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld.
Section 15. Florida Public Utilities Company shall maintain at all times at a place within the city all records
necessary to show compliance with Lauderhill City Code Sections 19-16 through 19-23, as they now exist or
may be amended or renumbered, and shall give access to the city to review same Monday through Friday from
8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. upon one (1) day's notice.
Section 16. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed a prohibition against any other liquefied petroleum
(propane gas) distributor from doing business in the city or from utilizing storage or distribution facilities within
the city in accordance with local and state laws.
Section 17. If any section, paragraph, clause or phrase or application thereof to any person or circumstances
shall be construed by a court of appropriate jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such finding shall not
affect the rest of this ordinance or the application of such section, paragraph, clause or phrase to other persons
and other circumstances, it being the intention of the city council to pass this ordinance without any such
unconstitutional section, paragraph, clause or phrase or application thereof.
Section 18. All ordinances or parts of ordinances, all resolutions, or parts of resolutions in conflict herewith be

ARTICLE IV. - ELECTRICITY
ORDINANCE NO. 07O-04-125
An ordinance amending the Code of Ordinances, Appendix G - Franchises, Article IV, Electricity; repealing and
replacing Ordinance No. 79-117; granting to Florida Power & Light Company ("FP&L"), it successors and
assigns, a non-exclusive electric franchise, imposing provisions and conditions relating thereto, providing for
monthly payments to the City of Lauderhill; providing for an effective date (requested by city manager, Charles
Faranda)
WHEREAS, the City Commission of the City of Lauderhill, Florida recognizes that the City of Lauderhill and
its citizens need and desire the continued benefits of electric service; and
WHEREAS, the provision of such service requires substantial investments of capital and other resources in
order to construct, maintain and operate facilities essential to the provision of such service in addition to costly
administrative functions, and the City of Lauderhill does not desire to undertake to provide such services at this
time; and
WHEREAS, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) is a public utility which has the demonstrated ability to
supply such services; and
WHEREAS, there is currently in effect a franchise agreement between the City of Lauderhill and FPL, the terms
of which are set forth in City of Lauderhill Ordinance No. 79-117, passed and adopted May 2, 1979, and FPL's
written acceptance thereof dated May 29, 1979, granting to FPL, its successors and assigns, a thirty (30) year
electric franchise ("Current Franchise Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, FPL and the City of Lauderhill desire to enter into a new agreement (New Franchise Agreement)
providing for the payment of fees to the City of Lauderhill in exchange for the nonexclusive right and privilege
of supplying electricity and other services within the City of Lauderhill free of competition from the City of
Lauderhill, pursuant to certain terms and conditions, and
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
630/653
WHEREAS, the City Commission of the City of Lauderhill deems it to be in the best interest of the City of
Lauderhill and its citizens to enter into the New Franchise Agreement prior to expiration of the Current
Franchise Agreement;
Now, therefore, be it ordained by the City Commission of the City of Lauderhill, Florida:
Section 1. There is hereby granted to Florida Power & Light Company, its successors and assigns (hereinafter
called the "grantee"), for the period of thirty (30) years from the effective date hereof, the nonexclusive right,
privilege and franchise (hereinafter called "franchise") to construct, operate and maintain in, under, upon, along,
over and across the present and future roads, streets, alleys, bridges, easements, rights-of-way and other public
places (hereinafter called "public rights-of-way") throughout all of the incorporated areas, as such incorporated
areas may be constituted from time to time, of the City of Lauderhill, Florida, and its successors (hereinafter
called the "grantor"), in accordance with the grantee's customary practice with respect to construction and
maintenance, electric light and power facilities, including, without limitation, conduits, poles, wires,
transmission and distribution lines, and all other facilities installed in conjunction with or ancillary to all of the
grantee's operations (hereinafter called "facilities"), for the purpose of supplying electricity and other services to
the grantor and its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and persons beyond the limits thereof.
Section 2. The facilities of the grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as to not unreasonably interfere
with traffic over the public rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. To
avoid conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the
grantor may prescribe in accordance with the grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the
placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way; provided, however,
that such rules or regulations (a) shall not prohibit the exercise of the grantee's right to use said public rights-ofway
for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic, (b) shall not unreasonably
interfere with the grantee's ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of
its customers, and (c) shall not require the relocation of any of the grantee's facilities installed before or after the
effective date hereof in public rights-of-way unless or until widening or otherwise changing the configuration of
the paved portion of any public right-of-way used by motor vehicles causes such installed facilities to
unreasonably interfere with motor vehicular traffic. Such rules and regulations shall recognize that above-grade
facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of
the public rights-of-way to the extent possible. When any portion of a public right-of-way is excavated by the
grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the public right-of-way so excavated
shall within a reasonable time be replaced by the grantee at its expense and in as good condition as it was at the
time of such excavation. The grantor shall not be liable to the grantee for any cost or expense in connection with
any relocation of the grantee's facilities required under subsection (c) of this section, except, however, the
grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs from others and as may be provided by law.
Section 3. The grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the
construction, operation or maintenance by the grantee of its facilities hereunder, and the acceptance of this
ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the grantee to indemnify the grantor and hold it harmless
against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the grantor by reason of the
negligence, default or misconduct of the grantee in the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities
hereunder.
Section 4. All rates and rules and regulations established by the grantee from time to time shall be subject to
such regulation as may be provided by law.
Section 5. As a consideration for this franchise, the grantee shall pay to the grantor, commencing 90 days after
the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this franchise, an amount
which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever
(except ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the
grantor against the grantee's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the grantee's
monthly billing period ending sixty (60) days prior to each such payment will equal 5.9 percent of the grantee's
billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
631/653
customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff) within the incorporated areas of the grantor for the
monthly billing period ending sixty (60) days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the
rights and privileges granted herein exceed 5.9 percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the
grantee.
The grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited, as in
the existing franchise Ordinance No. 79-117, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues
do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for Public
Street and Highway Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to
Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to
Railroads and Railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for
Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field
Collection Charges; (h) other service charges.
Section 6. If during the term of this franchise the grantee enters into a franchise agreement with any other
municipality located in Broward County, Florida, where the number of grantee's active electrical customers is
equal to or less than the number of grantee's active electrical customers within the City of Lauderhill, the terms
of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the grantee at a rate above 5.9 percent of the grantee's
residential, commercial and industrial revenues (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff), under the same
terms and conditions as specified in Section 5 hereof, the grantee, upon written request of the grantor, shall
negotiate and enter into a new franchise agreement with the grantor in which the percentage to be used in
calculating monthly payments under Section 5 hereof shall be no greater than that percentage which the grantee
has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to the other Broward County municipality, provided,
however, that such new franchise agreement shall include additional benefits to the grantee, in addition to all
benefits provided herein, at least equal to those provided by its franchise agreement with the other Broward
County municipality. Subject to all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the
grantor shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments,
and the grantee shall have the sole discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under any
such new franchise agreement.
Section 7. As a further consideration, during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof, the grantor
agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with the grantee, of electric capacity
and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer") or to
any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the grantee,
(b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to
obligate the grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third
party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek to have the grantee transmit and/or
distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy generated by or on behalf of the grantor at one location to the
grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the grantor from engaging
with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power
Act.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or
electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the grantee transmit and/or distribute to any
facility(ies) of the grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the grantor from any other
person; provided, however, that before the grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy
from any other person, the grantor shall notify the grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific
rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the grantor's facilities to be
served under the offer. The grantee shall thereafter have ninety (90) days to evaluate the offer and, if the grantee
offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the grantor
shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the
previously-identified facilities of the grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the
grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of the
terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
632/653
Section 8. If the grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other
such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the
incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions
which the grantee determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the grantee
may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time
period provided hereafter. The grantee shall give the grantor at least sixty (60) days advance written notice of its
intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein,
advise the grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable. The grantor shall then have
sixty (60) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the grantee.
If the grantee determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the grantor within said time period,
the grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's clerk and
termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice.
Section 9. If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States
of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision
of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the grantor
to a customer then being served by the grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the
incorporated areas of the grantor in which the grantee may lawfully serve, and the grantee determines that its
obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a
competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the grantee may, at any time after the taking of such
action, terminate this franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided
hereafter.
The grantee shall give the grantor at least ninety (90) days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such
notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the grantee herein, advise the grantor of the
consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The grantor shall then have ninety
(90) days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive
disadvantage is not remedied by the grantor within said time period, the grantee may terminate this franchise
agreement by delivering written notice to the grantor's clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of
delivery of such notice.
Section 10. Failure on the part of the grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of
this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or
propriety thereof is protested by the grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion
of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the grantee has failed to comply in a substantial
respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the grantee shall have six months after such final
determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the grantor at its
discretion to grant such additional time to the grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require.
Section 11. Failure on the part of the grantor to comply in substantial respect with any of the provisions of this
ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than
unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way
contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the
grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this
franchise and entitle the grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until
such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the
matter. The grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver of the grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the grantee, in its sole
discretion, may exercise such right.
Section 12. The grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within ninety (90) days after each anniversary date of
this franchise, at the grantor's expense, examine the records of the grantee relating to the calculation of the
franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal
business hours at the grantee's office where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the grantee in
the ordinary course of business may be provided at the grantor's expense and as the grantor and the grantee may
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
633/653
agree in writing. Information identifying the grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not
be taken from the grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease
or increase payment to the grantor, shall be reported to the grantee. The grantor's right to examine the records of
the grantee in accordance with this section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the grantor
whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit.
Grantor waives, settles and bars all claims relating in any way to the amounts paid by the grantee under the
current franchise agreement embodied in Ordinance No. 79-117.
Section 13. The provisions of this ordinance are interdependent upon one another, and if any of the provisions of
this ordinance are found or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, void or of no effect, the entire ordinance shall be null
and void and of no force or effect.
Section 14. As used herein "person" means an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a business trust, a joint
stock company, a trust, an incorporated association, a joint venture, a governmental authority or any other entity
of whatever nature.
Section 15. Ordinance No. 79-117, passed and adopted May 2, 1979, and all other ordinances and parts of
ordinances and all resolutions and parts of resolutions in conflict herewith, are hereby repealed.
Section 16. As a condition precedent to the taking effect of this ordinance, the grantee shall file its acceptance
hereof with the grantor's clerk within thirty (30) days of adoption of this ordinance. The effective date of this
ordinance shall be the date upon which the grantee files such acceptance.
Section 17. This agreement is hereby approved subject to the review and approval of the city attorney.

Section 1. - Franchise Grant.
In consideration of the faithful performance and observation of the conditions and reservations herein specified
and in consideration of the payments of the amounts provided herein, the right is hereby granted to Lauderhill
Communications Corporation hereinafter referred to as "company," its successors, assigns or designees, to erect,
maintain and operate a cable television service to be provided authorizing the use of public easements and
rights-of-way for such purposes in the City of Lauderhill, Florida, hereinafter referred to as "city," and
subsequent additions thereto, for the purpose of transmission and distribution of audio and visual impulses and
radio and television energy as hereinafter defined and restricted in accordance with the laws and regulations of
the United States of America, the State of Florida and the ordinances and regulations of the city for the period
provided for in this ordinance.
Section 2. - Definition.
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
635/653
Whenever used in this ordinance, the word "television" shall mean a system for the transmission of audio signals
and visual images by means of electrical impulses, for such purposes as those included in Section 14.
Section 3. - Poles and Appurtenances.
To the extent possible, company shall make attachments to poles already in existence within the city. To the
extent that existing poles are insufficient for its purposes, or if company is unable to negotiate agreements
satisfactory to it for use of existing poles, company shall have the right, subject to approval by the city and as
further restricted herein, to erect and maintain its own poles or underground system as necessary for the
construction and maintenance of its distribution system with the approval of locating such poles by the city.
(A)
The company's transmission and distribution system poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and
maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives or persons or to interfere with new improvements the
city may deem proper to make, or hinder unnecessarily or obstruct the free use of alleys, streets, bridges or other
public property. Such installations shall be made as to preserve the best possible esthetic standards in the
community.
(B)
It is the stated intention of city that all holders of public licenses and franchises within the corporate limits of
city shall cooperate with company wherever possible and wherever such usage does not interfere with the
normal operation of said poles and pole lines, so that the number of new or additional poles constructed by
company may be minimized.
(C)
Company shall extend to city, free of expense, joint use of any and all poles owned by it for any proper
municipal purpose insofar as may be accomplished without interference with the use and enjoyment of
company's own cables and fixtures. City shall hold company harmless from any and all actions, choices of
action or damage caused by the placement of city's wires and appurtenances upon the poles of the company.
(D)
Company shall have the authority, subject to jurisdiction of the city, to trim trees over and overhanging all
streets, alleys, easements, sidewalks and other public places within city so as to prevent the branches of such

promptly follow such demand while the dispute is being resolved. Furthermore, in the event that the company
shall have failed to remove the objectionable advertising within said forty-eight-hour period, the city shall have
an absolute right to cause such advertisement to be removed, and the city shall not be responsible for any
damages in connection therewith.
f.

operations and uses under this contract and shall defend all suits in the name of the city, its officials and/or
employees and shall pay all costs and judgments which may issue thereon except those which arise from any

the control of the company. The limit of this indemnity by the company shall be one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) per claim.
[Section] 5. - Installation of shelters.
The company agrees to install no more than fifty (50) new shelters at locations other than those locations set
forth on Exhibit A during the term of this contract. The parties shall mutually agree as to the location of shelters
to be installed up to the maximum number allowed. Nothing contained in this section or in any other provision
of this contract shall be construed so as to require the company to construct and install more than fifty (50)
additional shelters in the city during the original term hereof. All bus shelters installed during the term of the
11/8/2019 Lauderhill, FL Code of Ordinances
648/653
contract shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of the South Florida Building Code or other
applicable technical codes and shall only be installed at existing Broward County Transit stops.
[Section] 6. - Continuing maintenance obligation.
The company shall maintain all of the shelters which it installs. The company shall clean three (3) feet away
from each side of the shelter all trash and debris within the public right-of-way, including curb and gutter. Said
trash and debris shall be removed biweekly from the public right-of-way. Further, the company shall be
responsible for the cleaning, repairing, or replacement of all bus shelter parts, including advertising materials,
signs and visual displays placed upon the shelters. However, the company shall not be responsible for the
maintenance or repair of any sidewalks, walkways or curbs to which the shelters are attached unless such
sidewalks, walkways or curbs shall have been damaged through the acts or omission of the company, its agents,
servants, subcontractors or employees except for those portions of the sidewalks, walkways or curb located
within the shelters themselves which the company shall be responsible for maintaining at its own cost and
expense. In the event a shelter is not maintained in good repair and in clean condition as determined by the city,
the city shall so notify the company verbally followed by a letter of confirmation. If the condition is not
corrected to the city's satisfaction within five (5) working days after the date of notice, the city shall have the
right and privilege to remove said shelter and charge the company for the costs of such removal (inclusive of
personnel expense, labor and materials). Should the city determine that there is an immediate danger to the
health, welfare or safety of the general public, the city shall so notify verbally, and the company shall remove
any such dangerous condition within twenty-four (24) hours. If the condition is not corrected within twenty-four
(24) hours, the city has absolute right to correct the condition and bill the company for such.
[Section] 7. - Right of company to remove individual shelters.
Except as provided for in this section, the company shall not remove any shelters installed at a bus stop location
during the term of this contract without first having obtained the written consent of the city. In the case of
chronic vandalism of a particular shelter, the company must first give written notice to the city of any damaged
shelters the company believes are subject to chronic vandalism, and the city shall have a twenty-one-day period
of time to correct such problems. If the city is unable to correct ongoing problems or cannot give reasonable
assurances for the safety of the shelter at that location, then it is agreed that the company shall have the right to
remove individual shelters (after ten (10) days' written notice to the city) without seeking prior approval from the
city in the event that such shelters have been subjected to chronic vandalism. For the purposes hereof, the phrase
chronic vandalism shall be defined as damages inflicted to an individual shelter during any three-consecutivemonth
period which require cumulative expenditures for replacements and repair that exceed one thousand
dollars ($1,000.00).
[Section] 8. - Relocation of shelters.
In the event of a change in bus stop or other transportation system designations, changes in street design or rightof-
way which materially affect the pedestrian and vehicular traffic flow at or near shelters established in
connection herewith, the company at the city's written request shall relocate a designated shelter to another
location mutually agreed upon by the city and the company. The expense in connection with such relocation
shall be borne by the company, and the company shall act expeditiously in order to relocate such shelters; and in
the event that a change of street design or right-of-way location shall require the relocation of a shelter, the
company shall coordinate its work with the contractors or other personnel performing labor in connection with
the change of street design or right-of-way location in order to accomplish the relocation expeditiously and
without interference to the work in connection with the relocation of streets or rights-of-way.

forty-five (45) days of receipt of notice of such default; in which case, the defaulting party shall have such
amount of time reasonably necessary to cure such default. In the event that the city feels that the company is not
curing the default within a reasonable time, the city may file a lawsuit seeking any and all remedies available to
the city at law or in equity. Neither party shall be obligated to perform, and neither shall be deemed to be in

sooner than fifteen (15) days from the date required for the material default to be cured as more specifically

PREFACE 
    This volume contains the City of Lauderhill Land Development Regulations, adopted as Appendix A to the Code of Ordinances of the City by Ordinance No. 90-126, enacted June 11, 1990. 
    The regulations have been printed as submitted by the City and, except as otherwise noted, the original numbering system has been retained. Obvious typographical errors have been corrected without notation. Words or phrases added by the editor for purposes of clarification are enclosed in brackets. 
Amendatory Legislation 
    A feature of this publication that is particularly useful is the table of amendments. Any amendatory legislation may be located therein by number and date of enactment, and the sections or subsections amended will be listed. In addition, the sources of any amendments to a section are listed in a parenthetical history note following the amended section. The absence of such a note indicates that the section derives unamended from the regulations as originally adopted. 
Index 
    As part of the publication project, a comprehensive index was prepared. Each particular subject has been placed under several headings, some couched in lay phraseology and others in legal terminology. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    Another special feature of this volume is the supplemental service, by which the publication will be kept up to date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendments, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication with instructions for the manner of inserting the pages and deleting the obsolete pages. The instruction sheet for the most current supplement should be placed in the front of the volume, and it is recommended that deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
Acknowledgements 
    This volume is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Lauderhill, Florida. This Publication was under the direct supervision of Connie Timmons and Rhonda A. Reid, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers would also like to extend their sincere appreciation to the City officials for their cooperation and assistance throughout the publication of the volume.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of these Land Development Regulations to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

the City Commission finds: 
a.  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
b.  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one (1) area. 
c.  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the City's rationale for these regulations, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the City's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects. 
    5.2.2 Separation requirements. It shall be unlawful to establish, operate, or cause to be operated a sexually oriented business in Lauderhill, unless said sexually oriented business is at least one hundred (100) feet from all parcels occupied by a public, charter, or private primary or secondary school. For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a straight line in all directions without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the nearest point of the property line boundary where the sexually oriented business is located to the nearest point of the property line boundary where the school is located.

A.  Findings, conclusions and intent. The City Commission makes the following findings, conclusions and intent: 
1.  The finding that before March 28 th , 2005, vehicular-related uses were allowed within the zoning district as a special exception use; and 
2.  The finding that before February 25 th , 2002, a special exception use development order for a vehicular related use at a specific location could be transferred from one owner to another; and 
3.  The finding that Ordinance No. 020-02-109 provides that effective February 25 th , 2002, a special exception use development order for a vehicular related use cannot be transferred from one person to another; and 
4.  The finding that Ordinance No. 050-03-120 provides that effective March 28 th , 2005, any vehicular-related use within the CP-O zoning district is a prohibited use; and 
5.  The conclusion that an internal inconsistency exists between the CP-O zoning district and the CW zoning district because the CW zoning district allows indoor and outdoor vehicular related uses, including auto wreaking, while the CP-O zoning district prohibits such use; and 
6.  The conclusion that to resolve the internal inconsistency, the CW zoning district provisions must be amended to prohibit vehicular related uses, including auto wreaking services; and 
7.  The finding that three vehicular related use businesses are operating at a location where a special exception use development order was issued to allow such use at such location; however, all three businesses operate a use that was prohibited by the development order. A fourth vehicular related use business is operating at a location different from that authorized in the special exception use development order but within the same building; and 
8.  The finding the City issued an occupational license to each of these four businesses before April 1 st , 2000, effectively allowing the operation of the vehicular related uses, and the finding the City subsequently has granted annually a renewal of the occupational license for each business; and 
9.  The conclusion that case law provides that a land use is not vested simply because the local government has mistakenly issued an occupational license for the use; and 
10.  The conclusion that terminating these long-standing business on the mistaken issuance or renewal of an occupational license would create significant hardship, financial loss, and lost jobs, and that additional time should be granted to allow for the relocation of the businesses from the district; and 
11.  The intent of this Subsection is to allow those businesses along NW 38 th Avenue to continue to operate as legal nonconforming uses until September 30 th , 2017 can make significant investments, that these investments would be lost if the City immediately terminates the business, and that these businesses should be provide additional time to relocate. 
B.  Legal nonconforming use amortization. Any person operating an illegal non-conforming vehicular related use within the CW/CP-O zoning district or any successor zoning district who was issued an occupational license before April 1 st , 2000 and who has annually received a renewal of their occupational license shall be classified as a legal nonconforming vehicular related use and shall be allowed to continue to operate at the currently licensed location until September 30 th , 2017, provided conformance with one of the following factors is established: 
1.  The person was granted a special exception use development order to operate a vehicular related use at a specific location but is now operating at a different business address; or 
2.  The person is operating a vehicular related use pursuant at the location specified in an effectively transferred special exception use development order for a vehicular related use but the person is operating a specific vehicular related use outside the scope of the development order.

    Cross access : A service drive providing vehicular access between two (2) or more contiguous sites so that the driver need not enter the public street system. Also, a pedestrian path between two (2) or more contiguous sites so that the pedestrian need not use the public sidewalk system. 
    Joint or shared access : A driveway connecting two (2) or more contiguous sites to the public street system. 
    Outparcel : A parcel of land abutting and external to the larger, main parcel, which is typically in separate ownership and which has roadway frontage. 
    Nonconforming access feature: Features of the access system of a property that existed prior to April 28, 2003 and do not conform with the standards and requirements of these Land Development Regulations or with the standards and requirements of the Florida Department of Transportation, as currently codified in Florida Administrative Code Rule 14-97. 
    Reasonable access : The minimum number of access connections, direct or indirect, necessary to provide safe access to and from the thoroughfare, as consistent with the intent of these Land Development Regulations and the Florida Department of Transportation access management rule. 
    Stub-out or stub-street : A portion of a street or cross access drive used as an extension to an abutting property that may be developed in the future. 
    Substantial change in trip generation : A change in the use of the property, including land, structures or facilities, or an expansion of the size of the structures or facilities causing and increase in the trip generation of the property exceeding ten (10) percent more trip generation (either peak or daily) and one hundred (100) vehicles per day more than the existing use for all roads under City or County jurisdiction; or one hundred (100) vehicles per day more than the existing use for al roads under state jurisdiction, as defined in Section 335.18, Florida Statutes. 
    Substantial enlargements or improvements : A ten (10) percent increase in the existing square footage or a fifty (50) percent increase in the accessed valuation of the structure. 
    6.3.3. Joint and Cross Access. 
A.  Abutting properties within a commercial zoning district shall provide a cross access vehicular drive and pedestrian path to allow circulation between and among the properties. 
B.  A system of joint use driveway and cross access agreements be established, where feasible, and the property shall incorporate the following: 
1.  A continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each block served to provide for driveway separation consistent with the access management classification system and standards; 
2.  A design speed of ten (10) mph and sufficient width to accommodate two-way travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles and loading vehicles; 
3.  Stub-outs and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross access via a service drive; 
4.  A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged, where feasible. 
C.  Pursuant to subsection 6.3.3., property owners shall: 
1.  Record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint use driveways and cross access or service drive; 
2.  Record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the thoroughfare will be dedicated to the City, County or State and pre-existing driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of the joint-use driveway; 
3.  Record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property owners. 
D.  The Department of Environmental and Engineering Services Director may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical, provided all of the following requirements are met: 
1.  Joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section; 
2.  The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section; 
3.  The property owner shall enter a written agreement with the City, County or State, recorded with the deed, that pre-existing connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint use driveway. 
E.  The Department of Environmental and Engineering Services Director may modify or waive the requirements of this subsection where the characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation system impractical. 
    6.3.4. Requirements for Outparcels and Phased Development Plans. 
A.  In the interest of promoting unified access and circulation systems, development sites under the same ownership or consolidation for the purposes of development and comprised of more than one (1) building site shall not be considered separate properties in relation to access management requirements of these Land Development Regulations. The number of connections permitted shall be the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access to these properties, not the maximum available for that frontage. All necessary easements, agreements, and stipulations required under subsection 6.3.3. shall be met. 
B.  All access to the outparcel must be internalized using the shared circulation system of the principle development or retail center. Access to outparcels shall be designed to avoid excessive movement across parking aisles and queuing across surrounding parking and driving aisles. 
C.  The number of outparcels shall not exceed one (1) per ten (10) acres of site area, with a minimum linear street frontage of three hundred (300) linear feet per outparcel or greater where access spacing standards for that roadway require. This frontage requirement may be waived where access is internalized using the shared circulation system of the principle development or retail center. In such cases the right of direct access to the roadway shall be dedicated to the City, County or State and recorded with the deed. 
    6.3.5. Nonconforming Access Features. 
A.  Previously permitted access connections in place as of April 28, 2003, that do not conform with the standards herein shall be designated as nonconforming features and shall be brought into compliance with applicable standards under the following conditions: 
1.  When new access connection permits are requested; 
2.  Substantial enlargements or improvements; 
3.  Significant change in trip generation; or 
4.  As roadway improvements allow. 
B.  If the principal activity on a property with nonconforming access features is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty (180) days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity, then that property must thereafter be brought into conformity with all applicable connection spacing and design requirements, unless otherwise exempted by the permitting authority. For uses that are vacant or discontinued upon the effective date of this section, the one hundred eighty (180) day period begins on the effective date. 
    6.3.6. Relief From Access Requirements and Restrictions. 
A.  Regulatory flexibility. The Planning and Zoning Board may permit departure from dimensional lot, yard and bulk standards and requirements of the zoning district where a development is proposed to encourage creativity in site design, protect natural resources, and advance the intent of the access provisions in these Land Development Regulations. Such regulatory modifications under this paragraph are not subject to variance approval by the Board of Adjustment. 
B.  Variance standards. 
1.  The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the purpose and intent of these regulations and shall not be considered until every feasible option for meeting access standards is explored. 
2.  Applicants for a variance from these standards must provide to the City Commission, sitting as the Board of Adjustment, proof of unique or special conditions that make strict application of the provisions impractical. This shall include proof that: 
a.  Indirect or restricted access cannot be obtained; 
b.  Engineering or construction solutions can not be applied to mitigate the condition; and 
c.  Alternative access is not available from a street with a lower functional classification than the primary roadway.

Sec. 6.4. - Special treatments between zoning districts. 
    The following special treatments between zoning districts are to be construed as minimum standards and requirements. If other treatments are required, the standards and requirements that provide for the greatest separation and most buffering shall apply. 
    6.4.1. Perimeter landscaping relating to abutting properties, and buffers between residential and non-residential property. 
A.  All districts except in residential single-family districts, when all other areas are not exposed to adjacent public rights-of-way, shall be required to have a strip of land (or landscaped strip) at least five (5) feet in depth, which shall be landscaped, such landscaping to include one (1) tree for each forty-five (45) linear feet. The planting area shall be at least twenty-five (25) square feet with a dimension of at least five (5) feet. In addition, a continuous hedge of at least thirty (30) inches in height at the time of installation shall be placed along such perimeter landscaped strip. The remainder of the required landscaped area shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other landscape treatment, excluding pavement. 
B.  In commercial and industrial districts, there shall also be a requirement that when the perimeter property line is adjacent to a residential district, or separated from a residential district by a street, alley, canal or other open space, that any plot or parcel in such nonresidential district shall be buffered from said residential district by an eight (8) feet high masonry wall with a landscaped strip on both the inside and outside of the wall. The remainder of the required landscaping, for these landscaped strips, shall be as described in paragraph 6.4.1.A. above, except for depth of yard and landscaping strips under conditions contained in paragraph 6.4.1.C. below. Also, along the landscaped strip on the exterior of the wall, the hedge shall be thirty-six (36) inches in height at the time of installation. Maintenance shall be the responsibility of the property owner on both sides of the wall. 
1.  Adjustment. The Development Review Committee or the Planning and Zoning Board shall have the administrative authority to adjust on lots with frontage along Commercial Boulevard the requirement for a landscaped strip outside of the masonry wall and allow an eight (8) feet high masonry wall to be erected along the rear property line provided the following is demonstrated: 
a.  An easement runs parallel to and abutting the rear property line; and 
b.  If a canal right-of-way separates the lot from residential uses and the City Engineer concludes that any abutting canal right-of-way on the outside of the wall can accommodate some landscaping in addition to serving the purpose of the right-of-way, then the following shall apply: 
(1)  The site plan or site plan modification application provides for such number of trees or hedges or both installed, irrigated and maintained within the right-of-way such that the outside of the wall will be fifty (50) percent hidden from the abutting residential uses within three (3) years; and 
(2)  The site plan or site plan modification application provides for a minimum 10 feet deep landscaped strip on the inside of the wall, such strip to have a continuous hedge of at least thirty (30) inches in height at the time of installation along the wall and two offsetting rows of trees with one (1) tree for each forty-five (45) linear feet; and 
(3)  The site plan or site plan modification application provides for at least an equivalent number, size and quality of trees and hedges as is required under paragraph 6.4.1.A. above. 
The Development Review Committee or the Planning and Zoning Board may require an additional number of trees and hedges, taller trees and hedges at the time of installation, vines, and a deeper landscaped strip inside the wall as a buffer to mitigate impacts to the abutting residential uses. 
c.  If a canal right-of-way separates the lot from residential uses and the City Engineer concludes that any abutting canal right-of-way on the outside of the wall can not accommodate some landscaping or if a canal right-of-way does not separate the lot from residential uses, then the following shall apply: 
(1)  The site plan or site plan modification application provides for a minimum ten (10) feet deep landscaped strip on the inside of the wall, such strip to have a continuous hedge of at least thirty (30) inches in height at the time of installation along the wall and two offsetting rows of trees with one (1) tree for each forty-five (45) linear feet; and 
(2)  The site plan or site plan modification application provides for at least an equivalent number, size and quality of trees and hedges as is required under paragraph 6.4.1.A. above; and 
(3)  A voluntary monetary contribution is made to each abutting residential property owner at least equal to the cost of installing the required trees and hedges on the outside of the wall. 
The Development Review Committee or the Planning and Zoning Board may require an additional number of trees and hedges, taller trees and hedges at the time of installation, and a deeper landscaped strip inside the wall as a buffer to mitigate impacts to the abutting residential uses. In addition, a building permit shall not be issued until compliance with the voluntary monetary contribution is demonstrated. 
d.  An adjustment as described herein shall be the sole remedy for providing relief. A variance shall not be available. 
2.  Variance. Other than lots fronting on Commercial Boulevard, a variance development order shall be required to allow less than a five (5) feet deep landscaped strip outside of the masonry wall. 
C.  Where any district zoned business, commercial or industrial, is separated by a street from a residential district, then any plot in such a nonresidential district adjacent to the separating street shall be provided with an area at least twenty-five (25) feet in depth along such separating street. Such an area shall provide a landscape buffer at least ten (10) feet in depth along the separating street. In any district zoned commercial, such an area shall provide a landscape buffer at least fifteen (15) feet in depth. The landscape buffer shall meet the landscaping requirements for vehicular use areas or general open space, whichever is applicable in total or in part. Where the area is required, such an area, except for the required buffer, may be used for walkways, driveways, and landscaping, but not for any other purposes, as required by code. 
D.  Where any business district directly abuts on a residential district without any separator between them such as a street, alley, canal, or other public open space, then any plot in such a business district shall be provided with a yard at least fifteen (15) feet in depth adjacent to the residential district and such a yard shall be used exclusively for landscaping in conformance with this section. Where any commercial or industrial district directly abuts on a residential district without any separator between them such as a street, alley, canal, or other public open space, then any plot in such a commercial or industrial district shall be provided with a yard at least twenty (20) feet in depth adjacent to a residential district, and such yard shall be used exclusively for landscaping in conformance with this section. A wall shall also be required as described in [subsection] B. above. 
E.  When residential property abuts the Florida Turnpike right-of-way, hedges may reach fifteen (15) feet in height, but must be kept uniform in height and healthy in appearance. They shall not conflict with overhead power lines or any utility lines. 
    6.4.2. Perimeter buffer area amortization period. By December 31, 2018, all owners of commercial and industrial zoned properties that abut residential or open space park zoned properties shall have installed the required perimeter "buffer" area identified in Section 6.4.1. Where insufficient space exists to install the required landscaping and irrigation on both sides of the wall, a contribution equal to the cost of installing such landscaping and irrigation shall be made to the Tree Trust Fund or the abutting property owner or both. In the event a special exception development order has been granted requiring as a condition of approval the "buffer" area be installed before December 31, 2018, such condition shall be vacated. 
    6.4.3. Buffer area substitution. Owners of commercial and industrial properties may propose substitute buffer areas other than that required in subsection 6.4.1. Substitute buffer areas may include changes to the building materials, height, location, and landscaping and irrigation requirements. Owners shall submit an application and all other documents to establish that the Owner cannot comply with subsection 6.4.1. The City Manager, or his/her designee, can consider, among other things, a survey, underground or above ground utilities, setbacks. The Planning and Zoning Section is authorized to establish an application for the buffer substitution. If the City Manager, or his/her designee, denies the buffer substitution that decision is final. If the City Manager, or his/her designee, approves a buffer substitution, that recommendation shall be submitted in a report to the City Commission; a member of the City Commission then has seven (7) days to request that any matter for which a buffer substitution has been approved by the City Manager, or his/her designee, be added to the next available City Commission agenda to either uphold, modify, or deny the City Manager/designee's recommended approval for the buffer substitution. The City Manager, or his/her designee, shall consider the following factors in determining whether to allow a substituted buffer area, including the configuration of the buffer area and the time period for compliance: 
 Whether an easement is located along the commercial or industrial property line that would impede the ability of the owner to install a wall five (5) feet from the property line; and 
 Whether the driveway located between the building and the property line would be reduced from a two-way to a one-way driveway or a non-conforming one-way drive in order to accommodate the buffer area; and 
 Whether a water body is located between the commercial or industrial zoned property and the residential property, the width of the water body, and the slope of the bank; and 
 Whether an existing wall or landscaping or both are already in place, and the extent of the landscaping; and 
 Whether the impacts associated with the demolition of the wall or the removal of the landscaping or both exceeds the value of installing an eight-feet high wall and landscaping and the time it would take for the new landscaping to reach the height and fullness of the existing landscaping; and 
 The number of single-family residents that would be impacted by a substituted buffer area; and 
 The length of the buffer area and whether an additional period of time, not to exceed five (5) years, is reasonable in order to allow the property owner to install the buffer area.

E.  Where a building or use which existed on December 11, 1984, is changed in use or occupancy, additional off-street parking facilities shall be provided to the extent that the off-street parking required by this section for the new use or occupancy exceeds the off-street parking which would have been required for the previous use or occupancy had the regulations of this section been applicable thereto. For the purposes of this section, a change of use or occupancy shall mean a change from one category under paragraph 1.1.3. 
F.  It shall be unlawful for an owner or operator of any building, structure or use affected by this Code to discontinue, change or dispense with, or to cause the discontinuance or reduction of the required parking facilities apart from the discontinuance, sale, or transfer of such structure or use, without establishing alternative vehicle parking facilities which meet the requirements of this section. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to utilize such building, structure or use without providing the off-street parking facilities to meet the requirements of and be in compliance with this section. 
    6.5.2. Location and design standards: 
A.  The off-street parking facilities required by this section shall be located on the same plot or parcel of land they are intended to serve; provided, however, when practical difficulties, as determined by the City Commission, prevent the establishment of such facilities upon the same plot, the off-street parking facilities shall be provided on land which a abuts the premises they are to serve and are within seven hundred (700) feet of the premises they are to serve, and the owner of said parking area and the owner of the property to be served shall enter into written agreement with the City whereby the land providing the parking area shall never be sold or disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building the parking area serves so long as these parking facilities are required, and said agreement shall be recorded at the expense of the owner of the property on which the facilities will be located and shall run with the land to bind the heirs, successors and assigns of said owner. Said written agreement may be voided by the City Commission if other provisions are made for off-street parking facilities pursuant to this section. 
B.  Each parking space required and provided pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be less than nine (9) feet in width, and eighteen (18) feet in length, except for spaces utilized for parallel parking. The parallel parking space shall not be less than nine (9) feet in width and twenty-three (23) feet in length.

The required off-street parking facilities, including access aisles and driveways shall be surfaced with hard, durable, dustless material, and maintained in a smooth well graded condition. 
E.  All required parking spaces shall be directly accessible from a public or private street, alley or easement. All off-street parking areas shall be designed to permit convenient maneuvering of vehicles and each space shall be accessible without driving over or through any other parking space. Backout parking shall not be permitted on any street or highway designated on the Lauderhill Land Use Plan Map, except for parking spaces required for single-family dwellings. 
F.  All off-street parking facilities required by this Code shall be drained so as to retain run-off on site and not to cause any nuisance on adjacent or public property, and any lighting thereon shall be so arranged and designed as to prevent any glare or excessive light on adjacent property or public streets. Such facilities shall be arranged for convenient access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles. 
G.  A plan shall be submitted with every application for a building permit for any use or structure required to provide off-street parking under these regulations, which plan shall clearly and accurately designate the required parking spaces, access aisles and driveways, and relation to the uses or structures these off-street parking facilities are intended to serve. 
H.  In a Tree Preservation District, the Community Development Director may authorize up to twenty-five (25) percent of the required parking spaces to be designed for compact cares (nine (9) feet by sixteen (16) feet). Compact parking spaces must be clearly marked.

(1)  On the effective date of this chapter all LAPC's, NRA's, UWA's and ESL's which have been so designated by Broward County that occur within the City of Lauderhill shall be designated as a natural forest community. 
(2)  The designation of other real property as a natural forest community shall be made by the Commission following a public hearing. Before a site is designated as a natural forest community, the Commission shall make a finding that a natural forest community is at least two (2) acres in size, is generally comprised of a canopy, subcanopy and groundcover, and is populated by native vegetation associated with one (1) or more of the following communities: 
a.  Scrub community: An inland community that occurs on early level to sloping land. Soils are deep, acid, somewhat poorly to excessively drained and coarse textured. Trees found in such communities include sand pine, Chapman oak, sand live oak and myrtle oak. Shrubs include saw palmetto, scrub palmetto, gopher apple, prickly pear, shiny blueberry, staggerbush, fetterbush and palafoxia. Ground cover is scattered and large areas of light-colored sand are often noticeable; 
b.  Pine flatwoods community: This community is identified by flat topography and pine and palmetto vegetation with an understory of grasses and herbs. Trees found in such communities include slash pine and occasional oaks. Shrubs include saw palmetto, shiny blueberry, gallberry, tarflower and wax myrtle. Flatwood communities have a high water table during the rainy season; 
c.  High hammock community: This community develops slowly as organic materials accumulate creating a favorable land elevation. The presence of a high hammock indicates that the site has been undisturbed for a period of time. High hammocks are among the most diverse systems in South Florida containing more than one hundred (100) species of trees and shrubs. Characteristic tree species include live oak, pigeon plum, paradise tree, gumbo limbo, willow bustic, lancewood, mastic, strangler fig, satinleaf, mulberry, Simpson stopper. Shrubs include marlberry and wild coffee and such communities include a variety of ferns; 
d.  Low hammock community: Low hammocks are areas of dense forest vegetation dominated by tree species, such as laurel oak, strangler fig, cabbage palm, dahoon holly, scattered cypress trees and wax myrtle. Low hammocks develop on land that is of sufficient elevation to be seldom flooded, but in close proximity to water environments, and protected from fire. They frequently occur in transitional areas between drier upland communities and lowland vegetation types, such as marsh, wet prairie, cypress swamp or mangrove; 
e.  Cypress wetland community (freshwater swamp): Cypress wetlands occupy some portions of the freshwater lowlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Florida. Temperate deciduous trees dominate, and the areas are often seasonally flooded. Soils are nearly level or depressional, poorly drained and have a loamy top layer and sandy subsoils. Characteristic trees include bald cypress, red maple, cocoplum, dahoon holly, strangler fig and pond apple. Leather fern, royal fern and other fern species are found in cypress wetland communities; 
f.  Everglades community (freshwater marsh): The Everglades is a flat expanse of freshwater wetlands dominated by sawgrass and dotted with tree islands. The dominant plant species include sawgrass, coastal plain willow, wax myrtle, elderberry, cattail, spike-rush, pickerelweed, waterlily and periphyton. The vegetation found in the tree islands is determined by elevation, fire history and hydric factors, and varies from low willow heads to bay heads to tropical hardwood hammocks. 
(3)  The City Commission shall direct the City Manager to publish and mail or hand deliver a notice of public hearing to consider designation of a site as a natural forest community. Notice of hearing to be held by the Commission to consider designation of a site as a natural forest community shall be those required for a City Commission public hearing. In addition notice shall be mailed or hand delivered to the effected property owners at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing date. Such notice shall state time, date and place of the hearing, the location of the property under consideration, the ecological community or communities alleged to be included within the property, and the effect of the designation on lands classified as natural forest communities. For purposes of this notification, an owner of property shall be deemed to be the person who is shown as the owner on the tax rolls of the Broward County Property Appraiser unless the City has actual notice that a person or entity other than the person or entity shown on the tax roll is the owner. 
(4)  Following designation of a natural forest community, notification of such designation shall be sent to the property owner(s). In addition a map depicting sites designated as natural forest communities shall be maintained at the City for viewing by the public.

(3)  Areas which contain relatively undisturbed canopy and/or have good stratification of cover (e.g. canopy, subcanopy, ground cover) shall be identified and preserved. 
(4)  Utility line installations shall not be located in preservation areas. 
(5)  Resource management plan. Any proposed development activity which would negatively impact the natural forest community must be mitigated through a resource management plan, approved by the City, which significantly improves the viability of the remainder of the resource. No tree removal permit shall be issued until an agreement providing for the implementation of the resource management plan has been executed and recorded, and any covenants, easements or physical improvements required by the plan are in place. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for developments that include natural forest communities unless it is determined that the applicable provisions of the resource management plan have been met. 
(6)  Conservation easement. As a condition of an issuance of a permit under this sub-category where preservation is required, a conservation easement shall be granted by the applicant to the City and the citizens of the City. The conservation easement shall: 
a.  Be duly executed and recorded and placed on the face of the plat; 
b.  Meet the approval of the City Attorney; 
c.  Prohibit land clearing, development or other harmful activity on the preserved portion of the natural forested community;

Sec. 6.9. - Lighting standards, requirements, and conservation. 
    6.9.1. Residential. All parking lots solely for residential uses shall be provided with a minimum of 0.5 FC (one-half footcandle) of light on the parking and walking surface from dusk to dawn. A maximum to minimum footcandle level shall not exceed a ratio of twelve to one (12:1). The lighting system shall be designed, installed and maintained as not to create spill lighting or glare onto any adjacent property not a part of the site, or other area of the site not intended to be illuminated, including minimizing light emission above the horizontal plane. Parking lot lighting must be reflected on a site plan. 
    6.9.2. Nonresidential. All parking lots for nonresidential uses or a combination of nonresidential and residential uses, shall be provided with a minimum of 0.5 FC (one-half footcandle) of light on the parking and walking surface from dusk until thirty (30) minutes after the termination of business each business day. A maximum to minimum footcandle level shall not exceed a ratio of twelve to one (12:1). The lighting system shall be designed, installed and maintained as not to create spill lighting or glare onto any adjacent property not a part of the plan [site], or other area of the site not intended to be illuminated, including minimizing light emission above the horizontal plane. 
    6.9.3. Definition[s]. 
A.  Light emission above the horizontal plane: The protruding of light above the source of the light. 
B.  Glare: The sensation produced by a luminance within the visual field that are sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes are adapted to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility. The magnitude of the sensation of glare depends upon such factors as the size, position, and luminance of a source, the number of sources and the luminance to which the eyes are adapted. Glare can result in blinding glare, direct glare, disability glare and discomfort glare. 
    6.9.4. Lighting conservation. In order to reduce energy consumption, and reduce light pollution, the City of Lauderhill requires, as part of a review of any development within the City, the following requirements: 
A.  Lighting systems shall reduce energy consumption to the maximum extent possible and shall satisfactorily illuminate the designated area as intended for safety and necessary visibility in order to provide the intended lighting of the premises. The City of Lauderhill may also require limitations as to the hours that particular lighting materials may be used if it is determined to be unnecessary for safety and necessary visibility, and the use of automatic timing devices to restrict the hours of illumination. Outdoor lighting shall utilize flat lens fixtures with an IES classification of full cut-off to minimize impacts from light pollution, including light trespass, glare and urban sky glow to preserve enjoyment of the night sky and minimize conflict caused by unnecessary illumination. Floodlighting through the use of any up light will not be permitted. 
B.  Landscaping shall not be installed or maintained to the extent that it restricts light from reaching those areas it is intended to illuminate. 
C.  A maximum of fifty (50) percent of the exterior surface of any building or structure may be comprised of reflective material that has a light reflectivity factor greater than thirty (30) percent. 
D.  Reflective materials shall not be permitted where the Chief Building Official, Development Review Committee or Planning and Zoning Board determines that their use would contribute to light pollution, potential traffic hazards, diminished quality of riparian habitat, reduce enjoyment of public open space, or intensifies the concentration of heat in a particular area. 
E.  Lighting systems shall be directed or shielded or both so that light does not create light pollution within public rights-of-way or surrounding properties. Light trespass shall be no greater than 0.5 FC (one-half footcandle) at the property line measured at grade. 
F.  All outdoor exterior lighting fixtures must comply with EnergyStar certification requirements for Solid State Lighting Luminaires in force at the time of submittal for review.

Sec. 6.10. - Crime prevention through environmental design. 
(Ord. No. 02R-10-172, § 10, 11-25-02) 
Sec. 6.11. - Paint standards and requirements. 
    6.11.1. Painting and Maintenance Required. Within a residential zoning district, all building exterior wall surfaces, including detached garage, other walled structures, perimeter walls and fences, shall be painted, shall be kept free of faded or chipped paint, and shall be maintained in good repair and good condition to prevent deterioration, and shall be repainted, recovered, or cleaned when twenty-five (25) percent or more of any exposed surface becomes discolored or is peeling. This subsection shall not apply to chain link fences. 
    6.11.2. Subject to Maintenance Association. Where, on the adoption date of this section, a building, structure, wall or fence or any combination of the above are subject to an existing Homeowner's, Condominium, or Maintenance Association with a recorded Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions, Declaration of Condominiums or other similar document that specifies the exterior color of buildings, structures, walls and fences, the exterior of such building, structure, wall and fence shall be painted consistent with the colors specified in such documents. 
    6.11.3. Not Subject to a Homeowners, Condominium or Maintenance Association. Where, on the adoption date of this section, a building, structure, wall or fence or any combination of the above are not subject to a Homeowner's, Condominium, or Maintenance Association with an existing recorded Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions, Declaration of Condominiums or similar document that specifies the exterior color of such building, structure, walls and fences, the following additional standards and requirements shall apply. 
A.  Three (3) colors allowed. A residential building, structure, wall and fence exterior colors shall not exceed three (3), consisting of one (1) base color and not more than two (2) trim or accent colors for such areas as fascia boards, doors, door casings, window casings, shutters, columns, coining (corner treatments), and architectural relief. Perimeter walls, fences and other structures on the property shall be painted the same colors as the building, with the main body of the wall, fence or structure the same as the building, and any structure, wall or fence trim the same trim as the building. Stone and brick exteriors may be left unpainted and shall not be considered as one (1) of the three (3) colors. 
B.  Color palette. All colors shall be selected from the palette approved by resolution of the City Commission, upon a recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Board. 
C.  Permit required. In order to ensure compliance with these provisions, before a residential building, structure, wall or fence is painted, a paint permit shall be obtained from the City. The Zoning Inspector shall not issue a paint permit unless the color of the building, structure, wall and fence is consistent with the approved color palette. A permit fee shall not be imposed for this permit. A paint permit shall not be required to repaint a building, structure, wall or fence the same color as it is currently, provided such building, structure, wall or fence is in compliance with the color palette. Moreover, a paint permit shall not be required when the color white is the base color. 
D.  Relief. If the Zoning Inspector denies a paint permit, the permitee may seek relief by filing, with and on forms provided by the Planning and Zoning Department, either for discretionary relief or for an appeal. 
1.  Discretionary relief. If a person desires to paint their residential building, structure, wall or fence a color other that authorized in paragraph 6.11.3.B. above, a person may file for discretionary relief. Discretionary relief requires the permitee obtain from all property owners abutting the subject property or within a three hundred (300) feet radius of the subject property, whichever is greater, a signed, written statement expressing their approval or consent for the paint colors filed with the paint permit. An abutting property includes the property on either side of the subject property, the properties directly across any dedicated right-of-way from the subject property, and the properties on either side of the properties directly across any dedicated right-of-way. The Zoning Inspector shall deny the discretionary relief if the permitee fails to obtain all the required signatures of all such property owners. If all such signatures are obtained and verified, the Zoning Inspector may reconsider the previous denial and grant the permit, provided the Zoning Inspector concludes the colors are compatible with other colors in the neighborhood. 
2.  Appeal. If a person believes the Zoning Inspector has erroneously denied a paint permit, the homeowner or lessee may appeal such decision to a panel comprised of the Planning and Zoning Director, the City Manager and the Chief Building Official, or their designated staff representative. The panel may confirm or overrule the decision of the Zoning Inspector. 
    6.11.4. Gateway Road Walls and Fences. Walls and fences along gateway roads designated elsewhere in these Land Development Regulations shall be painted uniformly. 
    6.11.5. Roof Surfaces. Roof surfaces are not subject to these regulations unless the roofing material is to be painted or repainted. Roof surfaces comprised of shingles, tile or aggregate material with a factory-installed color finish are not subject to these regulations. In the event that a roof surface is to be painted or repainted, only one (1) color shall be allowed, and such color used must match a color used on the building. 
    6.11.6. Windows. Window frames and muntins are not subject to these regulations unless the window frame and muntin is to be painted or repainted. Window frames and muntins with a factory-installed color finish are not subject to these regulations. In the event that a window frame or muntin is to be painted or repainted, only one (1) color shall be allowed, and such color used must match a color used on the building. 
    6.11.7. Enforcement and Penalties. The owner of any residential building, structure, wall or fence that is not in compliance with the above-described provisions shall be in violation of these Land Development Regulations. A Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a citation for such violation and, upon conviction, the owner shall be subject to a fine as provided in Part II., Chapter 1, General Provisions, Section 1-8 of the Code of Ordinances. Further, this penalty provision is in addition to such other remedies as may be provided by law or ordinance. 
    6.11.8. Amortization Compliance Date. The owner of residential property affected by these regulations shall bring their buildings, structures, walls and fences into compliance with these regulations by January 1, 2007. If the owner of the residential property can demonstrate extenuating circumstances or a hardship to the satisfaction of the Zoning Inspector as to why the property cannot be brought into compliance by January 1, 2007, then the Zoning Inspector may grant the owner an extension of up to two (2) years within which to come into compliance. If the owner believes the Zoning Inspector has erroneously denied an extension of time, the owner may appeal such decision to a panel comprised of the Planning and Zoning Director, the City Manager and the Chief Building Official, or their designated staff representative. The panel may confirm or overrule the decision of the Zoning Inspector.

    1.3.1. Pre-application conference. Prior to filing any development order application, the applicant or petitioner shall attend a mandatory Pre-Application Conference with the Planning and Zoning Division staff and appropriate Development Review Committee representatives to discuss the development review process, including the type of review required (major or minor), the time frames for development order application review, the extent to which review can be expedited, and the extent to which the design standards and guidelines apply. If expedited review is requested, then a timeline shall be prepared and executed among the parties to ensure review proceeds as planned. If the applicant or petitioner fails to meet a scheduled deadline, then the Department shall contact the owner and advise that the application will be postponed until the next regularly scheduled meeting at the earliest and a new timeline shall be prepared and executed by the parties. No person may rely upon any comment concerning a proposed development plan, or any expression of any nature about the proposal made by any participant at the pre-application conference as a representation or implication that the proposal will be ultimately approved or rejected in any form. 
    1.3.2. Completeness of application. The Planning and Redevelopment Department shall review the application for development to determine its completeness. Within five (5) working days after receipt, Department staff shall either accept the application if it is complete, or reject the application if it is incomplete and forward to the applicant a notice of incompleteness specifying the data missing from the application received. The determination of completeness in this subsection shall include the submission requirements set forth in Article III and Article IV. The failure of the applicant or petitioner to attend the mandatory Pre-Application Conference prior to filing the application shall cause the development order application to be incomplete. 
A.  If a notice indicating the application is not complete is not sent to the applicant, the application shall be deemed accepted for purposes of processing. 
B.  If a notice indicating the application is not complete is sent to the applicant, the applicant may resubmit the application with the additional data required, in which event Department staff shall review the resubmitted application in the manner provided in this subsection for the original application. 
    An applicant may amend a development order or permit application after it has been accepted. Department staff shall examine the amendment at the point in the reviewing process at which it occurs to determine if any portion of the reviewing process must be repeated. If any such portion must be repeated, Department staff is authorized to extend the time limits prescribed in this section as long as necessary to undertake such additional review, but not to exceed forty-five (45) calendar days from the date that the amendment is received. 
    1.3.3. Agency review. Upon acceptance of development order application, Planning and Redevelopment Department staff shall forward a copy of the application and accompanying material to each of the following agencies for review, as applicable. 
A.  The City agency responsible for engineering. 
B.  Any affected utility companies. 
C.  The Broward County agency responsible for public transportation. 
D.  The City agency responsible for parks and recreation. 
E.  The City agencies responsible for public safety. 
F.  Any other agency designated by Department staff. 
    1.3.4. Review responsibilities. The applicable reviewing City agencies shall timely submit their comments and recommendations regarding the development order. 
A.  Department staff may waive agency review, in whole or in part, under this Section upon a determination that such a review has already been made regarding the same land and no change in circumstances has occurred which necessitates further review. 
B.  Agency review responsibilities under this section may be reassigned by the Planning and Redevelopment Director, from time-to-time, as necessary to more effectively perform the required reviews. 
C.  If the application is subject to administrative review and Department staff believes there is a substantial question regarding the proposed development, Department staff shall refer the matter to the Planning and Redevelopment Director, who may determine the application should be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Board for a final determination. 
    1.3.5. Processing and notice. 
A.  Processing times. Within forty-five (45) calendar days from the acceptance of a development order application (unless revised pursuant to Subsection 1.3.2.), the Planning and Zoning Director shall compile the individual staff reports and cause to be prepared a written Development Review Report with proposed findings, conclusions and a recommendation. Notwithstanding the above, should a development order application be filed causing the total number of applications on file with the Planning and Zoning Division to exceed four (4) applications, then the Director may extend the internal processing time by five (5) calendar days for each application. 
B.  Notice of hearing. Within the time frames specified above, the Planning and Zoning Director shall provide to the applicant by written or electronic mail the written copy of the Development Review Report and a Notice of Public Hearing. The Notice of Public Hearing shall identify the time, date, location and the intermediate official or collegial body that shall make a recommendation of the application pursuant to Subsection 1.3.6. or the official and collegial body that shall make a final determination on the application consistent with Subsection 1.3.8. The public hearing shall be held no sooner than ten (10) calendar days or no more than thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration of the above described time frames unless such hearing date would fall within a holiday or recess, in which case the application shall be placed on the next available public hearing date. Notwithstanding the above, the applicant may request the public hearing be continued. 
    1.3.6. Required action by intermediate official or collegial body. In the event that these regulations require that a development order or permit not be approved until acted upon by some other intermediate official or collegial body then Department staff shall forward the development review report on the application to such intermediate official or collegial body consistent with the time frames specified in LDR Article IV., Subsection 1.3.5. and shall make a recommendation to the decision-making official or collegial body concerning the final determination required by and consistent with Subsection 1.3.8. Within thirty (30) days after a recommendation is made by the intermediate official or collegial body, the development order application shall be place on a public hearing agenda for a final determination consistent with Subsection 1.3.8. unless such hearing date would fall within a holiday or recess, in which case the application shall be placed on the next available public hearing date. 
    1.3.7. Withdrawal of applications. A development order application may be withdrawn at any time so long as no notice has been given that the application will be reviewed at a public hearing. If notice has been given, the application may be withdrawn, but only after all appropriate fees have been paid. 
    1.3.8. Final determination. At a regularly scheduled public meeting or hearing and consistent with the time periods herein, any official or collegial body authorized to act upon a development order application shall make one (1) of the following final determinations: 
A.  That the application is in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of these regulations or that vested rights exist with regard to any noncompliance, in which case the applicable official or collegial body shall adopt a development order granting approval of the application; 
B.  That the application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of these regulations, in which case the applicable official or collegial body shall adopt a development order denying the application with or without prejudice to re-submit an application; or 
C.  That the application is not in compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of these regulations but conditions have been determined by the applicable official or collegial body to be reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the applicable standards and minimum requirements of these regulations, and that vested rights exist with regard to any noncompliance, in which case the applicable official or collegial body shall adopt a development order granting approval of the application with said conditions; or 
D.  That the application be tabled because it does not contain sufficient information upon which to make a final determination. If this alternative is selected, the official or collegial body shall identify with particularity the information needed in order to make a final determination on an application and shall specify a specific date when the application will be reconsideration for a final determination. If the application is site specific, a final determination shall be made within forty-five (45) days unless such hearing date would fall within a holiday or recess, in which case the application shall be placed on the next available public hearing date. A final determination for all other applications shall be made within one (1) year. 
    1.3.9. Effect of development order. 
A.  No development permit shall be issued except pursuant to an effective development order. 
B.  No development permit shall be issued for a development which is inconsistent with the development order governing such development. 
    1.3.10. Conditional or erroneous issuance of development permit and certificates of occupancy; interpretations and representation. 
A.  Any permit or certificate of occupancy which is issued prior to the completion of all the requirements of the permit or certificate of occupancy, including state laws, South Florida Building Code, applicable federal law or these regulations, shall be issued conditionally. All such requirements shall be met within a time period to be determined by the Director of Community Development. If these requirements shall not be met, the permit or certificate of occupancy shall be revoked. If the permit or certificate of occupancy shall be revoked, the status of the affected property shall be the same as if the permit or certificate of occupancy had never been issued and all occupational licenses or other licenses which may have been issued with regard to the property shall also be revoked. The fact that the property may be occupied by a tenant or tenants who may be adversely affected shall in no way nullify the terms of this section. The property shall be restored to its original condition. 
B.  Approval of permit applications by the Community Development Department shall not preempt applicable regulations, codes and laws. A building permit issued in error shall not confer any rights or privileges to the applicant to proceed with the building permitted thereunder, and shall be null and void. 
C.  No person shall be entitled to rely upon any alleged verbal comment on these Land Development Regulations and any land development activity as a representation, commitment or implication which obligates the City in any way. All land use related obligations, representations or commitments must meet the following standards for it to be binding: 
1.  A written document printed on City letterhead and signed by the City Official with subject matter jurisdiction or authorized to make such a determination as specified in these Land Development Regulations; and 
2.

The City of Lauderhill recognizes that certain property owners or developers may have a claim to a vested right based upon agreements with the City of Lauderhill entered into prior to December 1, 1989, the adoption date of the City of Lauderhill Comprehensive Plan. The City recognizes that such rights would arise in a circumstance where: 
A.  All regional roads. 
1.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake or fund a road improvement which exceeded the developer's obligation under any plat approval; and

B.  Specific road segment. 
1.  The agreement provided for the developer to undertake a road improvement which is unrelated to plat approval; and 
2.  The developer did not receive payment or credit for such improvement since it was determined that the road would be required to provide safe and adequate access to the unplatted property; and 
3.  The developer constructed the road to service his development without any compensation; and 
4.  In such circumstances the vested trips on the road segment constructed by the developer shall not exceed the lesser of: the number of trips the road improvement can accommodate at Level of Service D or the number of trips generated on the segment by the intensity or density of development specified in the agreement. 
1.6.2.  Entitlement to impact fee credits pursuant to an agreement shall not, of itself, constitute a basis for total vesting of development rights. 
1.6.3.  It is recognized that there may be additional circumstances where some vested rights have arisen which are not specified in Section A. 
1.6.4.  Procedure for claiming vested rights. 
A.  Any property owner or developer may seek a vested rights determination regarding a specific unplatted or platted parcel for which additional intensity or density is sought. 
B.  Requests for vested rights determination shall be made on forms provided by the Community Development Department.

C.  After the developer has submitted a complete application for a vested rights determination; the Community Development Department shall provide a written report with findings and recommendations. The application and Community Development Department's report shall be forwarded to the City Attorney's office for review and recommendations. 
D.  The City Commission shall conduct an administrative hearing regarding the vested rights determination. The procedures for conducting hearings shall be approved by a resolution of the City Commission. The hearing shall be set for no later than sixty (60) days from the date of application unless an extension of time is requested or agreed to by the applicant or the City, and may be heard at a regular or special meeting of the City Commission. 
E.  The City Commission shall determine whether vested rights have been created pursuant to clear evidence that vested rights claimed by the developer or property owners exist, and shall determine whether any time limitation is applicable to such vested rights. 
F.  If vested rights are stipulated to or found by the City Commission concerning local roads, water, sewer, recreation or other public facilities impact, such vested rights shall be placed within the concurrency system and shall be available to the benefitted property indefinitely or for whatever time limitation is found to exist. 
G.  A determination by the City Commission that vested rights have not arisen shall be determined to be a final decision of the City. 
H.  Any appeal shall be by writ of certiorari to the Broward Circuit Court within thirty (30) days of the final decision of the City.

The City Manager may grant, in writing, two (2) extensions of eighteen (18) months each for good cause. Thereafter, the applicant must reapply for a new conceptual master development plan. The City Manager may deny an extension due to any changes of the land development regulations or comprehensive plan, adopted since the conceptual master development plan approval that renders such plan inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan or Land Development Regulations or incompatible with the surrounding land uses. 
1.10.6.  Other requirements. The requirements of Subsection 1.11.7 on timing of improvements and required bonds shall apply; however, such improvements may be made by phase as opposed to the entire development project.

The required perimeter landscaping, swales, entrance features, entry drive landscaping and sidewalks, internal collector drive(s), pedestrian walkways, walls, and all appurtenant hardscape features, including, but not limited to, fountains, roundabouts, and benches (the "improvements") shall be installed for the entire project area shown on the master development plan prior to the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy, developers shall provide bonds in an amount equal to one hundred thirty-three (133) percent of the cost of the improvements, and providing for and securing the actual and timely construction and installation of the approved improvements, in compliance with each of the following requirements: 
a.  Bonds allowed, required construction plans, hold harmless agreement. Bonds, as that term is used in this section, shall include letters of credit, certificates of deposit, cash bonds, bonds issued by an insurance company legally doing business in the State of Florida, or other acceptable means agreeable to the city attorney.

d.  Extension of bond periods. Developers may obtain a one-year extension of a bond (and a related one-year deferral of the completion date of the improvements) upon submission and city approval of an updated cost estimate. If the updated cost estimate is greater than the original cost estimate, then the amount of the bond shall be increased proportionately so that the bond still guarantees one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the approved cost estimate. A developer may seek no more than one (1) extension to the original, one-year bond period. 
e.  Violations.

The landscaping shall be located in the area on either side of the entry drive and shall extend along the right-of-way one (1) each side of the entry drive a distance equal to one-half (1/2) the width of the right-of-way to which the entry drive connects. The landscaping shall extend along the entry drive to the first parking space or the first intersecting internal drive. Notwithstanding the above, the minimum required distance parallel and perpendicular to the entry feature landscaping for secondary entries shall be one-half (1/2) the minimum extent for primary entries. Secondary entries shall be defined as those entries used primarily for service access to, or from, the site. Entrance features shall include elegantly distinctive architectural design, identifying and distinguishing the project. The department may, at its discretion, adopt and, from time to time, modify administrative rules to provide additional details to govern the design and construction of landscaping and architectural features.

d.  [Architectural features.] Decorative pavers, or stamped architectural concrete shall be required to be placed on roadways at project entryways, the intersections of internal circulation drives, any roundabouts with architectural features in the center, and for all driveways to any parking garage. 
e.  [Site feature criteria.] Site features of subdivided parcels within a master planned site shall be subject to the approved master plan design criteria. Site plans shall be designed to complement the approved master plan. The exterior colors of buildings, trim and other site features shall be subject to the approval of the department. They shall be selected to ensure compatibility among the various colors of the approved master plan a visually tranquil environment, and they shall conform to the requirements of Schedule P, Design Guidelines. 
f.  [Fountain requirements.] Lakes and other detention areas shall be equipped with fountains for aeration and decoration. Fountain spray shall be lighted and the spray height shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet, but not less than twenty-five (25) percent of the shortest dimension of the lake or other detention area. Maximum spray height shall be limited to fifty (50) feet. 
g.  Internal collector drive median landscaping. For all required internal collector drive medians within all districts, the following landscaping shall be required as a minimum: One (1) tree or palm per each twenty-five (25) lineal feet of median or fraction thereof, and a combination of low- and mid-level landscaping that encompasses a minimum of fifty (50) percent of the median area. Species shall be specimen trees or palms selected from City's approved plant list, with a minimum height for trees of twenty (20) feet and for palms of twenty-five (25) feet. Trees or palms shall be installed within the median and both sides of the internal collector drive. 
h.  Recreational amenities. Any recreational facilities to serve the project, in the case of residential uses, shall be completed and receive a certificate of occupancy before the certificate of occupancy for the first residential unit will be approved. 
i.  Changes to master development plans. Master development plans are adopted as an integrated and unified program of development for a particular property that is compatible with the surrounding development. Any change in use to a portion of the master development plan is disfavored and shall not be approved unless the developer seeking a change demonstrates to the commission by clear and convincing evidence that there has been a material change in circumstances that requires the change, that the change is the minimum necessary and that the amended master development plan will result in development of at least the same quality and compatibility as would the originally approved master development plan. Financing issues shall not be considered a material change in circumstances.

LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS [3] 
Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 04O-04-125, § 1, adopted May 10, 2004, amended Art. IV, Part 3.0 title to read as herein set out. Former title pertained to variances. 

Sec. 3.1. - Variances. 
    A variance is a relaxation of the terms of these Land Development Regulations where such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where owing to the conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of actions of the landowner, a literal enforcement of the regulations would result in unnecessary and undue hardship. 
3.1.1.  Variances shall be by ordinance. All variances from the terms of these regulations or the Code shall be by ordinance. 
3.1.2.  [Notifications.] The public notice requirements described in Article IV., Development Review Requirements, Part 1.0., General application filing, review and final determination, Section 1.9 are applicable. 
3.1.3.  Requirements for variances. No variance from the terms of these regulations or the Code shall be authorized by the board of adjustment unless the board finds that all of the following facts and conditions exist: 
A.  That there are unique and special circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question, or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties in the same district. The matter of economic hardship shall not constitute a basis for the granting of a variance. 
B.  That any alleged hardship is not self-created by any person having an interest in the property nor is the result of mere disregard for or ignorance of the provisions of these regulations or any pertinent Code section. 
C.  That strict application of the provisions of these regulations or any pertinent Code section would deprive the property owner of reasonable use of the property for which the variance is sought. 
D.  That the variance proposed is the minimum variance that makes possible the reasonable use of the property. 
E.  That granting the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of existing regulations, will not be injurious to the neighborhood or area, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
3.1.4.  Conditions and limitations. 
A.  In authorizing any variance from the terms of these regulations or any pertinent Code section, the Board of Adjustment shall include, as part of such variance, any conditions, requirements or limitations which the board may believe to be necessary and desirable to protect adjacent properties and the surrounding neighborhood, to carry out the spirit and purpose of these regulations or any pertinent Code section, and to provide for the health, safety or welfare of the City and its residents. 
B.  Any variance which is not instituted, operated and maintained in full conformity with the terms and conditions of the board's approval and the provisions of the Land Development Regulations is hereby declared to be an illegal use in violation of the zoning district regulations and shall be discontinued and removed forthwith. 
3.1.5.  Time limit. Any variance authorized by the Board of Adjustment which requires a development permit shall expire one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of final action on such variance by the Board of Adjustment, unless a/the development permit, based upon and incorporating the variance, is issued within the aforesaid one hundred eighty-day period. The Community Development Director may extend this expiration time period without further action of the Board of Adjustment. 
3.1.6.  Votes required for approval for all variances. Approval of any variance application shall require four (4) votes by the Board of Adjustment. In the event that there shall be a quorum of fewer than four (4) Board members, approval must then be unanimous. 
(Ord. No. 01O-04-25, § 1, 4-30-01; Ord. No. 04O-04-125, §§ 1-8, 5-10-04; Ord. No. 09O-07-130, § 6, 8-31-09; Ord. No. 15O-03-106, § 4, 4-13-2015) 
Sec. 3.2. - Waivers. 
    A waiver involves the granting of total relief from a specific development regulation. 
3.2.1.  Rule. 
A.  General. A waiver may be granted to the procedural and substantive provisions of these regulations. A waiver may be granted only for those substantive items within these regulations for which such provision is made. A waiver to substantive provisions may be granted only by the Board or body that has the authority to approve or deny the related development application. 
B.  Special power of the City Commission. Notwithstanding, the City Commission may grant a waiver to any provision of these regulations when there is no other avenue for relief available in these regulations. Waivers shall not be considered with respect to: 
1.  Matters which pertain to the use of land or structures; 
2.  A requirement for a public hearing or providing notice that an item will be considered by a development board; 
3.  The regulation for which it is stated that there shall not be any variance or waiver granted. 
3.2.2.  Required information. Any person requesting a waiver from the Land Development Regulations shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Department a written letter stating the following: 
A.  The specific citation or reference of the Land Development Regulation to be waived; and 
B.  The justification for granting the waiver. 
3.2.3.  Procedure. A request for waiver may be considered concurrently with the development application with which it is associated. If a waiver request is made after review by an advisory board has been completed, the waiver must first be reviewed by the advisory body prior to action by the approving body. 
3.2.4.  Conditions. Conditions may be imposed upon the granting of a waiver to the extent that the conditions are directly related to mitigating any adversity which may be created by the waiver of a specific Land Development Regulation. 
3.2.5.  Findings and conclusions. A waiver shall not be granted unless findings and conclusions to support the following factors exists: 
A.  The waiver does not adversely affect the neighboring area; 
B.  The waiver does not significantly diminish the provision of public facilities; 
C.  The waiver does not create an unsafe situation; and 
D.  The waiver does not result in the grant of a special privilege in that the same waiver would be granted under similar circumstances on other property for another applicant or owner. 
(Ord. No. 04O-04-126, §§ 1-6, 5-10-04) 
Sec. 3.3. - Adjustments. 
    An adjustment involves the lessening, or a total waiver, of those development standards which affect the spatial relationship among improvements on the land. 
3.3.1.  Rule. An adjustment only shall be considered during the site plan or site plan modification review process and shall be for requirements that do not pertain to, or affect, standards that apply to the perimeter of an overall development proposal. The Planning and Zoning Board may grant the adjustment to a site plan and the Development Review Committee may grant the adjustment to a site plan modification. 
3.3.2.  Required information. Any person requesting an adjustment from the Land Development Regulations shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Department a written letter stating the following: 
A.  The specific citation or reference of the Land Development Regulation to be waived; and 
B.  The justification for granting the waiver. 
3.3.3.  Procedure. A request for adjustment may be considered concurrently with the development application with which it is associated. If an adjustment request is made after review by an advisory body has been completed, the adjustment must first be reviewed by the advisory body prior to action by the approving body. 
3.3.4.  Conditions. Conditions are not appropriate to the granting of an adjustment because the basis for granting the adjustment is that it provides a superior product than if the project were to strictly comply with the letters of the Land Development Regulations. 
3.3.5.  Findings and conclusions. An adjustment shall not be granted unless findings and conclusion to support the following factors exists: 
A.  The adjustment does not diminish the practical application of the affected Land Development Regulation; and 
B.  The adjustment will result in a superior development as compared to the development allowed under the affected Land Development Regulation. 
(Ord. No. 04O-04-127, §§ 1-6, 5-10-04) 
Sec. 3.4. - Administrative relief. 
    Administrative relief is the method whereby relief is granted from development regulations by an administrative official. 
3.4.1.  Rule. Administrative relief can be granted only for those instances in which it is specifically allowed. The Planning and Zoning Director is the only administrative official who is empowered to grant administrative relief. 
3.4.2.  Required information. Any person requesting administrative relief from the Land Development Regulations shall submit to the Planning and Zoning Department a written letter stating the following: 
A.  The specific citation or reference of the Land Development Regulation for which administrative relief is requested; and

3.4.3.  Procedure. 
A.  With site plan or site plan modification review. A request for relief shall be considered concurrently with the development order or permit application with which it is associated and shall be acted upon by the Director prior to the consideration of the site plan or site plan modification. If the request for relief is denied, it may be considered again when the site plan or site plan modification is acted upon.

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 01O-04-22, § 1, adopted April 30, 2001, added Art. IV, Part 7.0 title. 

Sec. 7.1. - Consistency and concurrency determination standards. 
    Consistency with City Comprehensive Plan. 
(a)  Generally. No development activity may be approved unless it is found that the development is consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan and that the provision of certain public facilities will be available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development on those facilities. 
(b)  Determining consistency with City Comprehensive Plan. If a development proposal is found to meet all the requirements of the City Land Development Regulations it shall be presumed to be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan in all respects except for compliance with the concurrency requirement. The Land Development Regulations shall be amended from time-to-time to implement the effective Comprehensive Plan. The City Planner, other public official or any citizen may, however, question the consistency of a development proposal with the Comprehensive Plan. If a question of consistency is raised, the Director of Community Development shall conduct a technical evaluation and make a determination of consistency or inconsistency and support that determination with written findings. An appeal of the determination to the City Commission may be made by filing a written appeal with the Director of Community Development within thirty (30) days of the determination. An appeal after the City Commission determination shall be to the Circuit Court of Broward County, Florida. 
(c)  Development subject to adequacy determination for levels of service. 
(1)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously vacant land except that specified in Subsection (3) below, shall be subject to adequacy determination unless a site plan has been approved prior to December 1, 1989 and development activity has occurred within the plat or replat area. 
(2)  For plats or replats, or for site plans or building permits in the City of Lauderhill where the property is unplatted or was platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979, all development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional capacity that equal the difference between the capacity to be generated or consumed by the development specified in the proposed note on the plat and the capacity generated or consumed by the existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than eighteen (18) months previous to the date the final plat is submitted, or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
(3)  For a replat, or an amendment to a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall be required for those additional capacities that equal the difference between the previous plat and the replat; or the previous note in the proposed amendment to the note; or the development approved by the County Commission at the time of plat approval and the proposed note to be placed on the plat. 
(4)  All plats approved after October 1, 1989 by the Broward County Commission and all developments (i.e., site plans) approved after the date of this Ordinance by the City of Lauderhill must undergo adequacy determinations of concurrency. 
(d)  Measurement of capacities. 
(1)  Water and wastewater. Measurement of water and wastewater facilities will be based on design capacities and service flows. Usage and discharge will be based on adopted level of service standards. These levels may be amended after consideration and substantiation of engineering studies and/or an amendment to the City of Lauderhill Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  Roadways. The procedure for the initial measuring of highway capacities is the Florida DOT Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes made available to local government for use from January 1989 through December 1990. Future capacities standards will be issued by FDOT as necessary. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data. Traffic analysis techniques must be technically sound and justifiable as determined by the Broward County Office of Planning and City Engineer. Alterations to capacity on the State Highway Network shall require FDOT review. Measurement of County and State roads shall be in accordance with the development review requirements of the Broward County Land Development facilities in a specific area if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(Ord. No. 01O-10-61, § 1, 11-26-01) 
Editor's note- Formerly § 4.1. 
Sec. 7.2. - Determination of available capacity. 
(a)  For purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
a.  Adding together: 
1.  The total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
2.  The total design capacity of new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one (1) or more of the following is shown: 
(a)  The necessary facilities are in place at the time a plat approval issued, or a plat approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur. 
(b)  Construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of application. 
(c)  The new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract or the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued. 
(d)  The new facilities have been included in the City capital improvement program annual budget. 
(e)  The new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement. Such facilities must be consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of the City Comprehensive Plan and approved by the City Engineer. 
(f)  The developer has contributed funds to the City or County necessary to provide new facilities consistent with the Capital Improvements Element of the City Comprehensive Plan. Commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by the City or other governmental entity. 
(g)  The proposed development does not place any trips on the over capacity roadway link. 
(h)  There is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development. 
(i)  The subject area has been determined to be a special transportation area (STA) relating to roadway concurrency issues. 
(j)  The development is authorized by an approved Development of Regional Impact (DRI) Development Order. 
(k)  The proposed development is found to have vested rights with regard to any effected roadway segments or infrastructure capacity reservations. 
(l)  The proposed development is one (1) single family or duplex dwellings on a lot, or parcel of record prior to March 1, 1989 and the lot or parcel is in an infill area. 
(m)  The proposed development is a government facility which the City Commission finds is essential to the health or safety of persons residing in or using previously approved or existing development. 
(n)  This determination may not be satisfied by the transfer of committed capacity from a previously approved plat or DRI to another parcel of land not included within the previous plat or DRI. 
(o)  The necessary facilities are provided by any of the aforementioned methods (paragraphs (a) through (n)) for the approval of new development orders for lands which are already platted or the subsequent approval of development orders after new plats are approved. 
b.  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
1.  The design demand for the service created by existing development; and 
2.  The new design demand for the service (by phase or otherwise) that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development by the anticipated completion of other presently approved developments. 
(b)  Burden of showing compliance on developer. The burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the developer. In order to be approved, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards. The Community Development Department shall supply concurrency management forms to be completed by the developer. 
(c)  Action upon failure to show available capacity. Where available capacity cannot be shown, the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of service: 
1.  The project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service. In such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service, and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction, consistent with calculations of capacity above. 
2.  The proposed project may be altered such that projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service. 
(d)  Concurrency monitoring system. 
Generally. The following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the System For The Management of Concurrency (SYMCON). The SYMCON is based upon the City Comprehensive Plan, especially the Capital Improvements Element and adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a final development order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services. The SYMCON also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards. 
Adopted Levels of Service Shall Not Be Degraded. 
General Rule: 
1.  All applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the City. 
2.  An application for a development permit shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under which the permit is sought, and no development order is required prior to the issuance of the permit, e.g. a residence on a parcel of unplatted land. 
3.  The latest point at which concurrency is determined is the final development order. If no development is required, the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a site. 
Exception: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities, if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met. 
(1)  Responsibility. The Director of Planning and Zoning, or whomever is designated by the City Manager in the absence of the director of planning and zoning, through his duties and authority as Chairman of the Development Review Committee, shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure the development is consistent with the City of Lauderhill Comprehensive Plan. A concurrency monitoring system is instituted to verify that public facilities and services will be available at adopted levels of service concurrent with the impacts of the development on those prescribed facility or service standards. 
(2)  Development Review Committee. Applications shall be submitted for all development permits to the Community Development Department pursuant to Article II. Processing shall be in accordance with regularly scheduled meetings of the DRC, Beautification Committee, Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission. The Community Development Department shall act as the monitoring entity of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
(3)  Required information. At every stage of the development process (including but not limited to Development of Regional Impact applications for development approval, land use plan amendments, rezonings, plats, minor plat resurveys, site plans, final engineering, and buildings permits) the developer shall provide the required information about their project to the appropriate City Department for review and verification. All concurrency monitoring forms shall be forwarded to and collated by the Community Development Department for determination of Comprehensive Plan compliance. The Community Development Department shall provide to the developer a Comprehensive Plan Concurrency Monitoring System, including a matrix of required submittals based on the specific chronological stage of the development in process and the subject level of service standard, a glossary of concurrency related terminology, a standard concurrency monitoring form and other material as may be amended from time-to-time to verify and monitor concurrency. 
(4)  Concurrency rights and effective period. Compliance will be calculated and capacity reserved at time of final action of an approved site plan or enforceable developers agreement for those concurrency matters within the authority of the City of Lauderhill. Applications for development approval shall be chronologically logged to determine rights to available capacity. The concurrency time limit for plats after December 1, 1989 will be five (5) years for water, sewer, roadways, drainage, and solid waste. Developers agreements as described in Chapter 163.3220 shall offer a valid concurrency period for five (5) years or as modified by the "Florida Local Government Development Agreement Act." Site plans must be submitted for approved plats within two (2) years of plat approval and the effective time limit for site plans will be six (6) months. An extension of six (6) months may be issued by the Director of Community Development, but only if applied for in writing prior to the appropriate expiration date. At each annual renewal of public performance bonds, the City shall make a determination if the bonds shall be drawn upon for construction. Recreation concurrency shall be in effect forever. Building and engineering permits will have a concurrency time limit of one hundred eighty (180) days with renewals of one hundred eighty (180) days as long as construction and inspection continues. All renewals must be applied for in writing prior to the appropriate expiration date. 
(5)  Infrastructure construction. If infrastructure construction is necessary to meet adopted levels of service, the developer must complete construction and issue performance bonds to insure completion of work within the concurrency time limit or risk forfeiture of favorable concurrency status. If a developer in the area wishes to complete offsite infrastructure construction that may or may not be a part of other effective developers agreements, he may do so in accordance with a new developers agreement that may entail reimbursable clauses for offsite work and facility oversizing to meet area needs. The original developer will be contacted concerning the changes in work from the approved agreement. It shall first be determined by the City that modifying the original developers agreement is in the best interests of the City. In this case, the original developer must pay reasonable infrastructure costs to new developer under the terms of the original or modified developers agreement. 
(6)  Development permit approval or disapproval. Development permits shall be processed as much as possible, based on adequacy determinations. If adequacy determinations of a project show unacceptable levels of service in any one of the necessary public facility or service standards, the project shall be tabled during final action of the development permit approval. If capacity conditions change at some time in the future, concurrency shall be rechecked to verify compliance with adopted levels of service. If compliance is found the development shall be rescheduled for final action. 
(7)  Intergovernmental coordination. The Community Development Department shall coordinate concurrency activities within and outside the City. Representatives of the Committee shall act as liaisons depending on the specific level of service standard with the South Florida Regional Planning Council, Broward County and/or any other municipality or governmental entity to review technical issues of development approval. 
(8)  Annual report. 
Contents. By January 31 of each year, the City shall prepare an Annual Report on the SYMCON that includes: 
1.  A summary of actual development activity, including a summary of certificates of occupancy, indicating quantity of development represented by type and square footage. 
2.  A summary of building permit activity, indicating: 
a.  Those that expired without commencing construction; 
b.  Those that are active at the time of the report; 
c.  The quantity of development represented by the outstanding building permits; 
d.  Those that result from final development orders issued prior to the adoption of these regulations; and 
e.  Those that result from final development orders issued pursuant to the requirements of these regulations. 
3.  A summary of preliminary development orders issued, indicating: 
a.  Those that expired without subsequent final development orders; 
b.  Those that are valid at the time of the report; and 
c.  The phases and quantity of development represented by the outstanding preliminary development orders. 
4.  A summary of final development orders issued, indicating: 
a.  Those that expired without subsequent building permits; 
b.  Those that were completed during the reporting periods; 
c.  Those that are valid at the time of the report but do have associated building permits or construction activity; and 
d.  The phases and quantity of development represented by the outstanding final development orders. 
5.  An evaluation of each facility and service indicating: 
a.  The capacity available for each at the beginning of the reporting period and the end of the reporting period; 
b.  The portion of the available capacity held for valid preliminary and final development orders; 
c.  A comparison of the actual capacity to calculated capacity resulting from approved preliminary development orders and final development orders; 
d.  A comparison of actual capacity and levels of service to adopted levels of service from the City Comprehensive Plan. 
e.  A forecast of the capacity for each based upon the most recently updated schedule of capital improvements in the City Capital Improvement Element. 
Use of the annual report. The SYMCON Annual Report shall constitute prima facie evidence of the capacity and levels of service of public facilities for the purpose of issuing development orders during the twelve (12) months following completion of the annual report.

Editor's note- Formerly § 4.2. 
Sec. 7.3. - Adopted level of service. 
    7.3.1.  Transportation and other services. 
(a)  Adequacy of the Regional Road Network. The adequacy of the Regional Road Network shall be determined based upon conditions at the time the final development permit application is submitted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Levels of service (LOS). New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service for transportation systems as established in the Transportation Circulation Element of the City Comprehensive Plan: 
Type of Facility Peak Hour 
Level of Service Arterials D Collectors D Local Roads D  
(2)  Determination of project impact. The impact of proposed development activity on available design capacity shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The area of impact of the development (a traffic shed) shall be determined. The limits of the effected traffic shed area shall be determined in accordance with Broward County Land Development Code Trafficways Plan criteria. The traffic shed shall be that area where the primary impact of traffic to and from the site occurs. If the City has designated sectors of the County for determining development impacts and planning capital improvements, such sectors or planning areas may be used. If the application is for a building permit for a single-family or duplex development, the impact shall be presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot, or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot. 
b.  The projected level of service for arterials and collectors within the traffic shed shall be calculated based upon estimated trips to be generated by the project, or where applicable, the first phase of the project, and taking into consideration the impact of other approved but not completed developments within the traffic shed. Information on committed development within the traffic shed shall be provided by the City. 
c.  For the purpose of issuing development permits, the LOS for road segments operating at level of service D or better in the TRIPS model, as identified in the Broward County Administrative Code, is Level of Service D. 
d.  For the purpose of issuing development permits, the LOS for road segments operating below Level of Service D in the TRIPS model, as identified in the Broward County Administrative Code, that are constrained facilities is "110% Maintain." 
e.  For the purpose of issuing development permits, the LOS for road segments operating below level of service D in the TRIPS model, as identified in the Broward County Administrative Code, that are planned improvement facilities is "110% Maintain" and requires a finding that approval of the development would not prevent the planned improvement from achieving level of service D. 
f.  For the purpose of issuing development permits, the LOS for all road segments included within a Special Transportation Area shall be consistent with the level of service established by the plan amendment designating the Special Transportation Area. 
(2.5)  Measurement of capacities. The procedure for the initial measuring of highway capacities is the Florida DOT Table of Generalized Daily Level-of-Service Maximum Volumes made available to local government for use from January 1989 through December 1990. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data. 
Traffic analysis techniques must be technically sound and justifiable as determined by the Broward County Office of Planning. Alterations to capacity on the State Highway Network shall require the opportunity for FDOT review. 
(3)  Development subject to adequacy determination. 
(a)  For plats or replats all development of previously vacant land except that specified in subsection (c) below, shall be subject to an adequacy determination. 
(b)  For plats or replats, all development of previously improved lands shall be subject to an adequacy determination for the additional trips that equal the difference between the trips to be generated by the development specified in the proposed note on the plat and the trips generated by any existing development. Existing development shall be construed to include previous development demolished no earlier than eighteen (18) months previous to the date the final plat application is submitted,or the application for a site plan or building permit approval is submitted. 
(c)  For a replat, or an amendment to a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall be required for those additional trips that equals the difference between the previous plat and the replat; or the previous note and the proposed amendment to the note; or the development approved by the Commission and the proposed note to be placed on the plat. 
(4)  Required determinations. 
(a)  Concurrency for compact deferral areas. Before a development permit is approved, the following findings shall be made: 
(1)  A determination shall be required that the proposed development is not within the compact deferral area for a road segment operating below the adopted level of service, or that Subsection (3) below is met. Traffic studies submitted by an applicant shall be considered in reaching this determination. 
(2)  A determination shall be required that the proposed development would not create a compact deferral area including the development, or that Subsection (3) below is met. 
(3)  If the proposed development is within a compact deferral area, or will be within a compact deferral area. The development could be approved, if one (1) of the following conditions applies. 
a.  The proposed development does not place any trips on the overcapacity link. 
b.  There is an approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development; or 
c.  The necessary improvements to provide a level of service D are under construction at the time the permit is issued; or 
d.  The necessary improvements to provide level of service D are the subject of a executed contract with a road contractor for the immediate construction of the facilities; or 
e.  The necessary improvements for LOS D have been included in Broward County's or a municipal capital improvement program at the time a development permit is issued and although the facilities are not yet the subject of a binding contract for construction, the Board makes a good faith determination that a binding contract for construction of the improvement will be executed within one (1) year; or 
f.  The necessary improvements for the applicable LOS are provided for in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to Certificates of Occupancy being issued to those facilities. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to Florida Statutes, provided that road improvements required by an agreement shall not be considered for concurrence for property outside the boundaries of the property subject to a development agreement unless provisions c., d., or e., are met. 
g.  The development is authorized by an approved DRI development order. 
h.  The proposed development is found to have vested rights with regard to any affected road segments. 
i.  The proposed development is one single family or a duplex dwelling on a lot, or parcel of record prior to March 1, 1989 and the lot or parcel is in an infill area. 
j.  This determination may not be satisfied by the transfer of committed trips from a previously approved plat or DRI to another parcel of land not included within the previous plat or DRI. 
k.  The proposed development, included with all other developments, which impact the roadway, will not exceed ten (10) percent of the existing roadway volume count. 
l.  The proposed development will be an economic benefit and as a condition of approval, innovative traffic design, which will increase the capacities of the roadway or reduce the impact to the roadway. 
m.  The proposed development will be built concurrently with capacity increases to the roadways, or traffic design improvements which reduce impact. 
(b)  Adequacy of the entire regional road network. In addition to satisfying the concurrency determinations of Section (4)(a), the proposed development shall be required to address the adequacy of the remainder of the regional road network. If any road segment of the regional transportation network impacted by the proposed development lacks capacity to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development at level of service "D," it shall be determined whether such capacity will be available if all of the transportation improvements contained in the Broward County Year 2010 Plan are completed. If it is determined that such capacity will be available, then the specific improvements necessary to enable the network to reach such capacity shall be identified (hereinafter referred to as "necessary improvements") and the application shall be granted with an express condition regarding the adequacy of the regional transportation network. At the sole discretion of the City Commission, such condition shall require one of the following: 
1.  That the applicant shall construct the necessary improvements proportional to the share of the additional capacity that is needed to accommodate traffic generated by the applicant's development. 
2.  That the applicant deposit money in a "road fund" equal to the share of the cost of the improvements that would otherwise be required in subsection (1) above. 
A "road fund" shall be a nonlapsing trust fund established and maintained by the City and shall be subject to the regulations as determined by the Director of Community Development and approved by resolution by the City Commission in accordance with the provisions of this Article. The developer shall be required within ninety (90) days of the approval of the development permit to enter an agreement and provide security for the developer's share of the cost of the road improvement. Such an agreement shall require the developer to pay, within sixty (60) days of written notice by the City, any portion of the fee that is attributable to a road improvement that is advertised for construction bids, is subject to a construction contract, or is under construction. Any money paid to the City under this section shall be reimbursed to the developer if the development permit expires without recordation of the plat, or if the development permit is for a site plan approval if the site plan approval expires without building permits issued. The road fund shall be expended prior to or contemporaneously with the expenditure of any other public funds necessary for the construction of the necessary improvements for which the road fund was created. The road funds shall be expended in a manner that provides a substantial benefit to the development for which the funds were paid. The City shall owe no interest on any fund held for the "road fund." 
3.  Action plans. 
(a)  Generally. An Action Plan is a program of transportation improvements designed at a minimum to accommodate the net traffic impact of development to the extent that the regional road network lacks the available capacity to provide for the net traffic impact of development. The Action Plan shall provide substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data acceptable to the County to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the County the anticipated effect of the proposed program of improvements and/or innovations; shall provide for a source of funding for the improvements and/or innovations; and shall provide for monitoring of the program to ensure implementation of the program or improvements as necessary at or before the time the impacts of development occur. 
(b)  Reserved. 
(c)  Adequacy of potable water service. New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following levels of service for potable water as established in the Potable Water Sub-Element of the City Comprehensive Plan: 
The adequacy of potable water service shall be determined as follows: Potable water service must be available prior to occupancy to provide for the needs of the proposed development. Potable water service includes publicly and privately owned water treatment wells on individual parcels which will provide for the needs of the proposed development. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements which may be necessary to the installation and maintenance of a potable water distribution system which will meet all applicable building, health, and environmental regulations, including Chapter 17-22, Florida Administrative Code, as may be amended or changed. 
A finding that potable water service is available must be based upon a demonstration that an existing water treatment facility has sufficient capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the application. If potable water service is not available, but will be made available, the development order shall be conditioned on such availability. A finding that potable water service will be made available must be based upon a demonstration that there is an economically and fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a water treatment facility which will have sufficient capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the proposed development and for other developments in the service area, which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. 
This determination of adequacy shall be based upon a level of service standard set at one hundred thirty-five (135) gallons per day per capita. 
(d)  Drainage system. New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service for the drainage system as established in the Drainage Sub-Element of the City Comprehensive Plan: 
Type of Uses LOS All Development Discharge 25 year-1 day storm event Private/Public Road Elevation 5 year-1 day storm event Floor Elevation 100 year-3 day storm event  
(e)  Recreation. New development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following levels of service for the recreational facilities as established in the Recreation and Open Space Element of the City Comprehensive Plan. All commercially zoned properties identified in the City Comprehensive Plan that are developed for a residential use shall be required to pay the Recreation Impact Fee delineated herein and its pro rata share for any increase in the level of existing services. This shall be calculated by dividing the total number of proposed residents by level of service standard and multiply times the cost of facility or activity. 
Type of Facility Level of Service All Facilities including Regional, Community and Neighborhood 3 acres/1,000 
population  
Local Recreation 
Activity Type Standard Golf 9-Hole 1:50,000 population Baseball Field 1:6,000 population Football/Soccer Field 1:11,000 population Tennis Court 1:3,500 population Handball/Racquetball Court 1:10,000 population Basketball Court 1:5,000 population Swimming Pool 1:25,000 population Indoor Facilities Community Center 1:20,000 population Track and Field 220 Track 1:40,000 population  
(1)  A plat suitable for residential development shall be designed to provide for the park, open space and recreational needs of the future residents of the platted area, and the developer shall be required to comply with the provisions of Subsection (3) prior to the approval of the proposed plat. 
(2)  The developer of any other residential property shall be required to comply with the provisions of Subsection (c) prior to the issuance of a building permit for construction of each residential dwelling unit. 
(3)  In order to provide lands or funds or both to be used by the City of Lauderhill in order to provide additional community and neighborhood parks necessary to meet the need for such parks created by additional development, a developer must either: 
(a)  Dedicate land of suitable size, dimension, topography and general character to serve as neighborhood or community parks or a substantial portion thereof, which will meet park needs created by the development.

Sec. 5.1. - Floodplain management regulations. 
5.1.1.  Administration. 
A.  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of Lauderhill, hereinafter referred to as "this Article." 
B.  Scope. The provisions of this Article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
C.  Intent. The purposes of this Article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
D.  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This Article is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
E.  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this Article and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This Article does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this Article. 
F.  Disclaimer of Liability. This Article shall not create liability on the part of City Commission of the City of Lauderhill, Florida or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this Article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, as defined in this Article, provided the variance meets the requirements of Section 5.1.7.C.1, is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood. 
F.  Considerations for issuance of variances. In reviewing requests for variances, the Board of Adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, this Article, and the following: 
1.  The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage; 
2.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community; 
5.  The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion; 
6.  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
8.  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
G.  Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon:

2.  Determination by the Board of Adjustment that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
4.  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. 
H.  Processing times. Variances shall be processed and a final determination rendered within the time frames specified and consistent with LDR Article IV., Development Review Requirements, Part 1.0., General Application Filing, Review, and Final Determination, Section 1.3.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 06O-03-120, § 1, adopted April 10, 2006, amended the title of Schedule C to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Schedule C was entitled, "General Requirements for Building Parcels, Building Setbacks, and Yards, and Area Dimension Regulations for Lot and Tract." 

SCHEDULED D. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT REGULATIONS 
1.0. - PANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 1. - General. 
    These regulations prescribe rules and regulations governing the submission and approval of Planned Unit Developments (P.U.D.) within the City of Lauderhill, Florida. 
Sec. 2. - Intent and purpose. 
    2.01. It is intended that this district be utilized to permit great flexibility in the use and design of structures and land in situations where modification of specific provisions of these regulations will not be contrary to the intent and purposes or inconsistent with the comprehensive plan upon which they are based, and will not be harmful to the neighborhoods in which they occur. 
    2.02. Regulations for Planned Unit Developments are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning, subdivision, and other applicable City regulations to the same degree that such regulations are intended to control development on a lot-by-lot basis. In view of the substantial public advantages of Planned Unit Development, it is the intent of P.U.D. regulations to promote and encourage development in this form where tracts suitable in size, location, and character for such uses and structures proposed are to be planned and developed in a unified and coordinated manner. 
Sec. 3. - Definitions. 
    3.01.  Comprehensive plan: A composite of the written and graphical proposals recommending the physical, social, and economic development of the City of Lauderhill, which has been adopted by the Planning and Zoning Board and by the City Commission, and may have been amended from time to time. 
    3.02.  Gross area: The total surface (land and water) area contained within the proposed P.U.D., including on-site streets and rights-of-way, but excluding previously dedicated rights-of-way. 
    3.03.  Gross density: The density of a building site calculated by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the total acreage of the site without reduction of any non-residential uses such as parks, waterways, shops, churches, schools, etc. 
    3.04.  Open space: A generally unobstructed parcel or area of land permanently dedicated or reserved for the use and enjoyment of owners and occupants of the land within the P.U.D. Required open space shall be of a pervious nature and shall not be used for private roadways open to vehicular circulation, off-street parking, or loading berths. Lakes, canals, and other features may be considered as required open spaces to the extent of the limitations contained herein at the Open Space Requirement and Computation Section. 
    3.05. A Planned Unit Development shall be defined as follows: 
3.0501. A P.U.D. is land under unified control, planned and developed as a whole, in a single development operation or an approved programmed series of development operations for dwelling units and related uses and facilities. 
3.0502. A P.U.D. may include principal and accessory uses and structures substantially related to the character of the development itself and the surrounding area of which it is apart. 
3.0503. A P.U.D. shall be developed according to comprehensive and detailed plans which include streets, utilities, lots, building sites and the like, and site plans, floor plans, and elevations for all buildings intended to be located, constructed, used, and related to one another, and detailed plans for other uses and improvements on the land related to the buildings, and; 
3.0504. A P.U.D. shall include a program for full provision, maintenance, and operation of such areas. Improvements, facilities, and services for common use by the occupants of the Planned Unit Development, which will not necessarily be provided, operated, or maintained at public expense. 
    3.06.  Unified control: All land included for purpose of development with P.U.D. District shall be under the control of the applicant (an individual, partnership, or corporation or group of individuals, partnerships, or corporations). The applicant shall present satisfactory legal documents to constitute evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed P.U.D. which shall be certified by the City Attorney. Applicant shall agree in the application for rezoning to the following: 
3.0601. To proceed with the proposed development according to the provisions of these regulations and conditions attached to the rezoning of the land to P.U.D. 
3.0602. To provide agreements, contracts, covenants, deed restrictions, and sureties acceptable to the City for completion of the development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning to P.U.D. and for continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions, and facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated, or maintained at public expense; and 
3.0603. To bind their successors in title to any commitments made under the above. All agreements and evidence of unified control shall be examined by the City Attorney and no rezoning of land to P.U.D. classification shall be adopted without a certification by the City Attorney that such agreements and evidence of unified control meet the requirements of these regulations. 
Sec. 4. - Uses permitted. 
    The uses permitted shall be as follows and subject to the limitations of Section 5, below: 
    4.01. All uses permitted in any of the residential zoning districts. 
    4.02. All uses permitted in the C-3 district of the zoning regulations. 
Sec. 5. - General requirements and special regulations. 
    5.01.  Minimum size. All planned unit developments shall contain a minimum of twenty (20) acres of contiguous land, unless the Planning and Zoning Board finds that a tract which contains less than twenty (20) acres, but not less than ten (10) acres, is suitable as a P.U.D. by virtue of some unusual conditions. This minimum may then be waived by the City Commission, by resolution, upon the recommendation of the Board. 
    5.02.  Maximum area limitations. Pursuant to more specific requirements and regulations as hereinafter prescribed, the following percentages express the maximum land area of the Planned Unit Development that the special land uses may occupy: 
5.0201. Residential: 40% of gross area. 
5.0202. Commercial: 12% of gross area. 
5.0203. Hospital and Convalescent: 11% of gross area. 
    5.03.  Minimum area limitations. Planned Unit Developments shall contain areas at least equal to the following: 
5.0301. Open space: 30% of gross area. 
5.0302. Governmental Services*: 5% of gross area. 
*Said land shall be dedicated to the City of Lauderhill in accordance with Section 7.0204 herein. 
    5.04.  Maximum density. The maximum gross density of residential dwelling units per acre permitted within any proposed P.U.D. shall not exceed the combined density recommendation of the Comprehensive Plan over the area where a particular P.U.D. is proposed. For the purpose of density calculations, non-residential land uses recommended by the Plan shall be considered as "low-density residential." 
    For example, consider a proposed P.U.D. of fifty (50) acres. The recommended land uses of the Comprehensive Plan are: 
Low Density Residential-30 acres × 3.9 D.U./Acre = 117 D.U. 
Medium Density Residential-10 acres × 15.9 D.U./Acre = 159 D.U. 
Commercial-10 acres × 3.9 D.U./Acre = 30 D.U. 
Total Units 315. The maximum density would therefore be: 315 D.U.-50 acres of 6.3 D.U./Acre. 
    5.05.  Minimum lot area, distance between structures, frontage and setbacks. 
5.0501. No minimum lot size shall be required within a Planned Unit Development District. 
5.0502. No minimum distance between structures shall be required within a Planned Unit Development District. 
5.0503. Each dwelling unit or other permitted use shall have access to a public street either directly, or indirectly via a private approach road, pedestrian way, court or other area dedicated by common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not necessarily required to front on a dedicated road. The City shall be allowed access on privately owned roadways, easements and common open space to insure the police and fire protection of the area, to meet emergency needs, to conduct City services, and to generally insure the health and safety of the residents of the Planned Unit Development. 
5.0504. There are no required setbacks or yards except the following: 
There shall be a setback or yard of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth abutting all public road rights-of-way within or abutting a Planned Unit Development District. 
There shall be a peripheral setback from boundary lines of the P.U.D. of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in depth. Except for accessways, no portion of this peripheral setback may be used for parking or other vehicular use area. 
    5.06.  Off-street parking and loading requirements. Off-street parking and loading requirements shall not deviate from the requirements of the Land Development Regulations. 
    5.07.  Landscaping requirements. The landscaping requirements shall not deviate from existing requirements. 
    5.08.  Underground utilities. Within the Planned Unit Development, all utilities including telephone, television, television cable, and electrical systems shall be installed underground. Primary facilities providing service to the site may be exempted from this requirement. Large transformers shall be placed on the ground and contained within pad mounts, enclosures or vaults. The developer shall provide adequate landscaping with shrubs and plants to screen all utility facilities permitted above ground. 
    5.09.  Open space requirement and computation. A Planned Unit Development shall exhibit and maintain a total open space requirement at least equal to thirty-five percent (35%) of the gross area of the P.U.D. The following areas qualify wholly or partially as open space: 
5.0901. If the major recreation use is concentrated in a localized section of the P.U.D. with less than thirty percent (30%) of the residential dwelling units abutting it, only fifty percent (50%) of the area adjacent to the facility may count toward the open space requirement. 
5.0902. If, however, the major recreation use is dispersed throughout the P.U.D. with between thirty (30) and sixty (60) percent of the residential dwelling units abutting it, seventy-five percent (75%) of the area contained therein may count toward the open space requirement. 
5.0903. If more than sixty percent (60%) of the residential dwelling units abut the major recreation use, one hundred percent (100%) of the area contained therein may count toward the open space requirement. 
5.0904. The area occupied by a multiple-use recreation building and its attendant outdoor recreation facilities, excluding a golf course, may be included as open space. 
5.0905. Any privately maintained or owned exterior open space adjacent to and for the exclusive use by the residents of an individual dwelling unit, enclosed or partially enclosed by fences, walls, or hedges, may be considered toward meeting the total open space requirement, provided, the total area contained therein does not exceed five percent (5%) of the gross area of the P.U.D., nor decreases the amount of ground level common open space below thirty percent (30%) of the gross area of the P.U.D. 
5.0906. All previous land areas within the peripheral setback may be included. 
5.0907. The area contained in public and private streets right-of-way is not considered as open space and receives no credit toward the open space requirement. 
5.0908. All privately-owned common open space shall conform to its intended use and remain as delineated in the master development plan through the inclusion in all deeds of appropriate covenants. Said deed restrictions shall run with the land and be for the benefit of present as well as future property owners. 
5.0909. All common open space as well as public and recreation facilities shall be specifically included in the development plan schedule and be constructed and fully improved by the developer at an equivalent or greater rate than the construction of residential structures. At least once every sixty (60) days, the building official shall inspect the P.U.D. site and examine the construction which has taken place on the site. If the rate of construction of dwelling units is greater than the rate which common open space and recreational facilities have been constructed and provided, no further building permits shall be issued until the proper ratio has been provided. 
5.0910. Fifty percent (50%) of the area contained in manmade water bodies and canals with average water width of more than sixty (60) feet may be considered toward meeting the open space requirements. Man-made water bodies with average water width of less than sixty (60) feet shall not be considered toward meeting the open space requirements. 
5.0911. If the water body is natural and the shoreline vegetation will not be disturbed by the development, one hundred percent (100%) of the area contained therein may be counted as open space. 
5.0912. If natural habitats of unique and significant value are determined to exist, the Planning and Zoning Board may require the area so defined be left in an undisturbed state and adequately protected or incorporated into the design of the P.U.D. as a passive recreation area with a minimum of improvements permitted. In either case, one hundred percent (100%) of the area contained therein may be counted as open space. 
5.0913. The area contained in a continuous open space pedestrian system, consisting of permanently maintained walks and trails not more than twelve (12) feet wide leading to a natural amenity, recreation facility, or commercial use, offering internal pedestrian w walkways that are divorced from roads and streets, may be included as open space. 
5.0914. The area contained in mini-parks, which may or may not be a part of the open space system, but contain at least one (1) acre and have a minimum dimension of one hundred (100) feet together with, but not limited to, one of the following: benches, playground apparatus, barbecue pits, may be included as open space. 
    5.10.  Limitations applying to commercial uses. No business shall be permitted in a Planned Unit Development until Certificates of Occupancy for no less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total planned residential floor area or 100 residential dwelling units have been issued by the City. 
    5.11.  Professional services required. Any plans submitted as part of a petition for a Planned Unit Development shall certify that the services of two (2) or more of the following professionals were utilized in the design or planning process; and shall state their names and businesses and addresses: 
5.1101. A planner who by reason of his education and experience is qualified to become, or is, a full member of the American Planning Association.

5.1105. A land surveyor registered by the State of Florida. 
Sec. 6. - Rezoning of land to P.U.D. 
    On application for rezoning of land to P.U.D. classification, the Planning and Zoning Board and City Commission shall proceed in general as for other applications for rezoning of land giving special consideration, however, to the following matters and requirements, and allowing changes in the rezoning application prior to the required Planning and Zoning Board public hearing, as follows: 
    6.01. Procedures. 
6.0101.  Pre-hearing conference. On request by the applicant, the Planning and Zoning Board, Director of Community Development, and representatives of other City departments shall meet with the applicant and/or his agent to review a general concept plan, which shall include a boundary map of the proposed P.U.D., the proposed pattern of land use, the proposed number and type of dwelling units and densities, proposed streets and circulation, and proposed open spaces, an outline of the petition for rezoning; and other plans, maps and documents deemed necessary for a pre-hearing conference. The purpose of such a pre-hearing conference or conferences shall be to determine that the proposed development is not premature. 
Prior to the formal submission of a petition for rezoning, the general concept plan shall be approved by the Planning and Zoning Board as to land use, density, streets and circulation, and open space, and shall thereafter be the basis for the petition for rezoning. 
In the course of such pre-hearing conferences, any recommendations for changes shall be recorded in writing and shall become part of the record in the case. Pre-hearing conferences shall be continued until a general concept plan and petition is approved by the Planning and Zoning Board; however, approval of a general concept plan shall in no manner imply that the applicant has satisfied the conditions and requirements for rezoning. 
6.0102.  Public hearing. At such times as further conferences appear unnecessary, the applicant may present his formal petition and supporting data for rezoning, as set forth herein. 
A public hearing date shall be established at the next regularly scheduled Planning and Zoning Board meeting. Thereafter, public notice shall be given and a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Board on the petition for rezoning shall be held in the same manner as for other applications for rezoning, in accordance with the zoning regulations and requirements of these regulations. 
6.0103.  Planning and Zoning Board findings and recommendations. After the closing of the public hearing, the Planning and Zoning Board may recommend to the City Commission that the P.U.D. rezoning be approved, subject to stated stipulations and conditions, or disapproved. In making its recommendation, the Planning and Zoning Board shall find that the plans, maps, and documents submitted by the applicant and presented at the public hearing do or do not establish that the applicant has met the requirements of these regulations, and in addition: 
(A)  The requirements of unified control; 
(B)  The internal P.U.D. standards; 
(C)  The tract for the proposed P.U.D. is suitable in terms of its relationships to the Comprehensive Plan and the area surrounding the proposed development can continue to be developed in coordination and substantial compatibility with the P.U.D. proposed, including overall dwelling unit or building density and peripheral transitions in such density; 
(D)  That the proposed modifications of zoning or other regulations as applied to the particular case, justify such modification of regulations. 
6.0104.  Conditions and stipulations. In recommending rezoning of land to P.U.D. classification, the Planning and Zoning Board may recommend and the City Commission may attach, suitable conditions, safeguards, and stipulations, in accord with the standards set forth in the P.U.D. and Land Development Regulations. The conditions, safeguards, and stipulations so made at the time of rezoning to P.U.D. shall be binding upon the applicant or his successors in interest. Deviations from approved plans except in the manner herein set out or failure to comply with any requirement, condition, or safeguard, shall constitute a violation of these regulations. It is intended that no condition, safeguard, or stipulation be required which is unreasonable. Such conditions, safeguards, and stipulations shall be clearly related to the intent and purposes of the Land Development Regulations and this Schedule. 
6.0105.  City Commission consideration. Upon receipt of the Planning and Zoning Board recommendation, the City Commission shall schedule a public hearing to consider the rezoning petition as recommended by the Board. After the requisite public notice, the City Commission shall act in accordance with the procedures for rezoning generally. 
6.02.  Information required. In addition to information required for application for rezoning generally, the applicant shall submit the following materials or data in the form of a petition for rezoning: 
6.0201. Legal documents assuring unified control of the proposed P.U.D. and any agreements required by the Planning and Zoning Board. 
6.0202. Tabulations of total gross acreage in the P.U.D. and percentages thereof proposed to be devoted to the several dwelling types, other permitted uses, park and recreational facilities, open spaces, schools, streets and rights-of-way, and other reservations of land. Tabulations shall also show the proposed number and types of dwelling units and densities. 
6.0203. A P.U.D. Rezoning Development Plan. At the time the petition for rezoning to P.U.D. is filed, the petitioner shall submit as part of said petition, in fifteen (15) identical copies, a P.U.D. development plan for the proposed P.U.D., including a written description and maps, reproduced and bound in a report format not to exceed eleven (11) inches by seventeen (17) inches in size, which shall include not less than the following materials:

SCHEDULE H. - NON-CONFORMING LAND USE PROVISIONS 
    1.1.  Existing uses. Any lawful use of land or structure existing on June 11, 1990, and which by its terms has become a nonconforming use, is hereby declared not to be in violation of these regulations. Such a nonconforming use shall be subject to all of the provisions of these regulations pertaining to its continuance, change, and discontinuance. 
    1.2.  Nonconforming use; extension. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout any part of a building clearly designed for such use but not so used on June 11, 1990. Any nonconforming use which occupied a portion of a building not originally designed or intended for such use shall not be extended to any other part of the building. No nonconforming use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building nor any additional building on the same plot not used for such nonconforming use at the effective date of this code. The nonconforming use of land shall not be extended to any additional land not so used at the effective date of this code. 
    1.3.  Nonconforming use; repair, alternation, enlargement. No structure utilized for a nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, unless the use is changed to one which complies with the provisions of these regulations. Provided, that repairs, maintenance and improvement may be carried out in any one (1) year in an amount not to exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the assessed value of the structure for that year, and provided that such work does not increase the cubical content of the building nor the floor area devoted to the nonconforming use, nor increase the number of dwelling units. Nothing in this section shall prevent compliance with applicable laws or ordinances relative to the safety and sanitation of a building occupied by a nonconforming use, but if those laws or ordinances are applied to the nonconforming use, the terms of this section also be applied thereto. 
    1.4.  Reconstruction after catastrophe. If any nonconforming structure, or building in which there is a nonconforming use, is damaged by fire, flood, explosion, collapse, wind, war or other catastrophe to such an extent that the cost of rebuilding, repair and reconstruction will exceed seventy-five (75) percent of the replacement cost of the building or structure, it shall not be again used or reconstructed except in full conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
    1.5.  Change of nonconforming use: 
1.5.1. In any residential district, any change of a nonconforming use in a conforming building shall be to a conforming use. 
1.5.2. In any residential district, a nonconforming use in a nonconforming building shall be changed only to a use permitted in the particular residential district involved, except as provided in paragraph 1.5.3. 
1.5.3. There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or management of a nonconforming use, provided there is no change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use, except as may be permitted by the zoning code. 
1.5.4. In a non-residential district, a nonconforming use in a nonconforming structure may be replaced by a new or different use permissible in the same zoning district as the original nonconforming use or in a more restricted zoning district, if the City Commission, after public hearing, finds that the new or different use will be less detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood than the old use, and approves the new or different use as being in accordance with the spirit and purpose of these regulations. 
1.5.5. Any change of a nonconforming use of land, except as incidental to a change of a nonconforming use of a nonconforming structure permitted and approved under paragraph 1.5.4., shall be to a conforming use.

    1.7.  Unlawful use not authorized. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of the continuance of the use or a structure or premises in violation of any ordinance in effect on June 11, 1990. 
    1.8.  District or regulation change. The foregoing provisions of this code shall also apply to buildings, structures, land, premises or uses which hereafter become nonconforming due to a change in district regulations.

    1.10.  Illegal use. The casual, temporary or illegal use of land or a building shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use or to create any rights in the continuance of such a use. 
    1.11.  Zoning certificate for nonconforming use. After the effective date of these regulations, or any amendment thereto, the owner and operator of any use, which by the terms of this section or any amendment thereto, is or becomes a nonconforming use, shall be notified by the Community Development Department of the provisions of this section which may be in effect at the time of such notification. Within sixty (60) days of the receipt of said notification, the owner or operator shall apply to the Community Development Department for a certificate for the nonconforming use, which certificate, after verification of the facts of the nonconforming use, shall be duly and promptly issued to the applicant. The applicant for such certificate shall indicate the location, nature and extent of the nonconforming use and such other details as may be pertinent thereto. If the owner or operator of a nonconforming use fails to properly apply for a certificate within sixty (60) days after receipt of the aforesaid notice, the nonconforming use ceases to be a permissible nonconforming use and is hereby declared to be in violation of this section. If the Community Development Director shall find, upon reviewing the application for a certificate, that the existing use is illegal or in violation of other laws or ordinances, or if he finds that a building for which a certificate is requested has been constructed for the existing use or any other use without full compliance with the building code or zoning district regulations in effect at the time of construction or alteration, he shall not issue the certificate, but shall declare such use to be in violation of this section and take appropriate action. 
    1.12.  Nonconforming lots. These Land Development Regulations shall not be construed to prevent the construction of a single-family dwelling unit on any undeveloped lot of record notwithstanding the fact that such lot may have a lesser area or street frontage than is required in the particular zoning district; in which case building setbacks shall be made to conform to existing building setbacks on the same street in the same block. 
    1.13.  Existing special exception uses. Any special exception use existing on January 1, 2006, and for which the City Commission has not adopted a resolution allowing such special exception use is a nonconforming use.

Sec. 15.0. - Dynamic displays. 
    15.1. Findings and conclusions. The City Commission makes the following findings of fact and conclusions to support Schedule I., Sections 15.0 and 16.0: 
a.  Studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers. Distraction can lead to traffic accidents. Drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message, but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message. Drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur. Drivers also are distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look. People have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end. Additionally, drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message, such as fade-ins and fade-outs. Finally, drivers generally are more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message. Time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short, easily absorbed, and become inaccurate without frequent changes. 
b.  Despite these public safety concerns, there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages. Except as prohibited by state or federal law, sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain conditions or restrictions. The conditions or restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in those zoning districts where signs can adversely impact the character of the area within the zoning district. 
c.  Local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included. Without those requirements, however, there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway. If more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road, the minimum display time becomes critical. If the display time is too short, a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement. This impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs. If dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each sign's ability to change frequently, drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload. Therefore, a longer display time is appropriate. 
d.  A constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination. Changing messages detract from this way-finding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct through last-second lane changes, stops, or turns, which could result in traffic accidents. Accordingly, dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign. 
e.  In conclusion, the City Commission finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety. 
    15.2. Regulatory conditions or restrictions. Dynamic display signs are allowed subject to the following conditions: 
a.  One (1) double-faced dynamic display pylon sign is allowed within a unified development that is located within the Open Space and Recreational (S-1) and Commercial Recreation (CR) zoning districts, [and] the Regional Park (PR) and the Commercial Entertainment (CE) zoning districts. Within S-1 and CR zoning districts, dynamic displays are limited to property with a minimum size of one hundred fifty (150) acres, a maximum height of fifty-three (53) feet as measured from the average grade to the top of the structure, and abutting an arterial road with an ultimate minimum right-of-way of at least one hundred ten (110) feet according to the Broward County Trafficways Plan Map (2008); 
b.  A site plan or site plan modification development order approving a dynamic display sign is a pre-requisite to the issuance of a building permit for the sign. The maximum sign height, sign area, and sign face size shall be established through the site plan or site plan modification process but the sign area shall not exceed three hundred sixty (360) square feet. That portion of the sign area outside of the sign face shall not have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used. Only one (1) contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face; 
c.  A dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every eight (8) seconds, except one for which changes are necessary to correct hour-and-minute, date, or temperature information. Time, date, or temperature information is considered one (1) dynamic display and may not be included as a component of any other dynamic display. A display of time, date, or temperature must remain for at least one (1) minute before changing to a different display, but the time, date, or temperature information itself may change no more often than once every three (3) seconds. The images and messages displayed must be static, and the transition from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any special effects. Any commercial messages displayed on a dynamic display sign must be related to the land uses on the premises or to products and services provided to the premises by suppliers or by sponsors of events and activities occurring at the premises; 
d.  The images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves, without sequencing or continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign; 
e.  Every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at least: 
1.  Five (5) inches in height on a road with a speed limit of fifteen (15) to twenty-five (25) miles per hour; 
2.  Seven (7) inches in height on a road with a speed limit of twenty-five (25) to thirty-four (34) miles per hour; 
3.  Nine (9) inches on a road with a speed limit of thirty-five (35) to forty-four (44) miles per hour; 
4.  Twelve (12) inches on a road with a speed limit of forty-five (45) to fifty-four (54) miles per hour; and 
5.  Fifteen (15) inches on a road with a speed limit of fifty-five (55) miles per hour or more. 
If there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of this size in the area allowed under paragraph b. above, then a dynamic display is not allowed; 
f.  Dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the device in one (1) position if a malfunction occurs. The displays also must be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions, and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the City that it is not complying with the standards of this section; 
g.  Dynamic displays must comply with the brightness standards contained in Section 16; 
h.  Each dynamic display sign shall be programmed to set-aside a minimum five (5) percent of the time (seventy-two (72) minutes per day) for public service announcements, such as Amber Alerts, Emergency Evacuation Information, and City public service or event announcements; 
i.  A dynamic display scoreboard sign is allowed within the Local Park and Regional Park zoning district. Animated or video displays are allowed on scoreboards; and 
j.  Dynamic display signs existing on September 25 th , 2008 must comply with the Schedule I standards and requirements before January 1 st , 2010. An existing dynamic display sign that is not brought into conformance with the Schedule I standards and requirements by January 1 st , 2010 may continue after that date but shall be deemed a nonconforming structure pursuant to Schedule H and not to Section 10 of this Schedule. An existing dynamic display sign that cannot meet the minimum text size requirement in paragraph f. must use the largest size possible for one line of copy to fit in the available space.

14.  The irrigation systems installed may be a sprinkler irrigation system or a drip irrigation system. A combination of these two systems is permitted and may be required to efficiently water landscaping, and minimize water waste. When using the drip irrigation system, mulch is required to hide the drip tube from view and to add to the life expectancy of the system. The irrigation system shall be zoned so that each group of plants with similar water needs receives only the amount of water required to maintain the plant. 
15.  Where established native vegetation is incorporated into the landscape design, irrigation of those areas may not be required. 
    1.2.2. Installation. 
A.  All landscaping material shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and according to accepted good planting procedures with quality of plant materials as hereinafter described and be properly fertilized at the time of installation. A qualified representative of the City charged with the issuance of building permits shall inspect all landscaping following installation within seven (7) calendar days of proper notification of such completion. No permanent certificate of occupancy will be issued unless the landscaping meets the requirements herein provided.

C.  Landscape areas in vehicular use areas shall be provided with an approved means of landscape protection, such as curbing or wheel stops to prevent vehicular encroachment. 
D.  All trees shall be properly guyed and staked at the time of planting to ensure establishment and erect growth. Trees shall be restaked in the event of blow-overs or other failure of the staking and guying. Nail staking or other methods which cause cosmetic or biological damage to the tree are prohibited. Wells at the base of all trees or palms will be required after planting, and shall have a minimum diameter of at least three (3) feet and the same shall contain mulch. 
E.  No soil is to be removed from the dripline of any tree that is to remain in its original location without permission of the Planning and Zoning Director. Approval shall be based upon at least one (1) of the following conditions: 
1.  An environmental effort to preserve an existing tree that could not otherwise be saved; 
2.  Public safety; 
3.  City utility service repair. 
F.  In order to reduce the transpiration rate of plant material during relocation of trees and plants, practices such as leaf striping, frond removal, the use of anti-transpirants, or other acceptable policies in the nursery industry, according to plant type, shall be used. These techniques shall be documented by organizations such as Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Florida Cooperative Extension Services or Florida Division of Forestry. 
G.  Plants shall be grouped together by irrigation demands. 
H.  A minimum of three (3) inches layer of mulch is required in planting beds. Mulch may be substituted for grass or groundcover in areas where it would require extensive water, or the grass or groundcover could not cover an area completely. 
I.  Walls, fences, shrubs beds or hedges can be used as windbreaks to reduce wind velocity to reduce water loss due to evaporation during irrigation and by evapo-transpiration from plant materials. 
J.  With approval of the Planning and Zoning Director, and the City Engineer, artificial turf may be permitted in place of grass or other ground cover. 
K.  Avoiding sign conflicts. Trees and landscaping shall be installed so as to avoid impeding visibility of any sign as seen from the abutting right-of-way. The Planning and Zoning Director, through the site plan or site plan modification process, shall have the authority to allow the relocation of landscaping to effectuate this provision. 
    1.2.3. Maintenance. 
A.  The owner shall be continually responsible for maintaining all landscaped areas including lawn areas in good condition so as to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, free of disease, refuse, and debris. If any living or nonliving landscape material or plant is destroyed, severely damaged, or poorly maintained regardless of cause, the City will notify the owner in writing of such problem. 
B.  The owner will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of said notification to either replace the landscape material with equivalent healthy, new material, or to provide the maintenance necessary to bring the material back to an acceptable condition, within three (3) months, unless determined by the Planning and Zoning Director that the property owner requires a reasonable extension, as to be decided by the Planning and Zoning Director. 
C.  Should the owner fail to respond within the above time period following written notification by the City, the City will report the matter to the Chief Code Enforcement Officer. The City may also use its own resources to correct the problem. 
D.  All watering and fertilizing of the planted areas and the fertilizing of lawns shall be managed so as to: 
1.  Maintain healthy flora; 
2.  Make plant material more drought tolerant; 
3.  Avoid expensive turf growth; 
4.  Minimize fungus growth; 
5.  Stimulate deep root growth; 
6.  Minimize leaching of fertilizer; 
7.  Minimize cold damage; and 
8.  Avoid weed growth. 
E.  Avoiding sign conflicts. Trees and landscaping shall be maintained so as to avoid impeding visibility of any sign as seen from the abutting right-of-way. Such maintenance shall allow full view of all permitted signage on property. Monument signs and façade signs that face the road shall be visible from the public right-of-way. If landscaping cannot be trimmed or relocated, signs must be removed or relocated.

C.  Fire hydrant spacing & flow requirements. Fire hydrant spacing and water flow requirements for all fire hydrants throughout the City shall conform to the table set forth below and made a part hereof. Distances shown in said table shall be measured only in directions that a fire hose can be laid, and it shall be interpreted herein that a fire hose cannot be laid across any street having a width greater than twenty-four (24) feet of pavement. All fire hydrants shall have a minimum of twenty (20) pounds per square inch residual pressure while flowing the required flow as indicated in the table below. The Chief Engineering Official may require additional fire hydrants or water flow or both where the Chief Engineering Official deems it necessary. 
The table to be used for minimum fire hydrant spacing and flow requirements is as follows: 
Zoning 
District Maximum Fire 
Hydrant Spacing 
(feet) Minimum 
Gallons 
per Minute Minimum 
Pipe Size RS-4, RS-5 500 
(All portions of each structure to be within a maximum of 150 linear feet from the nearest hydrant) 1,000 6" RM-8, RM-5 300 
(All portions of each structure to be within a maximum of 150 linear feet from the nearest hydrant) 1,500 8" RM-18, RM-22, RM-45, RM-50, CO-1, C-2, C-3, CF, CR 650 
(All portions of each structure to be within a maximum of 325 linear feet from the nearest hydrant) 2,000 8" S-1 Same as RS-4 above, provided that no permanent structures greater than 500 square feet are constructed, the Chief Engineering Official shall determine where permanent structures are constructed the spacing and flow requirements. I-1, U-1, C-4 300 
(All portions of each structure to be within a maximum of 150 linear feet from the nearest hydrant) 2,500 8"  
Insurance Services Office Method (ISO): The ISO's technique for calculating required fire flow is documented in their publication "Fire Suppression Rating Schedule". The term used in that document to describe the fire flow requirement is needed fire flow (NFF). The calculation for NFF is as follows: 
NFFi = (Ci)(Oi)(X+P)i 
  where 
    Ci = construction factor 
    Oi = occupancy factor 
    Xi = exposure factor 
    Pi = communication factor 
NOTE: The City of Lauderhill Fire Department must be contacted for fire flow tests prior to the calculation of required fire flow.

The Road and Parking Design Standards provide principles and requirements that aim to create an integrated system of circulation that is conducive to pedestrian and vehicular safety. These standards outline the design requirements for typical rights-of-way and provide illustrations for further clarification. This section also enumerates basic parking requirements for the City of Lauderhill. 
    The sections are meant to promote development, redevelopment and improvements that fulfill all the desired criteria with respect to image, scale and livability. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 2, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 2. - General design standards. 
    The design standards and guidelines contained herein in Schedule P shall apply when one (1) or more of the following circumstances occur: 
  New development; or 
  Redevelopment, which is defined as the demolition of any structure or building or a portion thereof and the construction of new improvements on a site or sites intended to be; or 
  Substantial improvements, which is defined as any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure which increases the building area or size of the original structure by ten (10) percent of more; or 
  Any development or improvements within the RT-15 zoning district; or 
  Service station re-branding or re-imaging. 
    2.1.  Design objectives. Specific site design objectives will be drawn up based on the conclusions and observations derived from the site analysis. However, all design shall aim toward fulfilling the following basic goals: 
 Encourage appropriate building massing where scale, function and light requirements are well respected. 
 Provide appropriate transitions between pedestrian and vehicular zones in order to ensure safety and mobility. 
 Minimize negative environmental impacts such as air, light and noise pollution, excessive surface drainage, etc. through appropriate and effective landscape design. 
 Provide efficient systems of circulation which are compliant with existing development codes and parking standards. 
 Create a strong and viable community environment where outdoor activities and positive interaction between neighborhoods is enhanced through effective design. 
    2.2.  Contextual relationships. Any new development, redevelopment, substantial improvements or service station re-branding shall contribute positively to existing neighborhoods and communities. Therefore, it is important that all plans and proposals take into account the value, architectural quality, physical connectivity and landscape character of adjacent sites. 
All plan documents shall show, in adequate detail, neighboring buildings and important site features of adjacent areas such that they facilitate the evaluation of relationships between any proposed development and the context within which it is situated. 
When considering connectivity to adjacent areas, it is required that existing street patterns and sidewalks extend to connect to existing circulation patterns. This measure is to ensure a continuous and cohesive circulation system throughout the City. It is also important to link new development to established, existing areas in order to encourage internal circulation by pedestrians, bicycles and motorized vehicles. Such measures guarantee that proposed development does not occur against the grain of the existing fabric, but is instead conducive to it. 
Specifically, all applicants for new development, redevelopment, substantial improvements or service station re-branding are required to submit a complete analysis of existing conditions, both on site and on adjacent properties. Such an analysis will include an examination of the site's physical elements, amenities and opportunities and constraints. This analysis shall be executed by a licensed design professional. Although the process and submittal requirements might vary by project, the following basic information would usually be required: 
 General location map; and 
 Overall adjacent land use map and views, i.e., street elevations; and 
 Property boundaries; and 
 Street and right-of-way locations; and 
 Existing built structures; and 
 Existing vegetation-Species counts, location and sizes; and 
 Existing topography and drainage. 
    2.3.  Purpose or intent. The City of Lauderhill Design Standards and Guidelines are intended to implement the Comprehensive Plan, supplement these existing Land Development Regulations, and conform to the most recent edition of the building codes. 
    2.4.  Florida Building Code. All proposed development, redevelopment, building and structural improvements are required to comply with and conform to the most recent version of the applicable Florida Building Code, as amended from time to time. Site design recommendations shall adhere to the planning codes enumerated in the sections on Building Code and Florida Residential Code. Among other standards, the ones pertaining to building heights, location of exterior walls, dwelling unit separation, exterior coverings and exterior wall finishes are particularly relevant and shall be used as a general foundation for all site design. 
    2.5.  ADA Standards for Accessible Design. All site design has to take into account the standards enumerated in the "ADA Standards for Accessible Design" handbook. This handbook includes standards for various categories of design, involving both interior and exterior spaces. All site design shall adhere to Section 4.1.2-Accessible Sites and Exterior Facilities, which lists the necessary requirements for any new construction including but not limited to, accessibility, ground surfaces, parking and signage. All building design shall conform to the latest edition of the Federal ADA Code and/or local municipal requirements. 
    2.6.  LEED Design Standards. Site design shall aim toward conforming to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Standards as much as possible. The LEED for New Construction and major renovation Rating System shall be utilized for all buildings constructed and intended for City use. The City strives for LEED "Silver" Certified buildings. LEED for Neighborhood Development, which is in its pilot phase, shall also serve as a guiding principle under which design recommendations will be made. The following are the primary mandates of the LEED System: 
 Reducing urban sprawl 
 Encouraging healthy living 
 Protecting threatened species 
 Increasing transportation choices and decreasing automobile dependence 
 Creating sustainable sites 
 Enhancing water efficiency 
 Optimizing energy performance 
 Recycling materials 
 Creating innovative design solutions 
    These objectives are accompanied by a detailed checklist that includes parameters such as bicycle networks, restoration of habitat, diversity of uses, walkable streets, percentage water-use reduction, storm water design, construction waste management, daylight and views, etc. All design shall be assessed against such criteria and attempts shall be made to adhere closely to the list and to avoid shortfalls. This checklist shall serve not only as a measure of successful design but also as a guiding document governing the design for most situations. It is suggested that all design, development and redevelopment projects seek out design professionals with LEED certified team members. It is also recommended that relevant examples be researched and used as inspiration for projects where applicable. These projects could range from instate sites to national examples with similar contexts. More information can be found on the US Green Building Council website: http://www.usgbc.org/ 
    2.7.  CPTED Standards. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is an important factor in determining the efficiency of any site design. CPTED's goal is to prevent crime by designing a physical environment that positively influences human behavior. These standards include aspects such as access control and surveillance through natural means such as landscaping and street design. These include techniques such as keeping pathways unobstructed, discouraging through traffic, landscaping that avoids blind spots or hiding spots, keeping open/green spaces in visual proximity to homes and effective lighting. It is important that neighborhoods promote a sense of safety and comfort and CPTED standards therefore become an integral part of good design. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 3, 2-22-2010; Ord. No. 11O-04-120, §§ 1, 2, 4-25-2011; Ord. No. 14O-02-105, § 11, 3-31-2014; Ord. No. 14O-12-161, § 11, 1-12-2015) 
Sec. 3. - Architectural standards. 
    Architectural standards aim to guide the articulation of buildings with regards to massing, façade treatments and elements. All these aspects form a significant part of the expression of individual buildings and in their totality affect the overall quality of the built environment. 
    3.1. Massing. Architectural massing standards are intended to create variation and interest in the positioning of buildings within the prescribed restrictions for heights, setbacks and distances. Building mass should reinforce the importance of the street. 
3.1.1. Building Heights. Building height refers to the vertical distance from the average finished grade of the adjacent ground to the top of the structure, at the highest roof beams of a flat roof, the deck of a mansard roof or the mean level of the highest gable or slope of a hip roof. Maximum building heights are summarized in Schedule C., Zoning District Development Standards and are described in more particularity in the zoning district regulations contained in Article III., Part 3.0., Base or Underlying Zoning Districts and Part 4.0., Overlay Zoning Districts. This maximum might be exceeded by up to fifteen (15) feet in order to accommodate unoccupied, hierarchical architectural structures which might include aesthetic features such as cupolas or infrastructural elements such as camouflaged telecommunication antenna. 

Height is measured from adjacent average finished grade to the highest point on the building.
Design standards: 
 Allowable maximum building heights vary by zoning districts and occasionally by land use classifications. The maximum allowable building height within higher intensity residential multi-family districts is one hundred (100) feet or eight (8) stories but may be higher it mixed use zoning districts. Within non-residential zoning districts, the most intensive zoning district allows a maximum building height of seventy-five (75) feet. Maximum building heights may exceed seventy-five (75) feet within that area designated in the Comprehensive Plan as Transit Oriented Corridors. 
 The allowable maximum height of parking lot light poles is twenty-five (25) feet. 
Design guidelines: 
 New development shall be scaled to conform to existing development by stepping down building heights in order to promote greater neighborhood compatibility. 
 When building heights exceed five (5) stories, it is recommended that the vertical plane is moderated by introducing a horizontal dimension. This may be done by creating step-backs along the building façade. These horizontal moderators are especially important along two (2) to four (4) lane streets in order to create the illusion of fragmented building mass. 
 The step-back transition may be achieved by adding a balcony or terrace on the sixth level. Plants and soft landscape elements should be introduced along this transitional line in order to create visual interest. These step-backs should serve as outdoor living spaces that provide a more humanistic aspect to tall, uniform structures. 

A 15' step-back on a building higher than 5 stories.
3.1.2. Setbacks. Building setbacks are required in all zoning districts although minimum build to lines may be established within the State Road 7 Community Redevelopment Area. LDR Article III., Part 2.0., Section 2.5 establishes a list of structures and features that are allowed within the building setbacks: 

Sidewalks, street trees and signage are all approved features for setbacks.
    3.2. Façade treatment and materials. Buildings should relate to the streets in a manner that enhances and strengthens pedestrian activity. Street-level architectural development should be scaled to the pedestrian and should be attractive and inviting. 
The prevailing character of the design is generally found in the elevation of the building, with the use of molding, quoins and fretwork. They come together to form what is the façade of the project. Successful designs are typically strong and simple, with clear intent and detail treatment. A colonnade or veranda is consistent with this tropical vernacular and assists in identifying a strong entrance. 
Design standards: 
 All building elevations are required to have at least three (3) different material applications for visual interest. 
 Façades shall impart traditional themes of colonial architecture. Setbacks or protrusions in the façade can give visual relief. Brick coursework should have some detail and depth, or should use traditional methods that enhance elevations and frame fenestration and door openings. 
 Materials for façade shall be of stucco (smooth or textured): hardboard, brick, zinc, precast concrete or other suitable material that is appropriate to the Florida tropical theme and the South Florida climate. Detailed molding around fenestration and door openings is recommended. The use of decorative railing of ornate lines and themes is strongly encouraged along flat roof parapets or along large linear expenses of the façade. Small or broken shed roofs accents or awnings are also encouraged along a blank façade. Simulated or non-architectural stonework, such as applied river stone or scored brick face is not permitted. 
 New construction shall have the maximum amount of transparent window area on the street front elevations or a percentage relative to the square footage of the building wall in which it is contained as determined by development review. A minimum of forty (40) percent opening is required. 
 Storefront offices in structures originally designed for retail should be maintained or restored to its original configuration, as long as that is consistent with the City's design theme. 
 Infill storefront design shall be compatible with these design standards for architecture of this building type in the area. Details and architectural features should relate to the entire building or block. A design theme consistent with the tropical environment is expected to be employed at the time of renovation, addition or update. 
 Roll down gates, security shutters and bars are not permitted without approval from the Planning and Zoning Board. Iron work or shutters shall be of design vernacular or design elements that conceal the primary use of the element as security. 
 Storm shutters may be deployed upon the issuance of a storm warning from the governing agency authorized to issue such warning. 
 Columns and posts are recommended as the perimeter support element for the covered entrances, verandas, and walkway areas. A series of columns in wood, steel or concrete, with arches or beams are strong elements in creating scale and passive barrier. 
 Surface treatment shall include ceramic tile with designed patterns and strong colors, crests, textured stucco finishes, and painting techniques employed to provide character accents. Repetition in accent elements along a façade or wall is encouraged as a simple way to tie a design together, provide a strong base and establish a datum line at the user scale. 
 Lighting fixtures shall be of materials, design, colors and image as provided for by the tropical design. Wall washers or accent lighting shall be direct or indirect, designed to eliminate hot spots. 

Building façades should have a variety of materials and color.
Design guidelines: 
 Façade elements such as materials, textures, columns, openings, signs and overhangs should be designed in a manner that clearly articulates the building frontage. In addition, façades should be modulated in order to create visual interest and encourage thematic design. Traditional elements such as colonnades, setbacks or protrusions should be used in order to provide visual relief along building frontages. 
 Street-level façades should provide entry and exit ways at suitable intervals of no more than fifty (50) feet apart. Appropriate landscaping should also be incorporated in order to provide additional texture and color in a manner that does not block views and openings. 

Large expanses of glass should be broken up and roof edges should be clearly demarcated with cornices or other elements.
 Roof lines and edges should be clearly demarcated with the use of terminating elements such as decorative railings, cornices or other visual trims. Roof accents are especially encouraged along blank façades in order to provide interest both in the vertical and horizontal dimension. 
 Façade materials should be of good quality and should meet established standards. Innovative, energy saving, high quality building materials are encouraged. Materials should vary in texture and type to accent windows, entrances and corners. Contrasting materials are encouraged and should create interest when carefully integrated. Materials should be changed in order to articulate building elements such as base, body, cornice, rooflines, parapets and arcades. Materials such as stucco, brick and certain metals that are appropriate to the South Florida climate should be utilized. 
 Fretwork may be introduced here also: the use of cut-outs to create a positive-negative relationship between the open area and the surface beyond is typically successful to accent a specific element type or theme. 
 Gable end windows or vents, and truss detail are design opportunities to emphasize the vernacular components, and are encouraged to be utilized again over entrances or elements of hierarchy. 
 The use of trellis work and lattice work as entry elements, gathering space shelters and wall accents are encouraged. The environment relies on these elements for visual filtering as well. 
    3.3. Architectural fenestrations. To compliment pedestrian scale activity along major corridors, ground floor façades facing streets should include transparent doors and windows. Buildings should also feature architectural detailing in accordance with the South Florida tropical aesthetic. These details will help enliven the streetscape and create a pedestrian-friendly environment. 
3.3.1. Windows. The treatment of windows is critical in defining the architectural form of buildings. The original needs were more for ventilation and visual comfort; due to the advent of air conditioned spaces, they are typically decorative and for natural lighting purposes. However, the use of operable windows with maximum opening is encouraged in multi-family residential employment. Some consideration shall be given to window styles and treatments for privacy and character. 
Design standards: 
 Windows should have muntins and mullions with well-defined frames, transoms and sills. The windows should be framed with shutters, awnings or iron work where appropriate. Minimal tinting to meet energy code requirements may be permitted. Fretwork can also be employed above some window transom designs. 
 Storefront glass shall be clear and the interior view of the store unobstructed from signs, counters, display racks and merchandise. Some articulation of the perimeter of the storefront will be allowed. 
 Windows must be placed on elevations that face the public right-of-way, and must be in scale and compatible with the architectural style of the surrounding buildings. The bottom of the window (knee wall) shall be twenty-four (24) inches typical or may be as low as possible or six (6) inches from slab or sidewalk. The use of full height windows is acceptable in the appropriate environment. 
 Large expanses of wall without window or detail that face the public right-of-way are prohibited. Again some form of perimeter treatment is required and the use of large glazed windows that fold back to full open, with the use of parliament type hinges (one hundred eighty (180) degree swing) or stays, are required. Retail buildings should have fenestration that reveals interior activity, that encourages interest in the products or services provided at the store and illuminates the frontage with indirect lighting at night. 
 Some utilization of the "cooler boxes" or "window chillers" may be appropriate and the employment of the window balcony is open for consideration if they are used appropriately and consistent with the design vernacular. 
 Mirrored glazing or very dark shading on windows shall not be allowed. 
Design guidelines: 
 Transparent windows must take up a minimum of forty (40) percent of the building face at the street level, limiting expanses of solid walls along streets. Reflective surfaces must be avoided so pedestrians may view interior activities. 
 Windows shall be vertical in proportion with consistent and proportionate articulation. 
 Full height windows should generally be avoided unless they compromise the integrity of the architectural character. 

Façades can be modulated by creating varying window sizes and design.
 Areas with large glazed surfaces should feature additional articulation to provide sufficient architectural detail, to create human scale and to provide shading on the sides of the building with the highest rate of heat gain. Clear glazing with Low E coatings (for heat gain) are strongly preferred to reflective surfaces. 
 Windows or louvers at parking structures where exposed to side streets should be proportioned similar to the rest of the structure and be aesthetically treated. 
3.3.2. Doors. The standards governing the design and placement of windows, also applies to doors. 
Design standards: 
 Doors should have muntins and mullions with well-defined frames, transoms and sills. The doors should be framed with sidelights, shutters, awnings, or iron work where appropriate. Reflective or mirrored glass is not permitted. Minimal tinting to meet energy code requirements may be permitted. Fretwork can also be employed above and along the side of some doors and in transom designs. 
 Storefront glass doors shall be clear and the interior view of the store unobstructed from signs, display info and merchandise. Some articulation of the perimeter of the storefront door consistent with the overall design of the theme of character specific to the business shall be allowed. 
 Doors must be placed on elevations that face the public right-of-way, and must be in scale and compatible with the architectural style of the building and surrounding buildings and this design guide. The bottom panel of the door may not be higher than twelve (12) inches above the floor or sidewalk. The use of full height doors is acceptable in the appropriate environment. 
 Large expanses of wall without doors or detail that face the public right-of-way are prohibited. Again some form of perimeter treatment is required and the use of large glazed doors that fold back to full open, with the use of parliament type hinges one hundred eighty (180) degree swing or stays, are welcomed. Retail buildings should have openings that reveal interior activity, that encourage interest in the products or services provided at the store, and illuminate the frontage with indirect lighting at night. 
Design guidelines: 
 The use of fully operable doors with parliament hinges and stays are encouraged and represent a strong character presence for entrance identification and access with maximum opening. It is also encouraged in the residential employment. Some consideration shall be given to colonial styles and treatments for privacy and character. 
    3.4. Gates and entrances. The designation of gateway points and entrances is important in defining a hierarchy of circulation through an open space or in providing a clear path of entry to a building. Entrances are fresh with lively character and are based on spatial lightness with refinement of detail and ornament. They are typically central with symmetrical treatments, identifying them as nodes of arrival. 

Entrances should have high visibility.
Design standards: 
 Buildings shall have hierarchal architectural features such as porches or roof overhangs that delineate or emphasize entrances. This entrance shall face the public right-of-way, be well defined architecturally and readily visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic and may identify a nodal point. 
 The doors should have some detail and may be defined with sidelights or wooden or metal decorative shutters, and may have decorative transoms above that use molding, pediments, keystones or fretwork. The use of full glass panels, half glass and half louver and full louvers is an option to add a special character detail. 
 Porches and overhangs should encourage pedestrian movement and activity, while providing continuous shelter from the sun and rain. Some gathering or nodal points are encouraged to mark a location and rest sports, i.e. patios and or courtyards. The mixing of materials, textures and colors and encouraged to identify the various zones within the pedestrian movement process. Fretwork is again an option that may be employed along the top edge post and beam around the perimeter of the porch overhang. 
 Porch railings should have decorative detailed elements in wood or metal. The post may have a ball type cap or some other specific design. The rails may consist of boards and metal work in a designed shape or form that is repetitious in nature. 
 Gate elements shall be designed to include posts, columns, brackets, lattice work, trellis work, and accent lighting. Gates shall be made of metal, wood, precast concrete, brick, or other approved materials. Fountains shall be of coral rock with continuous water flow and vegetation consistent with the lush tropical design. 
 Entrance features may include town scale clocks, bell towers and gazebos. 
Design guidelines: 
 Entrances should be designed to create smooth transitions between exterior and interior spaces. 
 Entrances should be highly visible to pedestrian and vehicular traffic and be placed at significant nodes of arrival such as sidewalk intersections and crosswalk access points. 
Entrances should have high visibility and should be well articulated.  
 Entrances should have adequate detail and should utilize a mix of materials to create variety and interest. Where space is available, the use of arches or other decorative framing elements should be used in order to create a sense of arrival. Although entrances should be emphasized through unique design, they should conform to and compliment the overall architectural character. 
 The use of a gallery or courtyard for exterior to interior and interior to interior spatial transition is encouraged, as is prevalent in many tropical design approaches. 
    3.5. Arcades and canopies. Arcades should be located where pedestrian circulation along building frontage is important, typically commercial and retail districts with a high pedestrian volume. Arcades may be used as spaces for outdoor dining and gathering. Arcades should be provided where human comfort and protection is desired. 

Arcades should be wide enough to promote efficient circulation.
Design standards: 
 All new development and any amendments made to existing developments that support pedestrian circulation are to provide arcades along the building frontage. 
 Arcades should also include ceiling fans or other devices to induce air movement. 
 Awnings shall only be used where architecturally compatible with the building. The shape of the awning and related hardware should be consistent with the architecture of the building as well as proportional with the scale of the façade and its surroundings. 
 Canopies should in no way interfere with street light fixtures or with the growth and maintenance of street trees, signature trees and landscape materials. 
 Canopies are to be employed in entrances, courtyards, breezeways or connections between buildings. The forms' image or profile shall be consistent with the pitch of "roof" type elements. Canopies are typically hierarchical and a good opportunity for color, detailing embellishments and material enhanced definition. 
 Awnings shall be the same throughout the entire building regarding design, materials, color, and scale. 

Canopies should be unobtrusive and should maintain architectural integrity.
 Where a single building has several storefronts and tenants, or within a single center, they shall have a consistent design, scale, color scheme, and materials throughout. A rational system or differential rhythm may be employed in developing a design character; design sketches shall be submitted for review. 
 Awning fabric shall be made of non-glossy material, such as treated cotton for durability and colorfast material subject to fire department approval. 
 Ribbing (seams) should run vertically. Metal awnings are prohibited. Bahamas type shutters may be used where appropriate. Corrugated metal roofing on awnings, sometimes called windows sheds, shall be allowed. 
 Awning frames should be supported from the underside of the awning to the building with angle braces and, where necessary, use vertical steel support or columns, including part of the primary entrance element. 
 Awnings should not be backlit or contain any signage. Simple down lighting to illuminate the awning, window, door or sidewalk should be used. The awning may be used as an accent device to highlight the tropical theme, character and identity. 
Design guidelines: 
 Arcades should be wide enough to accommodate two-way circulation and standing space. A minimum of fourteen (14) feet is recommended. 
 Arcades should run the entire length of the building frontage, providing a continuous, covered pedestrian corridor. 
 Canopies should have a minimum depth of five (5) feet. 
 Continuous architectural arcades and canopies should reflect the design integrity of the structure. 
    3.6. Rooftops. Rooftops serve as a unique opportunity to maximize floor area use within a building footprint. Where possible, rooftops must be designed to utilize the surface area for various forms of activities. Roofs are strong architectural elements. They provide cover and supply a strong sense of place to accentuate and identify entrances with architectural hierarchy. 
Design standards: 
 Roof surfaces that are not allocated to activity shall be finished with materials and textures in conformity to the architecture of the building. 
 All flat roofs shall have parapets to articulate structural design and to screen roof mounted equipment. 
 All infrastructures within a rooftop will be designed as an integral part of the building volume. 
  Types: Rooflines are generally characterized as pitched with gable ends, hip punctuated with dormers, with windows or ventilation louvers that add detail and interest to the roofline, as well as shed roofs. The vernacular also calls for double gable or hips with a valley gutter. Some use of flat or built-up roofs are necessary in commercial or multi-family the façades to provide required image or character. Variation in roof heights and angles are required for new construction or for major aesthetic changes to an existing building, to add visual interest and delineation of activity within a structure. A minimum slope of 6:12 is required. 
  Materials: The finished roofing material for pitched roofs shall be metal standing seam, flat concrete tile, corrugated metal or Mediterranean type S-tiles; for flat roofs a built-up system may be utilized. 
  Fascia: The fascias around the eaves shall have limited simple detail molding that accentuates the fenestration, porch overhangs or entrances. Some fretwork type fascias are encouraged and design must be approved by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). Example: Roofline includes dormers to vary heights and angles, S-tile and metal seam roofing material and simple detail molding along fascia. 
  Fascia option: Exposed rafters with simple detailed ends may be substituted for fascia type arrangements. Some design character may be added to incorporate the support of gutters and signs. 

Shade structures are roof shade structures.
  Roof overhangs: Roof overhangs must provide continuous cover from sun and rain and be pedestrian friendly. A covered walkway eight (8) foot deep is ideal for the pedestrian circulation. Deeper overhangs are within the tropical vernacular; in most cases thirty (30) inches minimum roof overhang is required. 
  Gable ends: Gable ends are to be treated with large scale fretwork design. Back lighting is encouraged. 
Design guidelines: 
 Acceptable rooftop activities include sun decks, roof gardens, tennis courts, outdoor cafes, pool decks and parking areas. 

Rooftops may be made functional by the addition of landscape to help cool and insulate.
 In instances where rooftops are utilized for parking, the perimeter of the lot should include a trellis, canopy or screen landscaping in order to minimize undesirable views and to create buffers. 
    3.7. Corners. Corner structures play an important role in creating identity within a block and may become significant landmarks. These structures should be emphasized by prominent entrances or small plazas and gathering spaces along their frontages. Creating clearly delineated street corners will add to the overall unique character of Lauderhill. 

Street corners should be well defined.
    3.8. Renovations and additions. The actions taken in this process may differ depending on the condition of the existing structure. If the property has been identified to be listed in the Historic Register, their criteria for treatment must be followed. In typical cases, at a minimum, "before and after" photographs or renderings of each façade and details shall be taken, signed, dated and submitted with the Planning and Zoning (P&Z) applications. Care shall be taken to ensure the appropriateness of the design to the existing building. 
Design standards: 
 Renovations and additions to existing structures shall be compatible with the City of Lauderhill Design Standards, regarding scale, massing, materials and architectural design bearing some correlation to the existing openings patterns, rhythm and roofline. The primary elevations of the façade shall be reconstructed, employing the tropical architectural style and character of similar building in this thematic environment. All additions and new design to an existing structure must comply with the City of Lauderhill Design Standards. 
 Wood, metal, stone and brick veneers of previous renovations shall be removed and the original building surface restored where appropriate. Features such as patio enclosures, sheds, inactive mechanical equipment and related conduit, and blocked up windows shall be removed to restore the original, where appropriate. 
 A change of use to an existing structure shall pursue element modifications and alterations to entrances, canopies, awnings, paint and signage. New openings may be utilized to update the façade to meet the utilitarian needs as well as the City of Lauderhill Design Standards, but may be limited to secondary façades or even avoided. 
 Building renovation projects shall encompass the entire structure, including those areas not visible from the public right-of-way. The use of the City of Lauderhill Design Standards shall be mandatory and employed in redesigning the building to meet the intended architectural character and is subject to the City's design review for approval. 
 Accessibility alterations in order to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements shall be executed in a manner that is compatible with the City of Lauderhill Design Standards and have minimal impact on the original architecture of the building. Covers and canopies shall be employed to provide the additional coverage that may be required due to adverse weather. 
 Building surface material shall be compatible with the South Florida region. Materials such as synthetics, exposed wood, coral or other material suitable to a southern climate intended as façade material shall be treated for exterior use and utilized, if present, or updated. 
 Rehabilitation of existing storefronts shall include restoration and replacement of original architectural features, where appropriate, and the inclusion of architecturally correct elements as recommended by the City of Lauderhill Design Standards. 
 Storefronts within a building, new construction or redevelopment, are to be uniform and contained within structural bays of the building. Uniformity can be achieved by a combination of accents that enhance the façade element or roof forms and types to create the desired amalgamation of images. The tropical character shall be consistent with the City of Lauderhill Design Standards. 
 Individual storefront windows shall not be filled in. In those cases they have been covered windows from previous construction, the original storefront shall be replaced upon renovation with fenestration treatment that forms the ordered vignette prevalent in tropical design. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 4, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 4. - Street level standards. 
    The street level standards focus on the creation of a vibrant urban environment. An appropriate mix of uses and elements at the street level, in conjunction with effective design practices combine to produce a pedestrian-friendly and interactive City. 
    4.1. Fences, walls and privacy gates. Fences and walls within the City of Lauderhill may be useful in the creation of views, as well as, screening undesirable views, separating land uses and establishing physical barriers between different spaces. 
Design standards: 
 Wall height must not exceed eight (8) feet, except as provided for in LDR Article III., Part 5.0., Section 5.18. 
 Walls which face pedestrian spaces must introduce a minimum five (5) foot wide strip of landscaping between the wall and the pedestrian space to soften the appearance. This landscape strip must be planted with groundcover or shrubs; sod is not an acceptable material. 
 Fences, walls and gates are to comply with requirements outlined in relevant sections of the applicable Florida Building Code. A unique design may be submitted for review, if the project warrants the concept and is consistent with the City of Lauderhill Design Standards requirements or the interpretation thereof of the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). 
 Exterior walls shall be painted with a color approved by the City of Lauderhill. See Appendix B-Color Palette of the City of Lauderhill Design Standards. Painting techniques that install instant patina may be considered if a long-term maintenance program is adopted and a letter of the owners' commitment is submitted along with the color request for approval. 
 Blank walls are not permitted and shall be embellished with windows or architectural elements. Elements may include accept tiles, crests, painted forms or murals that celebrate the tropical theme and concepts of repetition and rhythm, or tropical vegetation on figure ground format. All murals must be submitted for preapproval along with the color scheme application, and is subject to final approval from the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ). 
 Walls shall be constructed only in non-residential zones, and shall be determined necessary for protection and security of the property and the community at large. Walls in residential areas are to be discouraged, as they break the continuity of the green belt and reduce the air circulation around the said property. In residential areas, walls are only permitted along the community perimeter or land use transition. 
Design guidelines: 
 Walls for screening should not be obtrusive and their heights and proximity to the use area should not be imposing. 

Fences can be used to separate uses but maintain visual continuity.
    4.2. Plazas. Plazas are integral to the success of a retail, office or residential development due to their ability to provide opportunities for public congregation, interaction and recreation. They also allow for integration between architecture and landscape by incorporating hardscape, structural and decorative elements. Large expanses of building blocks and parking lots should be interrupted by open space plazas for pedestrian comfort and refuge. 

Plaza design should enhance social interaction.
Design standards: 
 Any new development intended to support pedestrian activity should include plaza space. 
 Plazas should abut public areas and be physically and visually accessible from the public sidewalks. Security fences, walls, and entry gates should not block the sidewalk edge of the plaza or views into the plaza. 
 Plazas should be accessible to the public during business hours. 
 Entries to the plaza, business and storefronts within the plaza shall be designed and lighted so they are safe and visible to plaza guest, avoiding hiding places. 
 Plazas shall provide at least one (1) sitting place for each one hundred (100) square feet of plaza in addition to any permitted outdoor dining provided. 
 Plazas should have adequate mix of sun versus shaded area. No more than forty (40) percent of the plaza shall be covered with a roof. 
 At least twenty (20) percent of the plaza's surface shall be landscaped to provide heat relief. 
 Vehicular access, loading, or parking within the plaza is prohibited. Emergency access drives will be considered through plaza upon review of integration into plaza design. 
 Plazas shall be a minimum of two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet. 
 Easy and direct access should be provided for the elderly, disabled and young children and appropriately located and designed lighting should enhance the safety of the plaza. All plazas must meet ADA standards for accessibility. 
 All plazas should be designed with materials that are compatible with the architecture and those that promote continuity throughout the City. Paving materials should reflect the scale of the plaza as well as provide visual keys to changes in use, elevation and circulation. 
 The creation of courtyards or exterior arrival and gathering points are strong vernacular elements of spatial sequence that impart the tropical experience. The employment of courtyards as transitional spaces from exterior to interior and interior to enclosed exterior emphasizes the tropical concept of bringing the outside into the building. 

Plazas should be well shaded to create a comfortable environment.
Design guidelines: 
 Plazas should be designed such that they provide connections among adjacent uses, link parks and greenways and provide a sense of overall continuity within the City of Lauderhill. 
 Plaza edges should be defined and maintained by the use of architectural features (arcades), site furnishings (benches, bollards) and landscape elements depending upon the areas that they connect. 
 Plazas should be designed with good street-to-plaza visibility in order to announce the internal activities, while simultaneously increasing safety by allowing users to be able to watch street activity. 
 Civic spaces should be designed to support various types of special events. Streets and adjacent plazas should be designed as temporary performance areas for special events, festivals and gatherings. A public amphitheater or small stage, where appropriate, should be incorporated into plaza design to encourage activities such as exhibitors, musicians, festivals, farmer's markets, folk dancers or public meetings. 
 Where scale permits, water features should be introduced in order to enhance character and soften hardscape. 
    4.3. Water features. The use of water in a variety of forms is highly encouraged within the City of Lauderhill. Fountains add valuable accents to any setting and provide a sense of relaxation to the urban environment which allows for an improved enjoyment of the sub-tropical South Florida climate. They can mask noise, direct attention, cool small areas and create a soothing atmosphere. 
Design standards: 
 Water features shall avoid interference with circulation. 
 Durable, solid materials should be used for containment. The color and materials used in and around fountains should be compatible with other streetscape and plaza elements. 
 Wind regulators shall be used to minimize water spray on users and adjacent paving. 
 Water feature mechanical equipment shall be remote and shall not obstruct pedestrian areas. All water features must comply with all local codes and regulations. 
Design guidelines: 
 Interactive fountains are encouraged in mixed-use areas to impart vibrancy and character. 
 Nighttime lighting is strongly recommended near water features to add visual appeal and added security. 
 A variety of effects are encouraged for fountain design, such as bubbles, sprays, falls, mists, pools and basins. 
Water features can be focal and sculptural elements providing variety and interest.  
    4.4. Public art. Public art reflects the attitude and character of the community towards culture. Establishing public art throughout the City of Lauderhill will help to create space and identity, as well as, to celebrate the eclectic community of residents. 
Design standards: 
 All art pieces, whether sculptures, mosaics or frescoes, should be durable and free of sharp or obtrusive objects. 
 All artwork must be reviewed and approved by a public art committee, established by the City, in order to ensure its universal appeal and applicability. 
 Art work should not be offensive or disrespectful. 

Sculptures lend character and infuse identity into spaces.

Interactive public art encourages community interaction.
    4.5. Paving and materials. Paving becomes an important element within the urban environment in creating space on the ground plane and establishing identity within the City. 
Design standards: 
 Special paving, including stamped asphalt, should be utilized on all major intersections, pedestrian crosswalks, sidewalks, plazas and bus stops. 
 Paving materials at streetscape intersections and sidewalks should reflect the intensity of pedestrian traffic and create identifiable ground plane links throughout the City. 
 Paving color and textures shall utilize a tropical blend to reflect the South Florida aesthetic. 
 Paving materials should also reflect more solar energy than traditional paving materials in order to reduce the overall heat index. 
 The use of open grid pavement systems, such as unit pavers, is strongly encouraged for any pedestrian hardscape area in order to decrease storm water runoff. 

Paving design should represent the South Florida tropical aesthetic.
Design guidelines: 
 Pedestrian paving can define uses along the streetscapes. By varying the appearance of the surface materials, distinctions can be made between public sidewalks and private outdoor areas. 
 Well marked sidewalks with special paving will also aid in the overall circulation system. 

Changes in paving materials define different use areas.
    4.6. Sidewalks and pedestrian routes. Pedestrian circulation is one of the most important aspects of the City. Sidewalks should connect major points within the City as well as connect the City to the surrounding neighborhoods. 

Building blocks should be broken up by small-scale pedestrian spaces.
Design standards: 
 The pavement system should be easily negotiated by all sidewalk users. It should not present any unnecessary obstructions and all sidewalks must be wheelchair accessible. 
 Adequate shade and shelter must be provided to protect pedestrians from inclement weather. 
 Sidewalks should not be composed of materials that might be dangerous or uncomfortable under any conditions. 
 Sidewalks must be safely separated from vehicular circulation routes by provision of a curb and/or landscape treatment. 
 Minimum sidewalk width must be five (5) feet in all neighborhoods and commercial areas. 
 The attitude of tropical design in an urban setting encourages the shift of the building back towards the street side, while relocating the parking to the rear of the complex. This reverts the hierarchal component back to the pedestrian community. A paved pedestrian walk or colonnade to provide cover and intermittent landscaping would be the end solution. 

Streetscapes should include desirable elements such as planters, shade structures, site furniture and interesting paving patterns.
    4.7. Bikeways. 
Design standards: 
 Bike lanes must meet all local transportation and State regulations. 
 Bikeway lanes should be properly located along neighborhood streets leading to major corridors. 
 Areas that are designated for bicyclists must use paving materials that are smooth and free of obstruction. 
 There must be a clearly designated separation between bicycle zones and vehicular areas. This separation can be visually established by using varying colors or materials where possible. 
 Proposed development must provide a minimum of two (2) bike racks (four (4) feet to six (6) feet length) 

Bike routes should be clearly marked and should include bike racks at appropriate locations.
Design guidelines: 
 Roadway surfaces must be designed to accommodate bicyclists and should connect to the surrounding bicycle systems and link the neighborhoods to parks, open spaces, schools, libraries, and civic buildings within the area. 
 Bike racks should be located at various locations throughout the City to provide safe and convenient temporary storage. Bike racks should be covered to protect bicycles and riders from inclement weather. 
    4.8. Utilities and loading areas. 
Design standards: 
 All building facilities for loading, trash and service should be located within the structure of the building. 
 These areas shall be completely enclosed and shall be screened with a decorative wall or fence. Screen landscape plants should also be incorporated. 
 Where trash/loading areas are visible from the street, they are to be gated with solid panels. All trash/utility/loading areas must allow for access by garbage maintenance vehicles. 
    4.9. Bus stops. The concept of the bus stop is simply that it provides shelter from sun, wind and rain, while allowing for three hundred sixty (360) degree visibility and security. The materials shall be durable and low maintenance. Standard design elements such as the roof form, construction details and colors indicate the tropical theme. 
Design standards: 
 The strongest single characteristic is the roof, its pitch, material and color. Utilization of a deep overhang and generous roof slope assists in protecting the user and representing the desired image. The standing metal seam roof is the material of choice. 
 The bus stop shall be further articulated with metal or concrete posts, or columns with angle braces and benches which shall be exterior grade finished bench furniture with possible enhancements of wood cladding or accents. The finishes shall be coatings that remain cool to the touch. 
 The bus stop shall be well lighted (tamper proof) or located within eight (8) feet of existing street light. 
 The stop's side enclosure panels shall be translucent in character and attached in such detail as to allow air circulation within the sheltered area. This is a great moment to employ the use of lattice-work as portions of the enclosure. 
 Site landscaping shall be included to provide sun shade for the bus stop and its users. 
 The primary colors that are part of the recommended palette shall be utilized. 
Design guidelines: 
 Efforts should be made to retain storm water on site as far as possible to reduce run off. 
 Rainwater harvesting should also be encouraged through the collection of water from roofs with large cisterns or rain barrels which can be subsequently used for irrigation. 
 Wastewater shall be reused as much as possible for landscape irrigation. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 5, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 5. - Landscape and irrigation standards. 
    In order to establish a strong image for the City of Lauderhill, all landscape treatments should be bold, layered and consistent, therefore contributing to the tropical feel of the region. Plantings should provide a common framework and be governed by both the aesthetic qualities of the varying materials and the functional concerns of different areas within the City. In addition, there should be a consideration towards preserving existing plant material and attempts should be made to utilize native species as much as possible. 
    Landscape plantings will provide important spatial definitions to the City of Lauderhill. They will aid in establishing a strong identity for the City while visually unifying its streets, sidewalks, medians, open spaces and yards. Full and healthy plantings will also help mitigate the South Florida climate and will create year round habitable spaces. Plantings also help in the screening of unsightly views of parking garages and lots, exposed utility areas and loading zones. Proper use of landscape plantings will also aid in directing pedestrian traffic through the City. 
    5.1. Purpose. The intent of these regulations is to protect, preserve, and enhance the natural environment and the beauty of the City. It will provide landscape for green spaces, trees and other plants and arranging them in a pleasing manner in relation to paved areas and structures. The planting of native materials is highly desirable and preferred. These objectives are defined in general terms and the realization can only be obtained by proper design and location of trees, shrubs, plants and grass. 
    5.2. Streetscape planting. Streetscape planting will serve two (2) major purposes within the City of Lauderhill namely, the provision of shade along sidewalks and the creation of visual connectivity between different parts of the City. 
Design standards: 
 The location of street trees should provide a strong buffer between vehicular traffic zones and pedestrian zones. 
 Continuous street tree trenches should be encouraged throughout the City to provide soil area for roots to spread and water to penetrate. Trenches should be approximately thirty (30) inches deep and six (6) to eight (8) feet wide running continuously parallel to the curb. Street tree trenches promote a healthier tree canopy which in turn provides more shade and stronger roots systems to fight overturning during storms. 

Street trees should provide shade and separation from vehicular zones.

Street planting should be consistent in spacing and quality.
Design guidelines: 
 A strong tree program should be created along primary and secondary roadways. 
 Street trees should be at a consistent distance from each other and should be of the highest quality. 
 Shade trees should be encouraged in order to create outdoor spaces that are habitable all year. 
    5.3. Buffering and screening. When properly planted, landscaping can be an effective technique to screen utility areas and to protect building elements. Dense planting along parking structures and busy streets can soften edges and buffer noise from habitable areas, such as residential neighborhoods, open spaces, schools etc. Proper placement of understory plantings, coupled with climbing vines, medium shrubs, palms and trees are strongly desired to minimize views. 
Design standards: 
 Situations where screening interferes with function and circulation within spaces must be avoided. For example, when screening cars in a parking lot, allowance must be made for vehicle dimensions such as open door radii and vehicle overhangs. 

Screening should not interfere with function.
The following is a list of plant materials considered acceptable for screening purposes:

Design guidelines: 
 Planting can be introduced to take advantage of cooling breezes as well as to mitigate the effects of major winds. 
 Proper species selection and planting placement can funnel breezes to desired areas. Efforts should be made to identify and locate areas that might detract from the overall visual quality of a space and to effectively screen these through appropriate planting techniques. 
    5.4. Perimeter landscaping. Perimeter landscaping should be used to separate different land uses from one another and to create boundaries between utility zones and other use areas. 
Design standards: 
 Perimeter strips, at a minimum of five (5) feet in width, must be introduced between the abutting property line and any off-street parking areas, except that this standard may be waived if it is zoned under the City's Smartcode. One (1) tree and a hedge or other durable landscape material, must be planted for every thirty-five (35) lineal feet within this strip between a non-residential district and an adjacent residential lot. The Planning and Zoning Director may vary this to avoid conflicts with the visibility of signage. 
    5.5. Parking lot planting. Landscaping is required both within the interior area of a surface parking lot, as well as, along the perimeter of a surface parking lot to soften and screen the parking facility. 
Design standards (which may be waived by the Planning and Zoning Director if within the area subject to the Smartcode): 
 A minimum of fifteen (15) percent of the gross parking area is to be constituted by living landscape, which includes grass, ground cover, plants, shrubs and trees. 
 Every eleventh consecutive parking space, and the end of every parking strip area, must have a landscaped island ten (10) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in depth. 
 Each island shall contain one (1) tree, and grass or ground cover. 
 Two (2) adjoining rows of parking must be separated by a minimum five (5) foot median which should be landscaped with hedge, grass or ground cover and should have one (1) tree for every forty (40) lineal feet. 

Parking areas should appear lush and soft.
    5.6. Irrigation. All vegetation planted within the City of Lauderhill will require irrigation to maintain the lush, tropical aesthetic desired by the community. 
Design standards: 
 All planting and grass areas shall be provided with an automatically operating underground irrigation system. 
 Sizing and spacing of heads and lines shall be specified and installed to provide one hundred (100) percent water coverage, and a minimum fifty (50) percent overlap of all living surface areas. 
 Irrigation systems should be designed to accommodate the specific water requirements of the various planting areas. 
 Distribution should be designed to minimize overspray onto buildings and site structures as well as pedestrian areas. 

Bio-retention cells and rain garden are effective techniques to harvest rainwater. Providing curb cuts with inlet protection areas allows for run-off to be properly channeled.
Other requirements that must be strictly adhered to are enumerated elsewhere in these Land Development Regulations. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 6, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 6. - Signage and graphics standards. 
    Signage and graphics should functionally communicate information while fitting aesthetically into the fabric of the City. The signage and graphics system should be simple and coordinated and contribute towards enhancing the identity of Lauderhill. All signage should compliment other streetscape elements and conform to the requirements listed in LDR Schedule I. 
    In view of the broad range of public users, the design of signs and graphics needs to be flexible. It is essential that signage design have the ability to expand and serve new areas within the City. The City of Lauderhill is committed to providing signage identifying gateways into the City and its various neighborhoods. Approved colors for the main entrance and community identity signage include: Benjamin Moore Paint: Morning Glory 785, Matthews Paint: 46A-3P Mint Hint, Matthews Paint: 26B-1P Gladsome and Matthews Paint: 17A-3P Peach Whisper. Signage serves a variety of purposes and the scale, size and material used should be commensurate with function. 
Design standards: 
 A Master Sign Plan shall be included with any development order application for new construction, redevelopment and substantial improvement or major renovation. Signs shall use the same colors and materials as the building, or may be part of the overall complex signage system developed in the tropical character. 
 Window signs shall be kept to a minimum consistent with Schedule I. 
Design guidelines: 
 Signage shall be clearly legible and simple in form, but reflect the attention to detail that provides relevant information. 
 Figure ground and massing are typical techniques utilized in the tropical communities to achieve a graphic image that is symbolic and suggestive of the intended comment. 
    6.1. Directional signs. To emphasize the character of the City of Lauderhill and the cohesiveness of its various components, a uniform series of signs directing vehicles and pedestrians throughout the area is desirable. Directional signs have three (3) target groups-Motor vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. In areas where walkways/bikeways lie along vehicular routes, the signage for both groups is combined. In areas with separate pedestrian paths and bike routes, separate signage should be provided. 
Design guidelines: 
 The City should consider adopting a Master Directional Signage Plan which would provide a "standard" appearance for such signage, identify the public (e.g., City Hall, library, parks) and major private (e.g., Lauderhill Mall) facilities to be advertised, and the general location of the proposed signage. 
    6.2. Informational signs. These are signs that provide important information such as identifying focal areas, transit stops, public plazas entrances and other nodal areas. Informational signage could also include street identification signs, therefore having a consistent identification standard. 

Information signs identifying nodes and routes.
    6.3. Entry signs. Entry signs are intended to designate points of transition from one (1) area to another. They will be used to announce thresholds into major destinations within the City or indicate the entry into specific development properties. Elements that are approved be incorporated into the entry statement include: special paving, plant material, focal elements, special lighting, banners, signage and water features. 

Entry signs should indicate a sense of arrival.
    6.4. Specialty signs/banners. Specialty banners are intended to advertise special events throughout the City, celebrate holidays and festivals. They are intended to sustain a sense of excitement and change. 

Banners should be colorful and artistic.
Design guidelines: 
 The City should consider adopting a Master Specialty Signage Plan which would provide a separate appearance "standard" for branding important gateway and other roads, such as branding University Drive as "Decor Road." 
 Due to the strength and intensity of the South Florida sun, all banners fabrics should be made from marine canvas or vinyl fabrics or both. These types of fabrics can withstand prolonged exposure to the sun and allow air movement through the banner. 
    6.5. Retail signs. Retail signs announce individual businesses and stores. Such signs should maintain the integrity of building façades and architectural character. Signs should not interfere with door and window openings, conceal architectural details or obscure the composition of the façade where they are located. Sign background colors must be compatible with the colors of the building façade with the exception of trademark and corporate colors. A dull or matte finish is recommended to minimize glare and enhance legibility. Wherever possible, signs located on buildings within the same block face shall be placed at the same height in order to create a unified sign band. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 7, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 7. - Site furnishing standards. 
    Site furnishings play an important role in the overall character and visual quality of the City. Careful consideration must be given to the selection of site furnishing such as benches, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, bicycle racks etc. Coordination of materials and colors, functionality, durability and handicap accessibility are paramount criteria in the selection of appropriate furnishings. Site furniture should be used as a tool for unifying character within various parts of the City. 
    7.1. Recommended materials. Materials for site furnishings should be selected for maximum strength, durability and low maintenance requirements. Surface finishes should weather and age gracefully and should be commensurate with the tropical climate of South Florida. Accents in the form of hardware may require some additional maintenance beyond the recommended minimum. 
Design guidelines: 
 Aluminum/cast aluminum 
 Stainless steel 
 Concrete 
 Granite 
 Keystone 
 Specialty hardwoods 
 Cast iron (finished with epoxy based paint) 
    7.2. Bike racks. Bike racks will provide a safe and secure place for residents and visitors to lock bicycles and participate in recreational and retail activities. 
Design standards: 
 The placement of bike racks must not interfere with pedestrian routes. 
 Racks should be located along sides of buildings, relatively close to entrance doors and should be covered to protect from rain and extreme heat. 
 These racks must be visible, within clear sight lines, both in the daytime and at night. Bike racks should therefore be located in close proximity to light fixtures, to enhance safety. 

Bike racks may also be used as sculptural elements.
Design guidelines: 
 Racks should be architecturally treated as aesthetic site elements and should be designed to have minimum visual impact. 

Bike racks can be basic and functional.
    7.3. Bollards. Bollards should be designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The primary function of the bollard is to discourage vehicular intrusion of pedestrian dominated spaces. 
Design standards: 
 Bollards design and location must consider emergency and maintenance vehicles. 

Bollards can serve both functional and aesthetic purposes.
Design guidelines: 
 Bollard design should relate to adjacent architectural elements and streetscape. 
 The design of bollards should reflect and enhance the City's design theme. 
 Where possible, it is recommended that light bollards be used in order to emphasize pathways and delineated pedestrian areas at night. 
    7.4. Flagpoles/banners. Flagpoles and banners present opportunities for the inclusion of color, pattern and movement within the City. They can be used both as seasonally displayed elements and as permanent information provided to the community. 
Design standards: 
 Flagpoles should be located in odd number groupings to create focal points at portals and major entrances. 
 Flags and banners should also be changed periodically to maintain visual interest in various areas. 

Flags and banners add visual interest to a space.
Design guidelines: 
 Banners may include many items of various shapes such as windsocks and flags. 
 They can be hung from walls, light fixtures or any other structural elements of sufficient strength. 
 Flags or banners should provide information for upcoming events or celebrations. 
    7.5. Benches. Seating in urban spaces is used for social interaction, waiting, resting and people watching. They are to provide a place to stop and enjoy the surroundings. 
Design standards: 
 Benches should be placed outside of the main pedestrian flow, but within close proximity to pedestrian routes. 
 Seating should be placed in shaded open spaces, plazas, parks and bus stops. 
 Benches should be inviting and should encourage and invite longer stays in recreational areas. Benches in such locations should be designed with backs for increased comfort. In areas, such as transit stops, where shorter stays are anticipated, backless benches may be used. 
 Special care should be taken to locate and select benches that discourage overnight sleeping by vagrants. 
 Measures should be taken to ensure that the selected benches are comfortable all year round and are not drastically affected by exposure to intense sunlight. 

Benches should be placed in the shade along pedestrian routes.
Design guidelines: 
 Seating must occur along streetscapes, plazas and open spaces. It should be consistent with other site elements implemented in these areas. 
 Seat walls can sometimes serve as alternatives to benches and should be incorporated to highlight grade changes, separate spaces and aesthetic purposes. 
    7.6. Tree grates. Tree grates are used to expand walkable surface in pedestrian areas while providing adequate canopy cover in order to enhance the overall environment. 
Design standards: 
 Tree grates shall be designed with small openings in order to be walkable, yet porous and moveable for maintenance purposes. 
 Tree grates must have barrier free access for wheelchairs and should adhere to ADA codes and regulations. 
 Tree grates must be compatible in character with other site furnishings in the City of Lauderhill. 

Tree grates increase walkable surface area while allowing for tree planting in plazas.
    7.7. Planters. As special site elements, planters and flower pots can visually enhance a space and provide areas for landscape relief, as well as reduce or accent an architectural mass. Planters define the human scale of spaces, absorb precipitation and help reduce the urban heat island effect. 
Design standards: 
 Planters are a required addition to the frontage of any building supporting pedestrian activity. 
 The installation of free standing planters at seating areas, along edges of parking lots and in pedestrian plazas is required. 

Planters soften edges and provide green relief in urban areas.
Design guidelines: 
 Planters should be designed with consideration to both, the physical form of the planter as well as the plant material used. Where feasible, planters should be clustered with other furnishings. 
 The design of planters should be compatible with other furnishings. 
 Planters should also be used to define primary building entrances. 
 Planters should be spaced to create rhythm or clustered at entry nodes. 
    7.8. Trash receptacles. Trash receptacles are an essential part of an urban community. They are provided for convenience and help to keep spaces clean. 
Design standards: 
 Receptacles shall be located along pedestrian routes and in plazas where they are easily visible and accessible but do not impede circulation and views. Preferable locations include curb edges, in close proximity to plant beds or planters, where they may be easily maintained. 
 Trash receptacles must be waterproof and should be provided with lids. 
 Each receptacle should have a sturdy removable liner for easy maintenance and be sized to accept standard trash bags. 

Trash receptacles should be visible, easily accessible and well maintained.
Design guidelines: 
 Trash receptacles must be consistent in terms of material, color and style with other streetscape elements. They must compliment other furnishings and help unify the image of Lauderhill. 
    7.9. Drinking fountains. Drinking fountains offer refreshment to users in pedestrian areas. When located under shade and near seating areas, they help to create a refreshing oasis in the tropical South Florida climate. 
Design standards: 
 Drinking fountains must be wheelchair accessible and must have self closing control to minimize inefficient or improper water usage. 

Drinking fountains should be installed at varying heights to accommodate different users.
Design guidelines: 
 Drinking fountains can be freestanding or attached to a wall or building surface. 
 They should compliment other site furnishings in the City by incorporating similar materials. 
    7.10. Parking meters. Parking meters are needed for organized and efficient parking areas. They are a necessary regulatory element in the urban environment. 
Design standards: 
 Parking meters shall be provided for public parking spaces. 
 Parking meters must clearly designate the time of operation and cost. 
 Meters shall be uniform in color, material and style to ensure continuity within the City of Lauderhill. 

Electronic group parking meters are preferable to individual meters.
Design guidelines: 
 Individual meters per space are discouraged and modern electronic group meters are encouraged. 
(Ord. No. 10O-02-108, § 8, 2-22-2010) 
Sec. 8. - Lighting standards. 
    A well coordinated lighting system is a very effective way of establishing a sense of security and unity throughout the City of Lauderhill. Although the primary function of site lighting is to provide nighttime orientation and security, light fixtures become visible site elements that contribute significantly to the overall urban character. Light fixtures should therefore be cohesive, with thematic variations consistent between streetscape lighting, pedestrian lighting and any added decorative fixtures. 
    The City of Lauderhill strives to adhere to lighting guidelines established by the International Dark Sky Association (IDA). The guidelines outline ways to preserve and protect the night sky. The IDA recommends light bulbs and fixtures that abide by these standards. The City of Lauderhill urges new development and any amendments to existing development to utilize lighting design that is Dark Sky compliant. 
    Light fixtures must be scaled based on the spaces within which they are being implemented. In general, the larger the scale of the use, the higher the mounting light will be. The size of the fixture should also be in proportion to the height of the pole it is mounted on. Various uses require different types of lighting. 
    Light is measured in foot-candles. This unit measures the intensity of light falling on a surface, equal to one (1) lumen per square foot and originally defined with reference to a standardized candle burning at one (1) foot from a given surface. 
    The following suggested minimum average maintained foot-candle levels should be provided for the City: 
 Intersections 1.0 F.C.  Side streets 0.8 F.C.  Parking lots 1.0 F.C.  Promenade 1.0 F.C.  Sidewalks 0.6 F.C.  Landscape lighting (varies)  
    Several different light sources are available for site lighting, with characteristic advantages and disadvantages to each. The following general standards are included for selection of an appropriate light source. 
 High pressure sodium-Because of its high efficiency and long lamp life, high-pressure sodium should be the predominant light source throughout the City of Lauderhill. It should be used on all streets and parking lots. It should however, be avoided in areas of high pedestrian use because of its poor rendition qualities. 
 Metal halide-Although not as efficient as high-pressure sodium, metal halide is much more pleasant in high pedestrian areas because it illuminates with true colors. It should be considered for large scale gathering spaces such as plazas and major pedestrian routes. 
 Color corrected mercury vapor-Mercury vapor is less efficient than metal halide and should be used only in low voltage situations where efficiency is not critical. It may also be used to accent landscape plant material because of its ability to emphasize green foliage. 
 Compact fluorescent-CFL's give off the same amount of light as incandescent lighting but use less power and have a longer rated life. CFL's may be used in low-level pedestrian scale fixtures at building entries or in small courtyards. 
 L.E.D. lighting-L.E.D. lights are an energy efficient technique to light areas with more diffuse lighting requirements. These lights utilize much less power and provide softer lighting. They are thus effective in highlighting architectural and hardscape elements in the dark, and in providing mellow lighting that can be well incorporated into landscape and plantings. L.E.D. lights also last longer than other lighting types and is thus easier to maintain. L.E.D. lights can be used in signage, building, and landscape accent lighting. 
    8.1. Streetscape lighting. The main objective of streetscape lighting is to provide sufficient illumination for vehicular and pedestrian safety and to improve the aesthetic quality of the City's streets. 
Design guidelines: 
 Lighting should be hierarchical, varying in intensity between major thoroughfares and side streets. 
 Fixtures along streets shall be located approximately one hundred (100) feet on center. 
 All poles shall be located a minimum of four (4) feet from the curb face and maintained plumb and secure. The placement of poles should not create undesirable obstructions in pedestrian ways. Light poles on designated pedestrian routes shall be outfitted for specialty banners. 

Lauderhill street and pedestrian lighting.
    8.2. Pedestrian lighting. Pedestrian lighting within the City of Lauderhill must serve a variety of functions. Not only must the lighting establish a safe and secure atmosphere for nighttime use, it must also provide a distinct ambience, differentiating pedestrian facilities from adjacent vehicular zones. 

Pedestrian lighting should create a positive ambience.
Design standards: 
 The fixtures, poles and bollards must have a human scale and should compliment hardscape and other streetscape elements. 
    8.3. Landscape lighting. In many instances, appropriate light levels and pleasant accent effects may be achieved through the use of landscape lighting. Accent spotlight fixtures provide low intensity but often dramatic illumination of nearby pedestrian areas. 
Design standards: 
 When used, landscape accent lights should be unobtrusive in appearance or hidden from view or both. 
 All landscape lighting should be placed where beams are directed away from pedestrians' vision cones. 
 Lights mounted directly in trees should be discouraged unless means of attaching the fixture and conduit are sensitively handled to protect the plants' health and ensure a pleasing appearance. 

Appropriate lighting can highlight planting and other landscape elements.
Design guidelines: 
 Down lighting, with fixtures attached to free standing poles or neighborhood buildings, is advantageous when more than one (1) tree is to be lit or when a less concentrated effect is desired. 
 Although it is impossible to provide definitive standards regarding the quantity of illumination or exact placement of fixtures, desired effects usually require between one-half (0.5) and one (1) ambient foot-candles, depending on design objectives, color of foliage, surrounding light levels etc. 
    8.4. Materials and colors. Light fixtures are available in many materials and colors. 
Design standards: 
 Cast aluminum or cast bronze is the most durable and aesthetically pleasing material option. 
 Standard box light fixtures are prohibited. 
 Fixture fittings of cast aluminum fixtures should be stainless steel. 
 Poles and bollards for lighting should be aluminum, fiberglass, decorative concrete or cast iron. These poles provide a narrow profile and require little maintenance. Depending on location and thematic considerations, decorative poles may be selected. 
Design guidelines: 
 During daylight hours, lighting fixtures should blend into the landscape and appear well coordinated with other site furnishings. 
 Finishes should preferably be powder coatings that minimize maintenance.

 The Shared Parking Standards Table provides the method for calculating shared parking for buildings with more than on Use type. It refers to the parking requirements that appear in Table 9-a. 
 The parking required for any two Land Uses on a Lot is calculated by dividing the number of spaces required by the lesser of the two uses by an appropriate factor from this Table and adding the result to the greater use parking requirements. 
 For example, for a building with a Residential Use requiring 100 spaces and a Commercial Use requiring 20 spaces, the 20 spaces divided by the sharing factor of 1.2 would reduce the total requirement to 100 plus 16 spaces.

ARTICLE 5. - THOROUGHFARES 

5.1. - APPLICABILITY. 
5.1.1. This Article describes the guidelines for development of Thoroughfares throughout the area designated on the SmartCode Overlay Transect Zone Map. It supplements the Engineering Standards and Procedures for Land Development Activities in Schedule J of these Land Development Regulations. 
5.1.2. The urban landscape is characterized by a set of interdependent elements that help create a sense of place. These include Thoroughfare type, Building type, Frontage type, and the form and disposition of landscaping and lighting. Thoroughfares provide the City with moving lanes for vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians and public Open Space. 
5.1.3. A Thoroughfare is associated with a particular type of movement and is endowed with two (2) attributes: movement and character. The movement type of the Thoroughfare refers to the number of vehicles that can move safely through a segment within a given time period; it is physically manifested by the number of lanes and their width, by the centerline radius, the curb radius, and the super-elevation of the pavement. The character of the Thoroughfare refers to its suitability as a setting for pedestrian activities and it is physically manifested by the associated Frontage types as determined by location within the Transect. 
5.1.4. Thoroughfares can be assigned appropriately to Transect Zones, with calibrated Right-of-Way widths, movement types, design speeds, number of travel lanes, pavement width, curb radius and verge type. 
a.  In Zone T4, generally sidewalks occur at the edge of the Right-of-Way. 
b.  In Zones T5 and T6, sidewalks occur at the edge of the Right-of-Way and are given the additional dimensions of the ten-foot setback in the First Layer as an easement. 
5.1.5. The following assumptions govern the Thoroughfares shown here: 
a.  To clear sight line for drivers, Visibility Triangles shall be required as described in Section 5.6 and specifically Subsection 5.6.3. See Article 4., Table 13. 
b.  Pavement widths are measured inside of curb to inside of curb. 
c.  Curbs and gutters may range from one (1) foot six (6) inches for City Thoroughfares to two (2) feet zero (0) inches for some County Thoroughfares. 
d.  Regular parking space widths range from seven (7) feet zero (0) inches to nine (9) feet zero (0) inches; they should be wider on higher speed Thoroughfares but may be restricted by existing Right-of-Way dimensions. 
e.  Right turns may be taken from the parking lane. 
f.  Tree spacing are twenty-three (23) feet on center to match parallel parking or centered to match Lot Line spacing. 
g.  Tree planters have a minimum dimension of four (4) feet by four (4) feet; increased where possible to a four (4) foot by eight (8) foot dimension. 
h.  Bulb-outs may be added where Thoroughfare widths are wide and design speed high, or where sidewalks are narrow, in order to facilitate pedestrian safety. 
5.1.6. Thoroughfares must evolve with the needs of the area encompassed within the SmartCode Overlay Transect Zone Map. As the above-described area continues to develop and re-develop, a Thoroughfare may change in character reflecting new density or conversely, a return to a historic dimension. For example, a continuous lawn planter may be replaced with individual tree wells for additional sidewalk space or a wide neighborhood street may be narrowed to control traffic intrusion. 
5.1.7. The accommodation of bicycles and transit requires detailed response to the existing Thoroughfare condition and thus is not illustrated here specifically. 
5.2. - GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 
5.2.1. Thoroughfares are intended for use by vehicular, transit, bicycle and pedestrian traffic and to provide access to Lots and Open Spaces. 
5.2.2. Thoroughfares consist of lanes for vehicles, transit, bicycles and Public Frontages. The lanes may have a variety of widths for movement and parking. The Public Frontages contribute to the character of Transect Zones. They may include swales, Sidewalks, curbing, Planters, bicycle paths and street trees. See Article 4, Tables 2, 3, 3A - 3I, 6 and 13. 
5.2.3. Thoroughfares should be designed in context with the urban form and the desired speed of the Transect Zones through which they pass. The Public Frontages that pass from one (1) Transect Zone to another should be adjusted accordingly. 
5.2.4. Bicycles are a sustainable and viable mode of transportation and recreation within the area encompassed by SmartCode Overlay Transect Zone Map. Bicycle use of Thoroughfares should be as follows: Bicycles and vehicles may share use of lanes on all Thoroughfares. Thoroughfares that have sufficient paving width to accommodate bicyclists' safety should included dedicated Bicycle Lanes. Greenways, waterfront walks and other Civic Spaces should include Bicycle usage. 
5.2.5. A bicycle plan may designate an interconnected network serving bicyclists with a series of marked routes that include Bicycle Lanes as well as Bicycle Routes that give bicycles priority, such as those Thoroughfares which parallel major corridors or include major corridors which can be re-configured to limit conflicts between vehicles and bicycles. 
5.2.6. Pedestrian comfort should be a primary consideration of Thoroughfare design and dimensions. Design conflicts between and among vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian movement should be decided in favor of the pedestrian. 
5.3. - THOROUGHFARES. 
5.3.1. This Article establishes the guidelines for Thoroughfares. Typical Thoroughfares are assembled from the Vehicular Lane elements that appear in Article 4, Table 2, 3 and 3A - 3I and the Public Frontages of Article 4, Table 4 and Table 5. Through the Waiver process, additional Thoroughfare assemblies may be proposed on a plat or Site Plan. 
5.3.2. The Thoroughfare network should be designed to prioritize connectivity, defining Blocks not exceeding the maximum block perimeter for the affected Transect zone. The block perimeter shall be measured as the sum of Lot Frontage Lines. Thoroughfare closing shall not be allowed; instead traffic calming designs should be deployed to control traffic volume and speeding. Notwithstanding, Thoroughfare closings may be deployed to discourage access to certain institutional/Civic uses (e.g., community blood banks) in order to protect the general health, safety and welfare. 
5.3.3. All Thoroughfares should terminate at other Thoroughfares to form a network. Cul-de-sacs should be allowed only when supported by natural site conditions. Thoroughfares that provide View Corridors shall not be vacated. 
5.3.4. In T5 and T6 Zones, Public and Private Frontages should be coordinated with a single paving and landscape design as provided in Article 4, Tables 4, 5, and 6. 
5.4. - CONNECTIONS PLAN MAP. 
5.4.1. In Palm Beach County v. Wright, 641 So.2d 50 (Fla. SCt 1994), the Florida Supreme Court approved the validity of a Thoroughfare Map designating for planning purposes roads that are likely to be widened and future roads that are to be built. Like the Palm Beach County Thoroughfare Map, the Connections Plan Map referenced herein is intended to: 
a.  Protect existing and future Rights-of-Way (including Pedestrian Passages) from building encroachments and to preserve and acquire existing and future Rights-of-Way; 
b.  Place property owners on notice as to the necessity and location of future Thoroughfares; and 
c.  Allow land developers adequate time to plan their developments with proper Thoroughfare interfacing requirements. 
5.4.2. The Connections Plan Map is displayed in Map Number 2 and shows the general locations for Thoroughfares (including Pedestrian Passages) consistent with the standards, requirements and guidelines established herein. The exact Thoroughfare locations, Thoroughfare types and widths have not been finally determined and shall be determined on a case-by-case basis so as to allow flexibility to ameliorate any hardships. 
5.4.3. The City may require the dedication of Easements and Rights-of-Way in order to implement the Connections Plan Map. The City may allow a Thoroughfare to be initially developed as a private driveway and when circumstances are appropriate to be converted into a public Right-of-Way. 
5.5. - PUBLIC FRONTAGES. 
5.5.1. Public Frontage should be designed as shown in Article 4, Tables 4 and 5 and allocated within Transect Zones as specified in Article 4, Table 11. 
5.5.2. Within the Public Frontages, the arrangement of street trees and street lights should be as provided in Article 4, Tables 4 and 5. 
5.5.3. The Public Frontage in Transect Zones T4, T5, T6 should include trees planted in a regularly spaced Allée of single or alternated species with shade canopies of a height that, at maturity, clears the first Story. The introduced landscape should primarily be of a durable species tolerant of soil compaction. 
5.6. - VISION CLEARANCE. 
5.6.1. Intent. It is the intent of these regulations to provide protection from traffic hazards at intersections for motorized vehicles and their passengers and for cyclists and pedestrians, including small children. 
5.6.2. Material Impediment to Visibility: Construed. Given the above intent, the phrase "Material Impediments to Visibility" as used here is to be construed as any material obstruction to Visibility which would result in concealment of a child over two and one-half (21/2) feet in height approaching an intersection, or would conceal an approaching motorized vehicle or cyclist from such a child. In determinations as to whether or not there is a Material Impediment to Visibility, the speed, direction, and duration of movement to point of potential collision or contact shall be considered. 
5.6.3. Adjacent to Thoroughfares, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to form a Material Impediment to Visibility between the heights of two and one-half (2 1/2) feet and ten (10) feet above the street grade level within the Visibility Triangle described below: 
a.  At Thoroughfare intersections with Building Setbacks: Visibility Triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first twenty-five (25) feet along the intersecting edges of the right-of-way (or Base Building Line) projected where rounded, and a line running across the Lot and connecting the ends of such twenty-five (25) foot lines. See Article 4, Table 13. 
b.  At intersection of driveways with Thoroughfares with Building Setbacks: Visibility Triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first ten (10) feet along the intersecting edges of the Base Building Line and the driveway, projected where rounded, and a line running across any intervening right-of-way and the Lot and connecting the ends of such ten (10) foot lines. See Article 4, Table 13. 
c.  At Thoroughfare intersections with Buildings and no Setbacks: Visibility Triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first ten (10) feet along the intersecting edges of the Base Building Line, projected where rounded, and a line running across the Lot and connecting the ends of such ten (10) foot lines. See Article 4, Table 13. 
d.  At intersections of driveways with Thoroughfares with no Building Setbacks: Visibility Triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first five (5) feet along the intersecting edges of the Base Building Line and the driveway, projected where rounded, and a line running across any intervening right-of-way and the Lot and connecting the ends of such five (5) foot lines. See Article 4, Table 13. 
e.  At all Thoroughfare intersections: Visibility Triangles shall be maintained to include an area bounded by the first ten (10) feet along the intersecting edges of the Base Building Line, projected where rounded, and a line running across the Lot and connecting the ends of such ten (10) foot lines. See Article 4, Table 13.
