2.04.040 Rules Of Conduct
Business shall be brought before the council by motion in accordance with the following standards of conduct:
(a) Obtaining the Floor. Any member of the council wishing to speak must first obtain the floor by being recognized by the chair. The chair must recognize any council member who seeks the floor when appropriately entitled to do so.
(b) Motions. The mayor or any member of the council may bring a matter of business before the council by making a motion. Before the matter can be considered or debated it must be seconded. Once the motion has been properly made and seconded. the chair shall open the matter for debate offering the first opportunity to debate to the moving party and, thereafter, to any council member properly recognized by the chair. Once the matter has been fully debated and the chair calls for a vote, no further debate will be allowed; provided, however, council members may be allowed to explain their vote.
(c) Voting. All council members present at a meeting when a question comes up for a vote, shall vote for or against the measure. If the vote is a voice vote, the chair shall declare the result and note for the record all “aye” votes and all “no” votes. The council may also vote by roll call vote, ballot or voting machine. Regardless of the manner of voting, the results reflecting all “ayes” and “noes” must be clearly set forth for the record.
(d) Procedural Rules of Order. Once the main motion is properly placed on the floor, several related motions may be employed in addressing the main motion. These motions take precedence over the main motion, and if properly made and seconded, must be disposed of before the main motion can be acted upon. The following motions are appropriate and may be made by the mayor or any council member at any appropriate time during the discussion of the main motion. They are listed in order of precedence. The first three subsidiary motions are nondebatable; the last four are debatable. All subsidiary motions require a simple majority vote for passage.
(1) Subsidiary Motions.
(i) Lay on the Table. Any council members including the mayor, may move to lay the matter under discussion on the table. This motion temporarily suspends any further discussion of the pending motion without setting a time certain to resume debate. It must be moved, seconded and passed by a majority vote. In order to bring the matter back before the council, a member must move that the matter be taken from the table, seconded and passed. A motion to take from the table must be made at the same meeting at which it was placed on the table or at the next regular meeting of the council. Otherwise, the motion that was tabled dies, although it can be raised later as a new motion.
(ii) Move the Previous Question. Any council member may move to immediately bring the question being debated by the council to a vote, suspending any further debate.
(iii) Limit or Extend Limits of Debate. Any council member may move to put limits on the length of debate.
(iv) Postpone to a Time Certain. Any council member may move to postpone the pending question to a time certain. This motion continues the pending main motion to a future date as determined by the council at the time the motion is passed.
(v) Commit or Refer. Any council member may move that the matter being discussed should be referred to a committee or commission for further study. The motion may contain directions for the committee or commission, as well as a date upon which the matter will be returned to the council’s agenda. If no date is set for returning the item to the council agenda, any council member may move, at any time, to require the time be returned to the agenda.
(vi) Amend. Any council member may amend the main motion or any amendment made to the main motion. Before the main motion may be acted upon, all amendments and amendments to amendments must first be acted upon. Any amendment must be related to the main motion or amendment to which it is directed. Any amendment which substitutes a new motion rather than amending the existing motion is out of order and may be so declared by the chair.
(vii) Postpone Indefinitely. Any council member may move to postpone indefinitely the motion on the floor, thus avoiding a direct vote on the pending motion and suspending any further action on the matter.
(2) Motion of Privilege, Order and Convenience. The following actions by the council are to insure orderly conduct of meetings and for the convenience of the mayor and council members. Those motions take precedence over any pending main or subsidiary motion and may or may not be debated as noted.
(i) Call for Orders of the Day. Any council member may demand that the agenda be followed in the order stated therein. No second is required and the chair must comply unless the council, by vote, sets aside the orders of the day.
(ii) Questions of Privilege. Any council member. at any time during the meeting, may make a request of the chair to accommodate the needs of the council or his/her personal needs for such things as reducing noise, adjusting air conditioning, ventilation, lighting, etc. Admissibility of question is ruled on by the chair.
(iii) Recess. Any council member may move for a recess. The motion must be seconded and a majority vote is required for passage. The motion is debatable.
(iv) Adjourn. Any council member may move to adjourn at any time, even if there is business pending. The motion must be seconded and a majority vote is required for passage. The motion is not debatable.
(v) Point of Order. Any council member may require the chair to enforce the rules of the council by raising a point of order. The point of order shall be ruled upon by the chair.
(vi) Appeal, Should any council member be dissatisfied with a ruling from the chair, he/she may move to appeal the ruling to the full council. The motion must be seconded to put it before the council. A majority vote in the negative or a tie vote sustains the ruling of the chair. The motion is debatable and the chair may participate in the debate.
(vii) Suspend the Rules. Any council member may move to suspend the rules if necessary to accomplish a matter that would otherwise violate the rules. The motion requires a second and a majority vote for passage.
(viii) Division of Question. Any council member may move to divide the subject matter of a motion which is made up of several parts in order to vote separately on each part. The motion requires a second and a majority vote for passage. This motion may also be applied to complex ordinances or resolutions.
(ix) Reconsider. Except for votes regarding matters which are quasi-judicial in nature or matters which require a noticed public hearing, the council may reconsider any vote taken at the same session, but no later than the same or next calendar day, to correct inadvertent or precipitant errors, or consider new information not available at the time of the vote. The motion to reconsider must be seconded and requires a majority vote for passage, regardless of the vote required to adopt the motion being reconsidered. If the motion to reconsider is successful, the matter to be reconsidered takes no special precedence over other pending matters and any special voting requirements related thereto still apply. Except pursuant to a motion to reconsider, once a matter has been determined and voted upon, the same matter cannot be brought up again at the same meeting.
(x) Rescind, Repeal or Annul. The council may rescind, repeal or annul any prior action taken with reference to any legislative matter so long as the action to rescind, repeal or annul complies with all the rules applicable to the initial adoption, including any special voting or notice requirements or unless otherwise specified by law.
(e) Authority of the Chair. Subject to appeal, the chair shall have the authority to prevent the misuse of the legitimate form of motions, or the abuse of privilege of renewing certain motions, to obstruct the business of the council by ruling such motions out of order. In so ruling, the chair shall be courteous and fair and should presume that the moving party is making the motion in good faith.
(f) Public Hearings. Matters which are required to be heard at a noticed public hearing shall be conducted in the following manner:
(1) Time for Consideration.

being recognized by the mayor. Members of the council who wish to ask questions of the speakers or each other, during the public hearing portion, may do so but only after first being recognized by the mayor. The mayor shall conduct the meeting in such a manner as to afford due process.
All persons interested in the matter being heard by council shall be entitled to submit written evidence or remarks, as well as other graphic evidence. All such evidence presented shall be retained by the city clerk and made a part of the clerk’s record. Time limits may be established by the council, limiting the duration of presentations as set forth herein. No person shall be permitted during the hearing to speak about matters or present evidence which are not germane to the matter being considered. A determination of relevance of such matters shall be made by the mayor but may be appealed as set forth here and before.
(4) Consideration of Question by Council. After all members of the public desiring to speak upon the subject of the hearing have been given an opportunity to do so, the public hearing shall be closed by the mayor and the council may consider what disposition they wish to make of the question or questions presented at the hearing. No member of the public shall be allowed, without consent of the mayor, to speak further on the question during this period of deliberation, although the council members may ask questions of the speakers if so desired. At the conclusion of the council discussion, an appropriate motion having been made and seconded, the council shall vote on the matter.
(5) Reports and Resolutions. All committee reports together with all resolutions shall be filed with the city clerk and shall be entered in the minutes.

(a) To encourage the city official in question to appoint a sufficient number of deputies to transact business in the absence of such city official. The city manager shall endeavor to, whenever possible and feasible, provide staff support to the city official who may function as deputies in the absence of such city official.

(c) The city manager may take any other actions reasonably necessary to cause city business to be conducted continuously and efficiently should a city official be unavailable to perform their duties on behalf of the city.
As used in this section, a city official shall be deemed to be absent or unavailable if such official is not physically present at the City Hall and the business to be conducted, or the transaction in question is ordinarily transacted at City Hall. A city official shall not be deemed absent if a duly authorized deputy or designee of such city official, with authority to transact business on behalf of the city, is physically present at City Hall.

Neither the payment of the tax nor the possession of the business tax certificate authorizes, permits or allows the doing of any act which the person paying or holding the same would not otherwise be entitled to do; and any permit, license, variance or other instrument of approval or evidence that any conditions exist as required by any other section of this code or by any statute or code provisions of the state must first be obtained or complied with before the doing of any act or thing for which it is required. (Ord. 428 (part). 1996)
5.08.050 Branch Establishments
A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or location of the business transacted and carried on and for each separate type of business at the same location, and each license shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on only the business licensed thereby at the location or in the manner designated in such license; provided that warehouses and distributing plants used in connection with and incidental to a business licensed under the provisions of Chapters 5.04 through 5.36 shall not be deemed to be separate places of business or branch establishments. (Ord. 428 (part). 1996)
5.08.060 Evidence Of Doing Business
When any person shall by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone books, or newspapers, advertise, hold out, or represent that he is in business in the city, or when any person holds an active license or permit issued by a governmental agency indicating that he is in business in the city, and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the collector that he is not conducting a business in the city, after being requested to do so by the collector, then these facts shall be considered prima facie evidence that he is conducting a business in the city. (Ord. 428 (part), 1996)
5.08.070 Identification Of New Businesses Operating In The City
A. General Contractor’s Statement. Every person acting as a general contractor, whether building for their own occupancy or not, shall file with the collector a full, true and complete written statement, signed by such person, under penalty of perjury, listing all subcontractors who have performed or shall perform any service whatsoever for such person within the city for which a license is required under the provisions of this chapter.

Said statement shall include the name, address, telephone number, state license number and specialty classification of each person required to be licensed.

Failure to comply with conditions required by other agency review shall result in revocation of the license once granted. (Ord. 428 (part). 1996)
5.08.090 Constitutional Apportionment
A. None of the license taxes provided for by Chapters 5.04 through 5.36 shall be applied so as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the state.
B. In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show this method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will as sure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by Chapter 5.32. Should the collector determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, the collector may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant’s business in the city, or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefore; provided, that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee has paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in Chapter 5.32. (Ord. 428 (part), 1996)
5.08.100 Severability
If any article, section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the chapter. The city council hereby declares that it would have passed this chapter and each article, section, subsection,
sentence, clause, or phrase hereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more of the articles, sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases hereof be declared invalid or unconstitutional. (Ord. 428 (part), 1996)

9.03.050 Violation, Enforcement and Penalties
9.03.010 Purpose
The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce the incidents of juvenile loitering and truancy that create a burden upon the health, safety and welfare of the community. Students who are absent from school are more likely to participate in unlawful activities and to become victims of crime. In addition, they impose an extraordinary burden on the manpower and resources of law enforcement because juveniles taken into custody must be supervised by law enforcement personnel until they are released to a parent or guardian. Personnel supervising these juveniles are then unavailable to carry out law enforcement duties in the field thereby decreasing the level of protection afforded to the community. The City Council finds that having an enforceable juvenile loitering and truancy ordinance is critical to addressing these concerns and determines that a special need exists for the adoption of such an ordinance.
9.03.020 Definitions

(d) “Establishment” means any privately owned place of business operated for a profit to which the public is invited, including but not limited to, any place of amusement or entertainment.
(e) “Guardian” means a person who, or private agency that, under court order, has been named the guardian of the juvenile.
(f) “Juvenile” means any person less than eighteen (18) years of age who is not emancipated pursuant to law.
(g) “Loitering” means to linger or hang around in a public place or establishment where one has no particular or legal purpose.
(h) “Parent” means a person who is the natural or adoptive mother or father of a person.
(i) “Public place” means any place to which the public has access and includes but is not limited to public streets, highways, roads, alleys, parks, playgrounds, public buildings, public right-of-ways, public grounds, dedicated open or trail space, or privately owned land that is unsupervised and from which the public is not expressly excluded under applicable trespass laws, including but not limited to vacant lots, parking lots and the common areas of hospitals, apartment complexes, housing complexes, office buildings, transport facilities, shopping centers and malls.

turning away potential customers from the places of business within the area where drug dealers, drug users and purchasers congregate to sell, consume and purchase drugs.
C. It is a legitimate need of the City of Live Oak to address problems inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the community and loitering with the intent to commit certain illegal acts is such a problem.

D. The person behaves in a manner as to raise reasonable suspicion that he or she is seeking to engage in, or is about to engage in, or is then engaged in any unlawful drug activity, including, by way of example only, acting as a “lookout,” making gestures or statements to motorists or pedestrians known to represent invitations to purchase or sell drugs, or exchanging small objects or packages with another person in a furtive manner.
E. The person is identified as a member of a criminal street gang, as defined, in Section 186,22(f) of the Penal Code, or a group which has, among its members, known unlawful drug users, possessors, or sellers. The method of identification may include, but is not limited to, the wearing of distinctive clothing or insignias,
F. The person attempts to conceal himself or herself from the observation of the arresting officer or conceals or disposes of any object which reasonably could be involved in the conduct of any unlawful drug activity.

It is the intent of these regulations that all new employers strive to increase average vehicle ridership. New employers are required to put forth a good faith effort to encourage employees to use alternative transportation modes through the methods described below.
These trip reduction regulations apply to all new employers with more than 500 employees. It specifically excludes all existing employers. (Ord. 407 § 2 (part), 1994)
10.81.040 Definitions
The following definitions shall apply to these regulations:
A. Alternative Commute Mode. “Alternative commute mode” is a method of traveling to and from the worksite other than by single occupant vehicle (i.e., transit, carpool, vanpool, bicycle, walking, telecommuting).
B. Average Vehicle Ridership (AVR). “Average vehicle ridership” is the average number of persons occupying each vehicle. AVR is calculated by multiplying the number of employees by the standard number of trips in a work week (generally 10), then dividing by the actual number of vehicular trips per work week. For example, if all employees drive alone to work each day, the AVR = 1.0. 10 employees would be expected to take 10 trips each per week for a total of 100 trips. If only 67 vehicular trips are taken, then the AVR is 1.5, which means that, on average, each vehicle is transporting 1.5 people to their destination. The higher the AVR, the more people are using alternative transportation methods.
C. Carpool. “Carpool” is a motor vehicle occupied by two or more persons traveling to and from work.
D. Commuter. “Commuter” is an employee who travels regularly to and from an employment facility three or more days a week.
E. Commuter Matching Service. “Commuter matching service” is any system for mapping and matching home and work locations of interested commuters to identify prospects for ridesharing.
F. Employee. “Employee” is a person employed at a location for at least twenty hours a week.
G. Employee Transportation Coordinator (ETC). “Employee transportation coordinator” is an employee or other individual designated by the employer to coordinate and implement TCM activities as required by the transportation plan.
H. New Employer. “New employer” means any business, nonprofit organization, or public agency with one or more employees, including the owner, that locates in Live Oak after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter.
I Peak Period Commuter. “Peak period commuter” means any employee who travels regularly to and from a work facility three or more days a week and arrives or departs from the facility during
the weekday peak period specified by the jurisdiction. This peak period should be linked to the hours that commuter congestion actually occurs.
J. Rideshare Program. “Rideshare program” means the commuter matching service operated by Caltrans-Sacramento Rideshare.
K. Ridesharer. “Ridesharer” means any employee who commutes to and from his or her work location by any mode other than single occupancy light or medium duty vehicle, motorcycle or moped.
L. Shift of Employment. “Shift of employment” is any group of employees who work at a common work location and who arrive and depart from work in a common time interval not greater than one hour.
M. Single Occupant Vehicle. “Single occupant vehicle” is a motor vehicle occupied by one employee for commute purposes.
N. Transportation Control Measures (TCMs). “Transportation control measures (TCMs)” are measures used to maintain or improve the efficient movement of persons and goods while reducing the congestion and air quality impacts associated with motorized vehicles.
O. Transportation Control Measure (TCM) Coordinator. “Transportation control measure (TCM) coordinator” is a public agency employee or other individual designated to manage and enforce employer compliance with these trip reduction regulations.
P. Transportation Management Association (TMA). “Transportation management association (TMA)” is an association, usually of employers, developers, property managers, and public agencies, organized to facilitate, support and encourage the use of alternative transportation methods for commuters.
Q. Transportation Plan. “Transportation plan” is the plan developed by the employer to reduce single occupant vehicle trips, pursuant to Section 10.81.050.
R. Trip Reduction Credit. “Trip reduction credit” is the number of points credited to an employer’s transportation plan for implementing a specific transportation control measure (TCM) program.
S. Vanpool. “Vanpool” is a motor vehicle, other than a motor truck or truck tractor, suited for occupancy by more than six but less than sixteen persons including the driver, traveling to and from work. (Ord. 407 § 2 (part), 1994)

The enforcement agency shall make an inspection of the annular seal construction work. It may make an initial inspection of each proposed drilling site, an inspection at the completion of the work, and inspections at such other times as it deems appropriate.
A. Initial Inspection. Upon receipt of an application, the enforcement agency may make an inspection of the drilling site prior to the issuance of a well permit. The purpose of this inspection is to determine whether there are any site conditions such that the enforcement agency shall do the following:
1. Relocation of Drilling Site. Require relocation of the drilling site should the location shown on the permit application be too close to potential sources of pollution;
2. Additional Conditions. Set additional conditions if needed to remediate any previously unknown groundwater quality protection problems.

1. Required Notice. The enforcement shall be notified by the well driller a minimum of twenty-four hours prior to sealing the annular space. Drillers who anticipate completing a well in less than one day shall notify the enforcement agency twenty-four hours prior to commencement of drilling and provide the anticipated time to commence the sealing of the annular space.
2. Should Enforcement Agency Fail to Be Present. If the enforcement agency wishes to allow a seal to be tremied or placed without inspection, the driller shall seal the well in accordance with the standards of this chapter and any permit conditions. No seal shall be tremied or placed until permission to proceed is given.
C. Final Inspection. If requested by the enforcement agency, the driller shall notify the enforcement agency within seven days of the completion of their work at each drilling site. The enforcement agency may make a final inspection after completion of the work to determine whether the well was completed in accordance with this chapter.
D. Waiver of Inspections. The enforcement agency may waive inspections should any of the following conditions exist:
1. Well Inspected by Other Agencies. Inspections may be waived where the work will be inspected by the staff of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board or the California Department of Health Services if these designated agencies will inspect and report to the enforcement agency on all drilling features required by the Standards.
2. Monitoring Wells under Specified Conditions. Inspections may be waived for monitoring wells that will penetrate only aquifers containing degraded waters or will penetrate only formations that normally contain no water.
3. Drilling Sites Known to Have No Threats to Groundwater Quality. Initial inspections may be waived when the drilling site is well known to the enforcement agency staff, and it is known that no significant threats to groundwater quality exist in the area. (Ord. 338 (part), 1990)

This report shall document that the
work was completed in accordance with the standards and all additional permit conditions. This section shall not be deemed to release any person from the requirement to file the report with the state Department of Water Resources.
B. Confidentiality of Report. In accordance with California Water Code Section 13752, reports shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available for inspection by governmental agencies for use in making studies. Reports shall be made available to any person who obtains written authorization from the owner of the well.
C. Other Agency’s Requirements. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to excuse any person from compliance with the provisions of California Water Code Sections 13750 through 13755 relating to notices and reports of completion or any other federal, state or local reporting regulations.

13.32.130 Minimum Size Of Building And Lateral Sewers
Pipe for building sewers shall have an internal diameter equal to or greater than that of the building drain to which it connects. The minimum diameter of building sewers shall be three inches and lateral sewers shall be four inches. When more than one building sewer is allowed to
be connected to a single side sewer, the side sewer from the point of intersection of one or more building sewers to the public sewer shall be not less than six inches in diameter. (Ord. 249 § 405, 1979)
13.32.135 Building Drain Location
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. (Ord. 249 § 406, 1979)
13.32.140 Surface Runoff
Surface runoffs, such as the connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater seepage to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer, shall not be made. (Ord. 249 § 407, 1979)
13.32.145 Connecting The Building Sewer To The Public Sewer

Existing building drains and building sewers which have become deteriorated or sewers which have become distorted in cross-section and which no longer retain their original cross-sectional shape shall be replaced at the expense of the owner. If the director or building official inspects
any building drain or building sewer and determines that it is collapsed and distorted in cross-section or deterioration has occurred, he may direct that all or a portion of the building drain and building sewer be removed and replaced with approved materials. If a building sewer, upon inspection, is determined to be made of bituminous fiber pipe, notwithstanding the absence of any deterioration or distortion, said bituminous fiber pipe shall be replaced with approved materials in its entirety, except as otherwise permitted by the director.
Portions of existing building drains and building sewers which are deteriorated or collapsed permit excessive infiltration and inflow into the public sewer system which results in sewage spills into streets and public areas and excessive costs for operating and maintaining the city sewage system. Spills of sewage are a violation of the waste discharge requirements of the state of California, are a violation of the Health and Safety Code of the state and are a threat to public health and safety.
Upon written notification to a property owner that a building sewer or building drain is deteriorated or distorted, the owner shall replace such deteriorated and distorted building drains and building sewers in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Uniform Plumbing Code as adopted by the city.

Tributary Area
Ratio of Peak to Average Sewage Flow
0 – 100 acres
3.0
100 – 300
2.5
B. Industrial Sewage Flow, Sewage flow for industrial areas shall be determined by the proposed type of industry. If the type of industry is unknown, design values shall be five one-thousandths CFS per acre average flow and fifteen one-thousandths per acre peak flow.
C. Infiltration and Stormwater Inflow. An allowance shall be made for infiltration in an amount approved by the director. (Ord. 249 § 530, 1979)
13.32.330 Marking Lateral Sewer Lines
On all new subdivision work, the lateral sewer lines from the main sewer to the property line shall be installed and capped if necessary at the time the sewer is constructed. Each lateral sewer line shall be referenced to the plan stationing, and the terminal end marked with a two inch by two inch by twenty-four inch redwood stake painted white if the subdivision does not have curbs. If the subdivision has curbs and gutters, the location of each sewer lateral shall be indicated on the face of the curb by a capital letter “S” indented into the concrete face of the curb. The letter shall be placed on the curb by using a stamping tool. The position of the letter shall be uniformly placed at each location and the letter shall be approximately two inches in height. The style and depth of the indented portion of the letter shall be approved by the director. (Ord, 249 § 531, 1979)

Force main pipe shall be cast iron pipe or asbestos cement pipe in full flowing force mains of the size and type approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 249 § 532, 1979)
13.32.340 Installation Of Sewers
A. Lines and Grades. All lines and grades will be given by the city engineer and the director shall be informed twenty-four hours in advance of the time and places at which work is to be done in order that lines and grades may be inspected. All stakes and marks once placed shall be fully protected and preserved. Flow line elevations shall be established at all changes in grade and at a minimum of fifty-foot intervals.
B. Excavation. Trenches shall be excavated to three inches below flow line or one inch below outside diameter of bell, whichever is greater. Under cutting to be filled with clean sand or pea gravel unless trench material is granular or sandy. Director is to be the sole judge of the suitability of the material. When the trench is in an existing paved area, the pavement is to be cut accurately with proper tools and equipment of required width for trench. Whenever the bottom of the trench is soft, yielding or unsuitable as a foundation for pipe, sufficient crushed rock or clean gravel is to be tamped into the soft material.
Whenever water is encountered all trenches shall be kept dry until the placing of the bedding materials has been completed, inspected and approved.
Whenever the bottom of the trench is in rocky material, the trench shall be excavated to six inches below flowline and backfilled to grade with crushed and graded rock of three-fourths inch maximum size, or approved granular material.
C. Bracing and Shoring. As required by the Trench Construction Safety Orders of the California State Division of Industrial Safety, sufficient bracing and shoring shall be installed in trenches to insure the safety of workmen, and to protect and facilitate the work.
D. Pipe Laying. Sewer pipe shall be laid to the line and grade established by the city engineer by measuring down to the flowline of each joint as it is laid from an overhead string line supported by the batter boards at each point which has been set by the city engineer. The string line shall be set and maintained by the contractor by measuring from three consecutive points shown on the same rate of grade or slope, in order to detect any variation from a straight grade, and in case any such discrepancy exists, it must be reported to the city engineer. If such discrepancy is not reported to the city engineer, the contractor shall be responsible for any error in the finished work.
Pipe shall be laid continuously upgrade with the bell of the pipe upstream. Each length of pipe shall be laid on a firm bed and shall have a true bearing for the entire length between bell holes. No wedging or blocking up of the pipe will be permitted. Pipe found to be damaged must be replaced by new sections. Repair clamps will not be allowed.
Both bell and spigot shall be clean before the joint is made and care shall be taken that nothing but the joint making material enters the joints. When for any reason, pipe laying is discontinued for an hour or more, the open end of all lines shall be closed with a close-fitting stopper.
E. Trench Backfill. Material compaction and placement of trench backfill shall conform to Section 19 of the Standard Specifications of the Department of Transportation of the state of California except as otherwise permitted by the director.
F. Bedding. Selected backfill material, approved by the director and meeting the minimum standards listed below, shall be deposited and compacted in the trench uniformly on both sides of the pipe for the full width of the trench and to a depth of six inches over the top of the pipe.
G. Backfill Material. Trench backfill material and construction shall conform to the requirements of Structure Backfill Material as set forth in Section 19 of the California Standard Specifications unless otherwise approved by the director. (Ord. 249 § 533, 1979)
13.32.345 Testing Of Sewer Lines
After sewer lines have been backfilled to a depth where additional backfilling will not disturb the position of the pipe and before placing permanent surfacing, all or any sections that the director may select shall be hydrostatically tested, except as specified in this chapter. In no case shall the required minimum compacted backfill be less than three feet above the top of the pipe before subjecting the line to the test. Service laterals shall be considered part of main for purposes of leakage testing. Any individually detectable leaks shall be repaired regardless of the results of testing. The permittee shall furnish all labor, tools, material and equipment for testing.
A. Exfiltration Test. A section of sewer line shall be prepared for testing by plugging the upstream side of a downstream manhole and all openings in the upstream manhole except the downstream opening. Where grades are slight, two or more sections between manholes may be tested at one time. Where grades are steep, and excessive test heads would be developed by testing from one manhole to another, test tees the full size of the main shall be installed at intermediate points so that the maximum head on any section under test will not exceed twelve feet. A section of sewer line prepared as herein described shall be tested by filling the water to an elevation of five feet above the top of the pipe at the upstream end of the test section or five feet above the existing groundwater elevation, which ever is greater.
Water shall be introduced into the test section a minimum of four hours in advance of the test period to allow for saturation. The pipe line being tested shall then be refilled to the original water level.
At the beginning of the test, the elevation of the water in the upper manhole shall be carefully measured from a point on the manhole rim. After a period of four hours or less, with the approval of the director, the water elevation shall be measured from the same point of the manhole rim and the loss of water during this test period calculated. If this calculation shows a decrease, enough water shall be measured into the upper manhole to restore the water to the level existing at the beginning of the test and the amount added be taken as the total leakage.
Should an initial test show excessive leakage in a section of line, it is permissible to test the individual manholes separately. This test shall be made by plugging all the openings in the man hole and filling with water to the same elevation as existed during the test. The leakage from the manhole may be deducted from the total leakage of the test section in arriving at the test leakage.
After testing is completed, the manholes shall be waterproofed by grouting and/or other approved waterproofing methods otherwise satisfactory to the director. The allowable leakage in the test section shall, under no circumstances, exceed one hundred gallons per mile per day per inch of diameter of pipe tested at the specified five-foot test head. If it is necessary or desirable to increase the test head above five feet, the allowable leakage will be increased to the rate of eighty gallons for each foot of increase in head. Test sections showing leakage in excess of that allowed shall be repaired or reconstructed as necessary to reduce the leakage to the within specified limits and the line shall be again tested in accordance with the above procedure.
B. Infiltration Test. Should the presence of groundwater, in the opinion of the director, cause the exfiltration test to be nonconclusive, the contractor shall conduct an infiltration test by plugging
to a watertight condition a section of any line. A suitable measuring device shall be employed at the lower end of a section to measure the amount of water flowing through the device during a specified period of time. This leakage shall not exceed one hundred gallons per mile per day per inch of diameter of pipe tested.
All service lines to individual services shall be considered as part of the lines to be tested. Trapped air shall be released from lines being tested. Test sections showing leakage in excess of that allowed by these specifications shall be repaired or reconstructed as necessary to reduce the leak age to allowable limits as specified in this chapter.
The use of repair clamps shall not be allowed on new construction.
C. Air Testing. Should the permittee so elect he may request the director to permit air testing. The director may then approve or disapprove air testing. (Ord. 249 § 534, 1979)
13.32.350 Manholes
Manholes shall conform to the “Standard Details of the City of Live Oak.” Manholes shall be watertight structures and shall not be subject to infiltration at maximum heads. (Ord. 249 § 535, 1979)
13.32.355 Sewer Construction Inspections
A. All Work to be Inspected. All sewer construction work shall be inspected by an inspector acting for the city to insure compliance with all the requirements of the city. No sewer shall be covered at any point until it has been inspected and passed for acceptance. No sewer shall be connected to the city’s public sewer until the work covered by the permit has been completed, inspected, and approved by the inspector. If the test proves satisfactory and the sewer has been cleaned of all debris accumulated from construction operations, the director shall issue a certificate of satisfactory completion.
B. Time Limits on Permits. If work under a permit is not commenced within six months after the date of the issuance of the permit, or if, after partial completion, the work is discontinued for a period of one year, the permit shall thereupon become void, and no further work shall be done until a new permit shall have been secured. A new fee shall be paid upon the issuance of such new permit.
C. Notification. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by the permit to notify the public works department that such work is ready for inspection. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work to make sure that the work will stand the tests required by the city before giving such notification.
D. Condemned Work. When any work has been inspected and the work condemned and no certification of satisfactory completion given, a written notice to that effect shall be given instructing the owner of the premises, or the agent of such owner, to repair the sewer or other work authorized by the permit in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations of the city.
E. All Costs Paid by Owners. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of any sewer or other work for which an encroachment permit has been issued shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the city from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the work.
F. Street Excavation Permits. A separate encroachment permit shall be secured from the city by owners or contractors intending to excavate in a public street for the purpose of installing public sewers.
G. Liability. The city and its officers, agents, and employees shall not be answerable for any liability or injury or death to any person or damage to any property arising during or growing out of the performance of any work by such applicant. The applicant shall be answerable for, and shall save the city and its officers, agents, and employees harmless from, any liability imposed by law upon the city or its officers, agents, or employees, including all costs, expenses, fees, and interest incurred in defending the same or in seeking to enforce this provision. The applicant shall be solely liable for any defects in the performance of his work or any failure which may develop therein. (Ord. 249 § 536, 1979)
13.32.360 Guarantee
All work shall be unconditionally guaranteed by the permittee against defects for one year from the date of completion.
If within the guarantee period, repairs are required in connection with the work which, in the opinion of the director, is necessary as the result of the use of materials, equipment, or workmanship which are inferior, defective, or otherwise not in accordance with the terms of the permit, the permittee shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from the city, and without expense to the city, place in satisfactory condition in every particular, all work correcting all defects therein; make good all damage to structures, the site, plantings, or work disturbed in fulfilling the guarantee. Defects to be corrected by the permittee shall include, but are not limited to, broken or damaged pipe, infiltration or exfiltration, offset pipe joints, variations from the planned line and grade which in the opinion of the city affect the serviceability or maintenance of the system. Subsidence of surfaced and unsurfaced sewer line trench backfill shall be considered as a defect in workmanship. Correction of any such defects will be made by the permittee at no cost to the city.

The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The director may set limitations lower than the limitations established in the regulations below if in his opinion such more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the director will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the director are as follows:
A. Wastewater having a temperature higher than one hundred twenty degrees Fahrenheit;
B. Wastewater containing more than twenty-five milligrams per liter of petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, or product of mineral oil origin;
C. Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat, or grease;
D. Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see Section 13.32.020). Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by caterers;
E. Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and similar objectionable or toxic substances to such degree that any such material received in the composite wastewater at the wastewater treatment works exceeds the limits established by the director for such materials;
F. Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding limits which may be established by the director;
G. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the director in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;

13.32.410 Special Agreement
No statement contained in Sections 13.32.365 through 13.32.410 shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment. (Ord. 249 § 609, 1979)
ARTICLE VI INDUSTRIAL
WASTE WATER
13.32.415 Industrial User Defined
“Industrial user” means any nongovernmental user of publicly-owned treatment works. An industrial user shall be defined as any user who discharges more than twenty-five thousand gallons per day of wastewater, or its equivalent into the public sewage system and this includes all discharges of toxic wastewater at any volume. For purposes of determining an equivalent discharge of industrial wastewater, standard BOD shall be taken not to exceed two hundred parts per million and suspended solids shall not exceed two hundred parts per million. In determining the amount of an industrial users discharge for the purposes of industrial cost recovery, the amount of sewage which is domestic waste from sanitary conveniences may be excluded. (Ord. 249 § 701, 1979)
13.32.420 Existing Industrial Wastewater Dischargers
All persons discharging industrial wastewater directly or indirectly to the city’s sewage systems prior to the effective date of this chapter and who have obtained a permit or approval of industrial wastewater discharge from the city, shall be granted a temporary permit to discharge industrial wastewaters. This temporary permit shall expire in six months after notification by the director of public works that a new permit is to be obtained, or after notification by the effective date of this chapter, whichever shall occur first. Prior to the expiration of the temporary permit, the industrial wastewater discharger shall apply for and obtain a permit for industrial wastewater discharge. (Ord. 249 § 702, 1979)
13.32.425 Discharge Permit—Required
No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to sewage facilities owned by the city without first obtaining a city permit for industrial wastewater discharge. The permit for industrial wastewater discharge may require the pretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, the restriction of peak flow discharges, the discharge of certain wastewaters only to specified sewers of the city, the relocation of the point of discharge, the prohibition of the discharge of certain wastewater components, the restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, the payment of additional charges to defray the increased costs of the city created by the wastewater discharge and such other conditions as may be required to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.
No city permit for industrial wastewater discharge shall be transferable without the prior written consent of the director.
No person shall discharge industrial wastewaters in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by the permit for industrial wastewater discharge. Any person desiring to discharge wastewaters or use facilities which are not in conformance with the industrial wastewater permit should apply to the city for an amended permit. All pretreatment systems and devices shall be approved by the city engineer. (Ord, 249 § 703, 1979)
13.32.430 Discharge Permit—Application-—- Restrictions
A. Procedure. Applicants for permits for industrial wastewater discharges shall complete a city application form and submit the application form and appurtenant plans and data to the city for review and approval. The city may require additional information on the characteristics of the wastewater discharges beyond that required on the application form.
Upon the receipt of all required information, the application shall be processed and, upon approval, be signed by representatives of the city and one copy returned to the applicant. When properly signed, the application form shall constitute a valid permit for industrial wastewater discharge.
The application shall be approved if the applicant has complied with all the applicable requirements of this chapter and furnished to the city all of the requested information, if the director determines that there is adequate capacity in the city facilities to convey, treat, and dispose of such wastewaters.
B. Change of Industrial Wastewater Permit Restrictions. The city may change the restrictions or conditions of a permit for industrial wastewater discharge from time to time as circumstances may require. The city shall allow an industrial discharger a reasonable period of time to comply with any changes in the industrial wastewater permit required by the city. (Ord. 249 § 704, 1979)
13.32.435 Discharge Permit—Suspension
The director may suspend a permit for industrial wastewater discharge for a period not to exceed forty-five days when such suspension is necessary in order to stop a discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, to the local environment or to the city’s sewage system.
Any discharger notified of a suspension of his industrial wastewater permit shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all industrial wastewater to the sewage system. In the event of
failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as necessary to insure compliance.
Appeals from suspension may be made under Section 13.32.070. The permit shall be reinstated upon proof of satisfactory compliance with all discharge requirements of the city. (Ord. 249 § 705, 1979)
13.32.440 Discharge Permit—Revocation
The city council may revoke a permit for industrial wastewater discharge upon finding that the discharger has violated any provision of this chapter. No revocation shall be ordered until a hearing has been held by the city council under Sections 13.32.530 through 13.32.570 of this chapter.
Any discharger whose industrial wastewater permit has been revoked shall immediately stop all discharge of any liquid-carried wastes covered by the permit to any public sewer that is tributary to the sewer or sewage system of the city. The director may block from such public sewer, or may permanently disconnect the industrial connection sewer of any discharger whose permit has been revoked, if such action is necessary to insure compliance.
Before any further discharge of industrial wastewater may be made by the discharger, he must apply for a new permit for industrial wastewater discharge, pay all charges that would be required upon initial application together with any delinquent fees, and penalties and such other sums as the discharger may owe to the city. Costs incurred by the city in revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial connection sewer shall be paid by the discharger before the issuance of a new permit for industrial wastewater discharge. (Ord. 249 § 706. 1979)
13.32.445 Availability Of City’s Facilities
If sewage capacity is not available, the city may require the industrial wastewater discharger to restrict his discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available. When requested, the city will advise persons desiring to locate new facilities as to the areas where industrial wastewater of their proposed quantity or quality can be received by available sewage facilities. The city may refuse service to persons locating facilities in areas where their proposed quantities or qualities of industrial wastewater is unacceptable in the available treatment facility. (Ord. 249 § 707, 1979)
13.32.450 Control Manhole And Separation Of Domestic And Industrial Wastewaters
All domestic or sanitary wastewaters from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains, etc., shall be kept separated from all industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment system or device.
A control manhole of a design approved by the director shall be furnished and installed by the industrial wastewater dischargers to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow measurement by personnel of the city. This control manhole shall be located so as to provide access at all times to personnel of the city. (Ord. 249 § 708, 1979)
13.32.455 Damage Caused By Wastewater Discharge
Any industrial wastewater discharger whose discharges cause damage to the city’s facilities, detrimental effects on the treatment processes or any other damage resulting in costs, shall be liable to the city for all damages occasioned thereby. (Ord. 249 § 709, 1979)
13.32.460 Industrial Wastewater Sampling, Analyses, And Flow Measurements
A. Measurements. Periodic measurements of flow rates, volumes, BOD, and suspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial wastewater treatment capital charge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary by the director shall be made by all industrial wastewater dischargers, unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the director. The city shall have the option of accepting the metered water consumption as the volume of sewage flow for an industrial discharger or the city may require that an industrial discharger provide, install and maintain in good operating condition an accurate sewage metering device acceptable to the city, at the user’s expense, to permit the determination of the volume of wastewater discharged into the city sewage system. All sampling and analyses of industrial wastewaters shall be performed by a state certified independent laboratory, or by a laboratory of an industrial discharger approved by the director. If performed by a state certified laboratory, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the discharger requesting the tests. Prior to the submittal to the city of the data developed in the laboratory of an industrial discharger, the results shall be verified by a responsible administrative official of the industrial discharger under the penalty of perjury.
B. Analyses. All wastewater analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedure contained in “Standard Methods” prepared and published by the American Public Health Association and others. If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the industry or a procedure judged satisfactory by the director shall be used to measure wastewater constituents. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing tests shall furnish any required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used, if requested to do so by the director.
C. Measurement Devices. All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at the control manhole or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter, or similar device approved by the director and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the director. In lieu of the wastewater flow measurement, the director may accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by suitable factors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial wastewater discharger.
D. Inspections of Measurement Devices. The sampling, analysis, and flow measurement procedures, equipment and results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the city. The sampling and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to authorized personnel.
E. Measurement Frequency. Those industrial wastewater discharges required by the director to make periodic measurements of industrial wastewater flows and constituents shall annually make the minimum number of such measurements required. The minimum requirements for such periodic measurements shall be:
1. A minimum of one twenty-four-hour measurement per year. Representative samples of the industrial wastewaters shall be obtained at least once per hour over the twenty-four-hour period, properly refrigerated, composited according to measured flow rates during the twenty-four hours, and analyzed for the specified wastewater constituents;
2. Dischargers required to sample on only a few days per year shall sample during the periods of highest wastewater flow and wastewater constituent discharges;
3. Industrial plants with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewaters may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for every working day. When required by the director, dischargers shall install and maintain in proper order automatic flow-proportional sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and recording equipment;
4. Measurements to verify the quantities of waste flows and waste constituents reported by industrial dischargers will be conducted on a random basis by personnel of the city. (Ord. 249 § 710, 1979)
13.32.465 Discrepancies Between Actual And Reported Industrial Wastewater Discharge Quantities
Should measurements or other investigations reveal that the industrial discharger is discharging a flow rate or a quantity of biochemical oxygen demand or suspended solids significantly in excess of that stated in the industrial wastewater permit or in excess of the quantities reported to the city by the discharger and upon which the industrial wastewater treatment charges are based, the discharger shall apply for an amended industrial wastewater permit and shall be assessed for all delinquent charges, together with the penalty and interest. Before these charges shall be assessed, at least two additional twenty-four-hour samples and flow measurements shall be obtained by the city with all the costs of sampling and analyses to be paid by the discharger. All expense of determining the need for an amended permit shall be paid by the discharger.
An industrial discharger found in violation shall be presumed in the absence of other evidence, to have been discharging at the determined parameter values over the preceding three years or subsequent to the previous city verification of quantity parameters, whichever period is shorter. (Ord. 249 § 711, 1979)
13.32.470 Pretreatment Of Industrial Wastewater
Pretreatment systems or devices may be required by the director to treat wastewaters prior to discharge to the community sewer when it is necessary to restrict or prevent the discharge to the community sewer of wastewaters having strength in violation of the prohibitions, or exceeding the limits established by this chapter, or to distribute wastewater discharges over a period of time.
All pretreatment systems or devices shall be approved by the director, but such approval shall not relieve a discharger of the responsibility for taking all steps necessary to comply with the wastewater limitations established by the city. All required pretreatment equipment shall be installed and operated at the discharger’s expense. (Ord. 249 § 712, 1979)
13.32.475 Industrial Wastewater Charges
A. General. The capital and interest costs to be charged the user shall be determined by his plant capacity required of each industrial user.
Those industries with grant eligible capacity will pay capital and interest costs based on the original design capacity as stated in the revenue plan approved by the state, unless they exercise their option to make periodic deposits based on their estimated maximum need of the ensuing year with adjustment billings or credits, whichever the case may be, within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year. If an industry elects to pay on its actual required capacity, rather than its grant eligible design capacity, the industry shall lose its rights to the design capacity if its actual required capacity is less than the design, and the city may allocate that excess capacity to other
users. If the industry’s actual capacity is greater than the design capacity, the industry will be required to pay connection charges for the difference of its design capacity and its actual required capacity and the required capacity will establish its plant capacity.
B. Industrial User Rates. Industrial users will be charged the rates stated in any revenue programs as adopted by the council, and will include charges for capital recovery, interest costs, operation and maintenance costs, and administration and collection system costs. The charges shall reflect the user’s contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment works and will recognize volume, BOD and suspended solids to insure a proportional distribution of costs to each user.
C. Billing Period. During each fiscal year, there will be billing periods as determined by the city clerk. The city clerk may divide the annual cost into equal billings and combine the user’s share of operation and maintenance costs, plus any assessment for additional costs caused by the user discharging wastewater in violation of the provisions of this chapter.
D. Due Date for Payment of Charges and Disconnection Following Delinquency. All fees and charges imposed under the provisions of Section 13.32.415 through and including Section 13.32.480 shall be due and payable upon the receipt of the notice of charges. Underpayment charges shall become delinquent thereafter as provided for in Section 13.24.080 and when delinquent shall be subject to the disconnection penalties provided for in Section 13.24.080.
E. Determination of Charges.
1. Capacity. The actual plant capacity for each industrial user will be determined by the highest daily volume, pounds of BOD, and pounds of suspended solids discharged into the sanitary sewer system measured by averaging the highest three consecutive days during the prior fiscal year. The three determining factors for industrial capacity will not necessarily peak during the same period. New industrial users will estimate their plant capacity requirements and make periodic deposits as determined by the director during their first year of operation with an adjustment billing or credit, whichever the case may be, within thirty days after the end of the fiscal year. If the period of operation during the first fiscal year is not sufficient to determine a plant capacity, the second year operation capacity requirements will be used as if the industry was a new user in that year.
2. Actual Discharges. The operation and maintenance costs will be based on the actual volume, pounds of BOD, and suspended solids. It will be the industrial user’s responsibility to provide composite samples of its discharges for determining the BOD and suspended solid testing. Each sample shall be marked with the beginning and ending meter reading of the volume discharge during the period the composite sample is taken. The volume measured by the meter readings and the test results of the composite samples will be used to calculate the pounds of BOD and suspended solids and will be the basis of the billing operation and maintenance charges, If there are time periods when the meter readings of the composite samples are not consecutive, the city, at its sole discretion, will deter mine the parts per million of the BOD and suspended solids for that volume that a sample was not received. (Ord. 331 § 4, 1989; Ord. 320 § 4, 1988; Ord. 249 § 703, 1979)
13.32.480 Special Dumping Permit
Special dumping permits shall be required when any person desires to discharge liquid waste from campers, recreation vehicles, transient mobile homes, transient trailer houses and similar
vehicles directly or indirectly into the sewage facilities of the city. Waste discharged into the city system from such sources shall not consist of septic tank or cesspool contents, industrial wastes and any other wastewater of a nature prohibited by this chapter.
All applicants for a special dumping permit shall construct and maintain a special dumping structure approved by the director and the county health department. Dumping structures shall be constructed at locations approved by the director at the sole cost of the permittee.
The city may require payment for the treatment of such wastes and the applicant shall pay all such costs or the city may refuse permission to discharge certain wastes. A special discharge permit shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. Any person negligently or willfully violating the requirements of the city for such discharges shall be in violation of this chapter and may have his permit revoked by the city council. (Ord. 249 § 714, 1979)

(Ord. 249 § 804, 1979)
13.32.505 Fees—Annexation Charges
The owner or owners of lands within areas proposed to be annexed to the city shall deposit with the city a sum to be fixed by the city council prior to the commencement of proceedings by the city council on the proposed annexation. The amount to be fixed by the city shall be in a sum estimated to equal the engineering, legal and publication costs and all other charges which may be incurred in connection therewith, and any other annexation fees set by the city council. The City Council may from time to time adjust annexation fees charged by resolution. (Ord. 249 § 805, 1979, Ord. 485 § I, 2005)
13.32.510 Fees And Charges
Pursuant to the authority vested in the city council by the terms of Ordinance 249 as amended by Ordinance 282, Ordinance 292 and Ordinance 320, the city council declares as follows:
In addition to any other fees and charges established by the ordinances, rules and regulations of the city, there shall be collected, prior to connection to the sanitary sewage system of the city, the following:
A, Assessment Sewer Extension Charge. For any parcel, unit or lot, or part of said property, lying within the present boundaries of the city or hereafter annexed to the city, which abuts on or can be served by any existing sewer main or other special assessment proceedings, additional connection charges to be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for sewer connection in any such areas, are established as follows:
Assessment sewer extension charges shall be collected in a sum to be computed by the director, as said property share of the cost of the existing sewage facilities of the city to be used by said property. The sum shall be the equivalent of the cost to similar properties within the city which were fully assessed for said facilities so to be used. Said sum must be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for sewer connection and shall include all costs incident to the installation of such facilities, together with interest charges thereon. Properties subject to such additional connection charge include, but are not limited to:
1. Properties outside of the boundaries of assessment proceedings;
2. Properties within the boundaries of an assessment district but against which no assessment was levied; and
3. Properties within the boundaries of an assessment district but against which a partial assessment only was levied on the theory of partial benefit, as for example, in the case of adjoining lots with substandard frontage in common ownership.
B. Special Agreement Sewer Extension Charge. For any parcel, unit or lot, or part of said property which abuts on or can be served by any existing sewer main or other sanitary sewage facilities of the city constructed pursuant to a special agreement, wherein the city has agreed to reimburse to the party making the original installation a share of the cost of original construction attributable to parcels of property later connecting to said main or facilities, special connection charges in addition to any other charges established by the city, which must be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for sewer connection, are established.
A special agreement sewer extension charge shall be collected in a sum to be computed by the director or as said property’s share of the cost of the sewer mains and other sanitary sewage facilities of the city, constructed pursuant to special agreement, to be used by said property. The sum shall be equivalent to the prorata share of the cost of the installation made pursuant to the special agreement which would have been paid by said property for the facilities so to be used if said property had contributed its equitable share to the original cost of construction. Said sum shall include all costs incident to the installation of such mains and facilities.
C. Sewer Extension Charges. Sewer extension charges are for the purpose of reimbursing the city for its costs to extend sewer mains. Before any person may connect to mains which have been extended by the city, after the initial basic city sewer system was installed by the city, they shall pay an extension charge.
The amount of such extension charges which shall be paid prior to the issuance of a permit for sewer connection shall be the sum of eighteen dollars per front foot whether the property be residentially zoned, commercially or industrially zoned.
Such charges are established as a minimum requirement for the extension of a sewer main. Corner lots shall be charged unless otherwise determined as follows:
Existing subdivision lots having more than one street frontage shall pay extension fees based on a total of the lot frontage plus fifty percent of the side street frontage as measured along the property lines and at curves along property lines extended.
New subdivisions, created primarily by parcel maps and developments shall pay extension charges based on all of the frontage, unless otherwise determined by the city council.
For sewer mains serving property on one side only, the cost shall be twice the front footage cost set forth herein.
Owners, subdividers and developers may extend city sewer mains at their expense in accordance with this chapter and in accordance with a reimbursement agreement approved by the city council.
D. Sewer Connection Charges. The sewer connection charge is for recovering from each connection owner his proportionate cost of the sewage system which has been constructed in the city to convey and process wastewater. The connection charge shall be collected as follows:
1. At the time the owner connects to city sewers;
2. Upon altering or expanding existing facilities which change wastewater flows or increase the need for additional facilities.
Charges for sewer connection to city wastewater facilities shall be as follows:
Residential users, single family
$1,300.00
Multiple-family dwellings, each
865.00
Mobile home parks
810.00
Commercial users, lodges, churches, halls
70.00 per fixture unit
Industrial users
A charge equivalent to a single-family rate paid on analysis of flow BOD and suspended solids

If the Director of Public Works has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City of Live Oak designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director of Public Works may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
13.34.430 Confidential Information
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, industrial wastewater discharge permit applications, industrial wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Director of Public Work’s inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Industrial wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent
data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
13.34.440 Publication Of Users In Significant Noncompliance
The Director of Public Works shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of industrial wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of industrial wastewater measurements taken during a six- (6-)month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
B. Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of industrial wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six- (6-)month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other discharge violation that the Director of Public Works believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Director of Public Work’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an industrial wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s) which the Director of Public Works determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
13.34.450 Notification of Violation
When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director of Public Works. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Director of Public Works to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
13.34.460 Consent Orders
The Director of Public Works may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 13.34.480 and 13.34.490 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable.
13.34.470 Show Cause Hearing
The Director of Public Works may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Director of Public Works and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
13.34.480 Compliance Orders
When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
13.34.490 Cease and Desist Orders
When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the Director of Public Works may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
13.34.500 Administrative Fines
A. When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 25 percent (25%) of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 0.83 percent (0.83%) per month. A lien against the user’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
C. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the Director of Public Works to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty (30) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the Director of Public Works may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Director of Public Works may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
13.34.510 Emergency Suspensions
The Director of Public Works may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director of Public Works may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director of Public Works may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, groundwater, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director of Public Works may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 13.34.520 of this chapter are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director of Public
Works prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under Sections 13.34.470 or 13.34.520 of this chapter.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
13.34.520 Termination of Discharge

Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under Section 13.34.470 of this chapter why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director of Public Works shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
13.34.530 Injunctive Relief
When the Director of Public Works finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director of Public Works may petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction through the City’s Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the industrial wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The Director of Public Works may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
13.34.540 Civil Penalties
A. A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City of Live Oak for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per day, In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

13.34.620 Upset
A. For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when the City of Live Oak was regularly in compliance with its Waste Discharge Requirements, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
13.34.640 Bypass
A. For the purposes of this section,
(1) “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.
(2) “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this section.
C. (1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director of Public Works, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of Public Works of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director of Public Works may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
D. (1) Bypass is prohibited, and the Director of Public Works may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
(2) The Director of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director of Public Works determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section.

14.08.010 Findings
The City Council of the City of Live Oak finds and determines as follows:
a. The City wishes to encourage the maintenance of well-kept properties. The City recognizes that property values and the general welfare of the community are founded in large part on the appearance, maintenance and safety of properties.
b. The existence of property in a condition constituting a nuisance as defined in this chapter is injurious to the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City. Such conditions contribute substantially and increasingly to the necessity for excessive expenditures for protection against hazards, diminution of property values, and the preservation of the public health and safety.
c. Public nuisances are those affecting the entire community, neighborhood or a considerable number of people. Under California law, local governments have standing to intercede and to abate a public nuisance.
d. The existence of public nuisances of the type designated and the abatement of these public nuisances, is reasonably related to the proper exercise of the police power in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the public, and the exercise of that power by the city is authorized by the constitution of the state and applicable laws.
e. Unless uniform and expedient corrective measures are available to be undertaken to alleviate such conditions, the public health, safety and general welfare and the property values and social and economic standards of this community will be substantially depreciated. The abatement of such conditions will enhance the appearance and value of such properties and will improve the tax base of the city.
f. It is in the public interest to establish a cost recovery procedure so that the abatement of a public nuisance is at the expense of the person(s) creating, causing, committing or maintaining the nuisance.
g. It is the intent of the City Council of the City of Live Oak in adopting this chapter to provide a comprehensive method for the identification and abatement of certain public nuisances within the City.
h. The provisions of this chapter are supplementary and complementary to all of the provisions of the Live Oak Municipal Code, state law, and any law cognizable at common law or in equity, and nothing herein shall be read, interpreted or construed in any manner so as to limit any existing right or power of the city to abate any and all nuisances. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)

FINANCE OFFICER
City of Live Oak, California
The posting of the finance officer’s report and assessment/lien list and the mailing of notice to property owners as above provided for shall be done at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing scheduled before the City Council.
In every instance where abatement work has been performed at the expense of the city and a billing therefore has been rendered and is past due as of June 1st of any calendar year, the hearing for confirmation thereof shall be held by June 30th of that same calendar year; if the same is past due as of December 1st of any calendar year, the hearing for confirmation thereof shall be held by December 30th of that same calendar year. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)
14.08.170 Hearing and Confirmation
At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the finance officer’s report and assessment/lien list, the city council shall hear the same together with any protests or objections which may be raised or lodged by property owners or other interested persons. Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the city council shall make such corrections or modifications in any proposed costs which it may deem to be excessive or otherwise incorrect after which such costs shall be confirmed by resolution adopted by the City Council. The City Council may delete from the report and cancel any costs found improper or unjustified. The confirmation of the report and costs by the city council shall be final and conclusive.
Upon taking action under subsection (a), the city council may order that the costs of abatement be made a personal obligation of the property owner and either a nuisance abatement lien or a special assessment against the property.
If an action or proceeding is commenced to recover the costs, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, provided that, pursuant to California Government code section 38773.5 attorneys’ fees shall only be available where the city has elected, at the commencement of such action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys’ fees. In no action or proceeding shall an award of attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding.
A nuisance abatement lien may be recorded and enforced against the property pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code section 38773.1. A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the City for a money judgment. As part of the foreclosure action, the city may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs including, but not limited to, costs incurred for processing and recording the lien and providing notice to the property owner.
As an alternative to a nuisance abatement lien, the costs of abatement may be made a special assessment against the property. The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes and shall be subject to the same penalties and procedures, including the sale of the property in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. The special assessment shall continue until the assessment and all interest and penalties due and payable thereon have been paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)
14.08.180 Effect of Assessment and Notice of Lien
It shall be permissible for any person to pay the amount of such assessment that has been imposed for nuisance abatement within fifteen (15) days following the date of adoption of the city council resolution confirming the assessment/lien. If the assessment/lien is not paid on or before said date, the total amount thereof shall be entered on the next succeeding fiscal year’s secured tax roll of Sutter County for that property, and the assessment shall thereupon become a lien against the property, and the amount of the assessment shall be collected at the time and in the manner of ordinary municipal taxes. The lien of the assessment shall have the priority of the taxes with which it is collected. If delinquent, the amount is subject to the same penalties and procedures of foreclosure and sale provided for ordinary municipal taxes.
If the property is owned by a public agency of the local, state or federal government, the assessment shall not be entered on the County tax roll, but rather collected in the same manner as other unsecured obligations due and owing to the City.
Further, if the assessment is not paid within fifteen (15) days following the date of adoption of the city council resolution confirming it, the city manager may prepare and cause to be recorded in the office of the County Recorder a notice of lien, which shall be in form approved by the city attorney, and from the time of recording the notice of lien, the amount of the assessment shall be and constitute a lien upon the property having the force and effect of a judgment lien until released and discharged, or otherwise extinguished in the manner provided by law. When the assessment is paid, the city manager shall promptly deliver to the person or persons entitled thereto a release of lien, which shall be in a form approved by the city attorney, which may be recorded by such person or persons to extinguish the lien on the property. The city manager shall not record a notice of lien against the property owned by a public agency of the local, state or federal government. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)
14.08.190 Collection of Assessment and Transfer to Unsecured Roll
If any real property to which the lien provided for in Section 14.08.180 would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if the lien of a bona fide purchaser for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of such taxes levied for municipal purposes would become delinquent, then the lien which would otherwise be imposed by this chapter shall not attach to such real property, and the costs of abatement as confirmed relating to such property shall be transferred to the unsecured tax roll for collection. In such event, the city may notify the appropriate County officials that it will undertake collection of the amount owing from the property owner or owners at the time the abatement work was actually performed utilizing collection procedures applied with respect to other unsecured obligations due the city. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)
14.08.200 Time for Contest of Assessment
The validity of any costs, assessment or lien made under the provisions of this chapter shall not be contested in any action or proceeding unless the same is commenced within thirty (30) days after the cost, assessment or lien is confirmed by the city council. (Ord. 519 §1, 2009)
14.08.210 Judicial Enforcement
In addition to, or as an alternative to the proceedings set forth elsewhere in this Chapter, the City Attorney may seek judicial enforcement of this Chapter which may include, but not be limited to the following:
a. Enforcement of the City’s building or other local ordinances by way injunction, including contempt proceedings for the violation of any such injunction;
b. The imposition of civil penalties.

15.21.030 Statement Of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to:
(a) Protect human life and health;

(c) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(d) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(f) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;
(g) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and,

(jj) "Fraud and Victimization" as related to Sections 15.21.240 through 15.21.280 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of Live Oak will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below
the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates.

(oo) "Hardship" as related to Sections 15.21.240 through 15.21.280 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The County of Sutter requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
(pp) "Highest Adjacent Grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.

(vv) “Lowest Floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see “Basement” definition). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to:
(1) The flood openings standard in Section 15.21.180 (C);
(2) The anchoring standards in Section 15.21.160;
(3) The construction materials and methods standard in Section 15.21.170; and

(ppp) "Start of Construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days from the date of the permit.
The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
(qqq) "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.
(rrr) "Substantial Damage" means:
(1) Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or

This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
(1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or,
(2) Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
(ttt) "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.
(uuu) “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

The floodplain administrator shall make the final determination whether a conveyance or other topographic feature constitutes a watercourse. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.050 Lands to Which This Chapter Applies
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards and local flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Live Oak. The area of applicability of this chapter may be supplemented by the Floodplain Administrator based upon the best available information, which may include any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, other flooding studies, measured high water elevations from historic flooding events, local topography, or other available information. These areas shall be referred to as local flood hazard areas. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.060 Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Live Oak, California” dated March 23, 1984 , with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), dated March 23, 1984 and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City Council by the Floodplain Administrator.
The FIS and FIRMs are on file at 9955 Live Oak Boulevard, Live Oak, and Ca. 95953 . (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.070 Enforcement
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.080 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.090 Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:
(a) Considered as minimum requirements;
(b) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
(c) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.100 Application to Government Agencies
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all government agencies and local agencies, their officers, employees, or agents, to the extent authorized by law. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.110 Designation of the Floodplain Administrator
The Chief Building Official is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.120 Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator
The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(a) Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine:
(1) Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures;
(2) All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
(3) The site is reasonably safe from flooding;
(4) The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will neither increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Live Oak nor adversely affect adjacent property owners; and,
(5) All Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building Permits shall not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition.
(b) Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage. The City shall utilize FEMA publication FEMA 213, “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,” for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage.
(c) Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided within the current “Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Live Oak, California or accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer provisions relating to Flood Hazard Reduction. This responsibility for reasonable review does not relieve the responsibility or liability of a registered engineer who develops base flood elevations for use in an approximate Zone A area. A base flood elevation shall be developed using the detailed methods as described in the most current edition of FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations”. The simplified methods presented in FEMA 265 are not sufficient for completing an Elevation Certificate.
(d) Notification of Other Agencies.
(1) Alteration or relocation of a watercourse:
(i) Notify affected communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation;
(ii) Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and,
(iii) Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained.
(2) Base Flood Elevation changes due to physical alterations:
(i) Within 6 months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
(ii) All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building Permits shall not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the “start of construction” definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data.
(3) Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits.
(e) Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following:
(1) Certification required by the City of Live Oak Municipal Code Section 15.21.180 (a) (elevation or floodproofing of residential structures);
(2) Certification required by the City of Live Oak Municipal Code Section 15.21.180 (b) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);
(3) Certification required by the City of Live Oak Municipal Code Sections 15.21.180 (c) (flood openings standard);
(4) Certification required by the City of Live Oak Municipal Code Section 15.21.200 (a) (3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards);
(5) Certification required by the City of Live Oak Municipal Code Section 15.21.210 (c) (standards for manufactured homes);
(6) Certification required by Section 15.21.230 (b) (floodways); and
(7) Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(f) Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this chapter.
(g) Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in this Floodplain Management Ordinance.
(h) Biennial Report. Complete and submit Biennial Report to FEMA.
(i) Planning. Assure community’s General Plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.130 Scope
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and,
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)

(e) All appropriate certifications listed in the City’s Floodplain Management Ordinance. All new construction, substantial improvement and/or lateral additions shall require submittal of a National Flood Insurance Program – Elevation Certificate.
(f) For improvements and repairs to existing structures with the lowest floor below the BFE in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), applicant must provide evidence that such proposed improvements or repairs do not constitute substantial improvements or repairs to the structure prior to obtaining a building permit. For repairs to structures damaged by flood, fire or other disasters, such evidence must be in accordance with FEMA 213: “Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings.” (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.150 Standards for Construction
All new construction or substantial improvement within special flood hazard areas and/or local flood hazard areas shall comply with the standards set forth in Sections 15.21.160 through 15.21.230. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.160 Anchoring
All new construction and substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part), 2010)
15.21.170 Construction Materials And Methods
All new construction and substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be constructed:
(1) With flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage for areas less than one foot above the base flood elevation;
(2) Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage;
(3) With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and
(4) Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures.
(5) If fill is placed at a site to elevate a building pad above the base flood elevation, then buildings constructed within flood hazard areas must be constructed on compacted fill in accordance with the Construction Specifications or at least 90% density per ASTM-D1557 (known as Modified Proctor) and extending at least five feet beyond the building foundation walls before dropping below the base flood elevation and shall include appropriate protection from erosion and scour. The design of the fill must be approved by a registered professional engineer. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.180 Elevation And Floodproofing
(a) Residential Construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement:
(1) In AE, AH, A1-30 Zones, elevated at least one foot above the BFE.
(2) In an AO Zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least one foot, or elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.
(3) In an A Zone, without BFE’s specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A zone], elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation as determined by methods comparable to those in a Flood Insurance Study or by using the detailed methods as described in the most current edition of FEMA publication, FEMA 265, “Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas – A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations” or any successor FEMA document.
(4) In all other Zones and in local flood hazard areas, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map or one foot above the locally-determined base flood elevation if that elevation is higher. In Zone X, a condition of granting any building permit for construction outside a subdivision shall be that the lowest floor shall be placed at an elevation, as determined by a registered engineer, which will protect the
structure from inundation as a result of a storm with a 100-year recurrence interval. If the Floodplain Administrator determines that developing data to establish the 100-year storm inundation elevation would be excessively expensive, the Floodplain Administrator may alternatively approve a lowest floor elevation which is one foot above the centerline of the closest city street at a point closest to the building site. This requirement shall exclude detached garages, accessory buildings and agricultural shops, provided that the owner signs an indemnity agreement for any future damages by flooding.
Certification and verification of building elevations shall be in the form of a National Flood Insurance Program – Elevation Certificate. At first form inspection, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the City of Live Oak Building Inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
(b) Nonresidential Construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform to Section 15.21.180(a) or:
(1) Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the elevation recommended under Section 15.21.180 (a), so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
(2) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(3) Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that the standards of Section 15.21.160 & Section 15.21.170 are satisfied.

15.21.220 Standards For Recreational Vehicles
All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either:
(a) Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
(b) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use or meet the permit requirements of Section 15.21.140 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.21.210.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.230 Nature Of Variances
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance.
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.
The need to protect citizens from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter shall be quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.240 Conditions For Variances
(a) Variances to allow wet floodproofing of new or substantially improved non- residential structures may be issued for the following categories of Structures:
? Structures functionally dependent upon close proximity to water;
? Accessory Structures used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds); and
? Agricultural structures used exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting, storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising of livestock.
(b) Variances may also be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.21.040 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(c) Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. The Floodplain Administrator may record a copy of the notice in the Office of the Sutter County Recorder which shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
(f) The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.250 City Council Guidelines
(a) In passing upon requests for variances, the Live Oak City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the:
(1) Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(2) Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;
(4) Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(5) Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
(6) Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(8) Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
(9) Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(10) Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and,
(11) Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon a:
(1) Showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and
(3) Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause “fraud and victimization” of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.
(c) Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.21.260(a) through 15.21.260(d) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.
(d) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.21.250(a) and the purposes of this chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.260 Appeals
The City Council of the City of Live Oak shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.270 Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Live Oak, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)
15.21.280 Severability
This chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 524 § 1 (part) 2010)

B. If the committee is satisfied that the proposed construction or alteration will not materially impair the historic or architectural value of the structure, it shall approve the application for permit.
C. If the committee finds that the retention of the structure constitutes a hazard to public safety and the hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means available to the owner, the committee shall approve the application for demolition.
D. If the committee considers the structure valuable for the period of architecture it represents and important to the neighborhood in which it exists, the committee may nevertheless approve the application if any of the following circumstances exist:
1. The structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which substantially benefits the city; and/or
2. Retention of the structure is not in the interest of the majority of inhabitants of the city.
E. The committee may approve the moving of a structure of historical or architectural value as an alternative to demolition. (Ord. 424 § 1 (part), 1995, Ord. 514 §1, 2008)
15.43.130 Limitation On Applications

Chapter 15.50 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
Sections:
15.50.010 Purpose.
15.50.020 Development impact fee.
15.50.030 Limited use of development impact fees.
15.50.010 Purpose
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the Live Oak General Plan, to maintain existing levels of service, and to mitigate the impacts on city streets, parks, and governmental, police and fire facilities caused by anticipated new development within the city, certain public improvements must be constructed as development occurs. The city council of the city has determined that a development impact fee is needed to finance these necessary public improvements and to pay a fair share of acquisition and improvement costs and other costs necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the Live Oak General Plan and to maintain levels of service consistent with levels of service now enjoyed by citizens of the city. The city council has determined that the application of the fee is consistent with the city’s general plan and, pursuant to Section 65913.2 of the Government Code of the state of California, has considered the effects of the fee on meeting the city’s housing needs as established in the housing element and other elements of the city’s General Plan. (Ord. 381 § 3 (part), 1992)
15.50.020 Development Impact Fee
A. A development impact fee is established on issuance of all permits entitling construction of, or remodeling for change of use to create new residential units and new non-residential facilities within the city, to pay for costs of improvements necessitated thereby as described in Section 15.50.010. The city council shall, by ordinance, set forth the specific amount of the fee to be imposed, describe the benefit of the improvements required, list the specific public improvements to be financed, describe the estimated cost of the facilities and identify the reasonable relationship between the fee and different types of new development. After the development impact fee has been established by ordinance, the city council may from time to time adjust the development impact fee by resolution. The development impact fee shall be paid by the developer or owner prior to the issuance of a building permit. The city council may review the fees on an annual basis to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the burden of developments and whether the identified public facilities continue to be needed to serve the purposes identified in Section 15.50.010 above.
B. The development impact fees imposed by this chapter are independent of and not related to existing city capacity and connection fees or fees collected for acquisition of park land pursuant to other sections of this code.
C. The city council has determined, based on a study and analysis in accordance with Government Code Section 66000 et. seq. and following, that: a. projected new development will, create a demand for additional public improvements, facilities and equipment to serve that new development at the same level of service enjoyed by current development in the city; b. a direct relationship exists between the needed additional public improvements, facilities and equipment and the new development and; c. estimated costs of the necessary public improvements, facilities and equipment to serve the new development are reasonable.
D. The City Council finds as follows:
1. The purpose of the development impact fees is to offset costs of remodeling, adding to or replacing existing facilities to meet the demands of additional development and growth.
2. The development impact fees will be used specifically for the purposes outlined in the attached report entitled City of Live Oak AB1600 Development Impact Fee Analysis dated March 15, 2011 as amended and attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
3. The development impact fees will only be applied where there is a reasonable relationship between the land use and the public improvement or facility as described in the attached report cited above.
4. The reasonable relationship between the need for the facilities to be funded by the fees and the specific development upon which the fees are imposed is as described in the attached report cited above.
5. The reasonable relationship between the amount of the fees and the cost of the public facilities or portion thereof attributable to the development affected is as described in the attached report cited above.
6. The proposed development impact fees have been considered; relative to their impact upon meeting the city’s housing needs.
7. The proposed transportation fee for the commercial category of non-residential development should be phased in to encourage commercial development. The proposed fee should be reduced by 45% from $14,197 to $7,808 for the transportation fee for the commercial category of non-residential development only. This temporary reduction may be reviewed at any time to determine if any adjustment is necessary based on the overall economic conditions of the city and the reduced fee may be adjusted from time to time by resolution of the city council.
8. The development impact fees shall be rounded up to the nearest whole dollar.
9. The development impact fees will be collected prior to the issuance of a building permit.
10. The City Council may from time to time adjust the development impact fees by resolution.
11. The development impact fees will be adjusted upward annually by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers, San Francisco All Items.

16.18.100 Action on a Final Map by the City Engineer
Upon receipt of the final map the City Engineer shall examine such to determine that the subdivision is shown substantially the same as it appeared on the tentative map, any approved alteration thereof, and any conditions of approval thereof, that all provisions of this Title and the Subdivision Map Act have been complied with, and that the map is technically correct. If the City Engineer determines that the final map is not in full conformity with the tentative map, the subdivider shall be advised of the changes or additions that must be made to make such conformity, and shall afford the subdivider an opportunity to make such changes or additions. If the City Engineer determines that full conformity therein has been made, it shall be so stated on the final map and transmitted to the City Clerk, together with any documents which may have been filed therewith for presentation to the City Council. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.18.110 Filing Certificate Regarding a Tax Lien

16.18.120 Approval by the City Council
The City Council shall, at the meeting at which it receives the final map or, at its next regular meeting after the meeting at which it receives the final map, approve the final map if it conforms to all of the requirements of this Title and the Subdivision Map Act applicable at the time of approval or conditional approval of the tentative map and any rulings made thereafter.

In such a case the City Engineer shall review the altered map for conformance with the requirements of the City Council and then shall submit the altered map to the City Council for its approval along with a statement that the altered final map is technically correct. No final map shall have any force or effect until the same has been approved by the City Council and no offer of dedication shall be accepted until the City Clerk has recorded the final map with the Sutter County Recorder. The provisions of this Section may be waived when the failure of the final map is a result of a technical error which, in the determination of the City, does not materially affect the validity of the final map. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.18.140 Public Improvement Agreement
If at the time of approval of the final map by the City Council, any public improvements required by the City pursuant to the provisions of this Title have not been completed and accepted in accordance with City standards applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map, the City Council, as a condition precedent to the approval of the final map, shall require the subdivider to enter into an agreement with the City upon mutually agreeable terms to thereafter complete the improvements at the subdivider’s expense. Such agreement shall be secured by improvement security. The agreement may, at the option of the City, be recorded. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.18.150 Type of Improvement Security Allowed
A. Types of security permitted: Whenever this Title authorizes or requires the furnishing of security in connection with the performance of any act or agreement, such security shall be one of the following at the option of and subject to approval by the City:
1. Bond: A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum Best Rating of “A”;
2. Cash deposit: A deposit, either with the City or a responsible escrow agent or trust company, at the option of the City, or money or negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposits of public moneys;
3. Instrument of credit: An instrument of credit from one or more financial institutions subject to regulation by the state or federal government and pledging that the funds necessary to carry out the act or agreement are in deposit and guaranteed for payment;
4. Property lien: A lien upon the property to be divided, created by a contract between the owner and the City, if the City finds that it would not be in the public interest to require the installation of the required improvement sooner than two years after recordation of the map; or
5. Real property interest: A security interest in real property in an amount determined by the City not to exceed a portion of the value of the property as determined by the City. The security interest instrument would be of a form approved by the City, and would be recorded by the Sutter County Recorder. From the time of recordation of the written contract or document creating a security interest, a lien shall attach to the real property particularly described therein and shall have the priority of a judgment lien in the amount necessary to complete the agreed improvements. The recorded contract or security document shall be indexed in the grantor index to the names of all record owners of the real property and in the grantee index to the City of Live Oak.
B. Release of security: The City may at anytime release all or any portion of the property subject to any lien or security interest created by this subdivision or subordinate the lien or security interest to other liens or encumbrances if it determines that security for performance is sufficiently secured by a lien on other property or that the release or subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the completion of the agreed upon improvements. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.18.160 Bonded Security
A. Form:
1. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum A rating to secure faithful performance shall be in substantially the following form:
Whereas, the City Council of the City of Live Oak, State of California, and _____________________ (hereinafter designated as “principal”) have entered into an agreement whereby principal agrees to install and complete certain designated public improvements, which said agreement, dated _______________, 20__, and identified as project ______________, is hereby referred to and made a part of; and
Whereas, said principal is required under the terms of said agreement to furnish a bond for the faithful performance of said agreement.
Now, therefore, we, the principal and ________________________, as surety, are held and firmly bound unto the City of Live Oak (hereinafter called the “City”), in the penal
sum of __________________ dollars ($____________) lawful money of the United States, for the payment of which sum and well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves, our heirs, successors, executors and administrators, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.
The condition of this obligation is such that if the above bounded principal, his or its heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns, shall in all things stand to and abide by, and well and truly keep and perform the covenants, conditions and provisions in the said agreement and any alteration thereof made as therein provided, on his or their part, to be kept and performed at the time and in the manner therein specified, and in all respects according to their true intent and meaning, and shall indemnify and save harmless the City of Live Oak, its officers, agents and employees, as therein stipulated, then this obligation shall become null and void; otherwise it shall be and remain in full force and effect.
As a part of the obligation secured hereby and in addition to the face amount specified therefore, there shall be included costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the City in successfully enforcing such obligation, all to be taxed as costs and included in any judgment rendered.
The surety hereby stipulates and agrees that no change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the agreement or to the work to be performed thereunder or the specifications accompanying the same shall in anywise affect its obligations on this bond, and it does hereby waive notice of any such change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the agreement or to the work or to the specifications.
The surety’s obligations to the City arise immediately upon the default of the principal, without demand or notice. The surety waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 2845 and, in light of such waiver, the City shall not be required to proceed against the principal, nor shall the City be required to pursue any other remedy in the City’s power. In light of such waiver, the City may proceed directly against the Surety upon default of the principal, and it shall not be a defense to the City’s claims against the surety that the City has failed to proceed against the principal (or any other person whom the surety believes might be responsible for the breach of the principal) or to pursue any other remedy in the City’s power. In addition to the foregoing, the surety waives any rights or defenses it may have in respect to its obligations as a surety by reason of any election of remedies by the City.
To the extent that the principal’s obligations are secured by real property or an estate for years, the surety waives all rights and defenses that it may have because the principal’s obligation is so secured. This means, among other things: (1) the City may collect from the surety without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the principal; (2) if the City forecloses on any real property collateral pledges by the principal: (A) the amount of the obligation may be reduced only by the price for which the collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price (B) the City may collect from the surety even if the City, by foreclosing on the real property collateral has destroyed any rights the surety may have to collect from the principal. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses that the surety may have because the principal’s obligation is secured by real property. These
rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 1080a, 1080b, 1080d or 726 of the Code of Civil Procedures.
The surety waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the City, even though that election of remedies, such as a non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation has destroyed the sureties rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure, or otherwise.
Because the surety’s obligations to the City are absolute and unconditional upon default of the principal, it shall be no defense to the surety’s obligations to the City that the principal is or has become insolvent or that the project which is the subject of the principal’s obligations is or has become economically infeasible. In that regard, doctrines such as “Frustration of Purpose” or “Commercial Frustration” or “Illegal Forfeiture” or similar doctrines shall not defeat the surety’s absolute and unconditional obligation to the City upon the default of the principal. The surety has specifically undertaken the risks that the principal may be or become insolvent or that the project which is subject of the principal’s obligation may presently or in the future, lack commercial viability.
In the event the principal defaults in the performance of its obligations, the surety may elect, either directly or through appropriate contractors to perform in the place of the principal. If the surety elects to proceed in this fashion, it shall provide written notice of such election to the City within thirty (30) days after surety becomes aware of the principal’s default. If the surety elects to complete the obligations of the principal (as opposed to paying money damages to the City occasioned by such breach) the surety shall cause the obligations of the principal to be performed as soon as is reasonably possible, but in no event later than nine (9) months following knowledge of the breach by the principal. In the event the surety elects to perform the principal’s obligations, the City shall be entitled to compel the surety, by way of specific performance, to perform such obligations.
If the surety does not elect to perform the principal’s obligations, the surety shall deposit with the City a sum equal to the cost of the uncompleted portion of the work which comprises the principal’s obligation. The City’s City Engineer shall determine the estimated cost of the uncompleted portion of the work and the surety shall make such deposit with the City within five (5) days of receipt of the City Engineer’s estimate. The City shall not be required to expend any of its own funds to complete the work nor to incur “out of pocket” damages inasmuch as the City’s damages are measured by the value of its unfulfilled right, namely the costs of completing the obligations of the principal by installing the bargained-for improvements. Upon deposit of the estimated cost of completion with the City, the City may proceed to bid the remainder of the work as a public project pursuant to the Public Contract Code and the surety shall be obligated to continue to deposit such additional funds as may be necessary from time-to-time until the improvements are complete and accepted by the City or until the surety has exhausted the penal sum of the bond. Should the surety deposit more funds than are necessary to satisfy the principal’s obligation, then the City shall refund any balance remaining upon final acceptance of the improvements. No interest shall be paid on any deposits made with the City.
Underwriting assumptions and cost estimates of the Surety shall not have any bearing, whatsoever, on the Surety’s liability under this bond. By way of example, if, when making underwriting decisions regarding issuing this bond, a cost estimate was prepared regarding the principal’s obligations to the City, the fact that an item was omitted from the cost estimate (which item was an obligation of the principal to the City), shall in no way defeat or diminish the Surety’s obligation to the City with respect to this omitted item. By way of further example, if the underwriting decision to issue this bond included a cost estimate of items and a particular item was estimated at a cost significantly less than the amount actually required to perform such item, this fact shall in no way defeat or diminish the Surety’s obligation to the City. Namely, the Surety shall be obligated to the full amount of the penal sum of the bond, with respect to all matters which are the principal’s obligation to the City, whether such items are actually included in any cost estimate (or if so included, are estimated at a cost far less than the actual cost to perform such items). Likewise, the adequacy and amount of any premium (and whether or not such premium was sufficient for the risk assumed by Surety) shall have no bearing on surety’s absolute and unconditional obligation to the City upon the principal’s default of its obligation under this bond.
In witness whereof, this instrument has been duly executed by the principal and surety above named, on ____________________, 20__.
2. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum A rating for the security of laborers and material men shall be substantially the form prescribed by the Subdivision Map Act.
B. Amount:
1. Performance: For faithful performance the amount of improvement security shall be based upon the total estimated cost of the improvements as determined by the City Engineer. Improvement security securing faithful performance of all work, including sufficient funds to insure construction staking and contract administration by the subdivider’s consulting engineer shall be an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of improvement. All improvement security shall be maintained in full force and effect for a period of 12 months following acceptance of all improvements by the City to assure the proper completion or maintenance of the work; provided that substitution or partial release of security may be authorized by the City Engineer if in the City Engineer’s opinion such substitution or partial release is consistent with the proper completion or maintenance of the work and protection of possible lien holder, and further provided, that the amount of the continuing security shall in no case be less than 25 percent of the amount of the original security.
2. Labor and material: For labor and material the improvement security securing payment to the contractor, their subcontractor and persons furnishing labor, materials and equipment to them for the improvement of the performance of the required act shall be an amount equal to 100 percent of the total estimated cost of the improvement, except if the security is in the form of a cash deposit, deposits or instrument of credit or security interests, the amount shall be equal to 50 percent of the total estimated cost of the improvement. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.18.170 General Conditions for Security and Insurance
A. General Conditions: Bonds, deposits, instruments of credit, property liens and security interest in real property shall conform to the following conditions:

Subdivider’s failure to record a parcel map within a period of 24 months after the approval or conditional approval of the tentative parcel map and any extensions of time granted in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 16.14 of this Title shall terminate all proceedings. Before a parcel map may thereafter be recorded, a new tentative parcel map shall be submitted and approved, as provided in Chapter 16.14. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(G), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.090 Action on a Parcel Map by the City Engineer
Upon receipt of the parcel map the City Engineer shall examine such to determine that the parcel map is shown substantially the same as it appeared on the tentative parcel map, any approved alteration thereof, and any conditions of approval thereof, that all provisions of this Title and the Subdivision Map Act have been complied with, and that the map is technically correct. If the City Engineer determines that the parcel map is not in full conformity with the tentative parcel map, the subdivider shall be advised of the changes or additions that must be made to make such conformity, and shall afford the subdivider an opportunity to make such changes or additions. If the City Engineer determines that full conformity therein has been made, it shall be so stated on the parcel map and transmitted to the City Clerk, together with any documents which may have been filed therewith for presentation to the City Council. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(H), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.100 Filing Certificate Regarding a Tax Lien
Prior to filing the parcel map with the City Council, the subdivider shall file the certificate and documents relating to taxes and assessments, as required by the Subdivision Map Act commencing with Section 66492 and any amendments thereto. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(I), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.110 Approval by the City Council
The City Council shall, at the meeting at which it receives the parcel map or, at its next regular meeting after the meeting at which it receives the parcel map, approve the parcel map if it conforms to all of the requirements of this Title and the Subdivision Map Act applicable at the time of approval or conditional approval of the tentative map and any rulings made thereafter. If the parcel map does not conform the City Council shall deny the parcel map, as provided in Section16.20.100. The meeting at which the City Council receives the parcel map shall be the date on which the City Clerk receives the map. At the time the City Council approves a parcel map, it may also accept, accept subject to improvements or reject any offer of dedication. The City Clerk shall certify on the parcel map the action by the City Council. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(J), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.120 Disapproval by the City Council
The City Council shall disapproval the parcel map if the parcel map fails to meet or perform any of the requirements or conditions imposed by this Title or the Subdivision Map Act applicable at the time of approval or conditional approval of the tentative map and any rulings made thereafter, specifying the requirements or conditions which have not been met or performed. The City Clerk shall advise the subdivider of such disapproval. Within 30 days after the City Council has disapproved any parcel map, the subdivider may file with the City Clerk a map altered to meet the approval of the City Council. In such a case the City Engineer shall review the altered map for conformance with the requirements of the City Council and then shall submit the altered map to the City Council for its approval along with a statement that the altered final map is technically correct. No parcel map shall have any force or effect until the same has been approved by the City Council and no offer of dedication shall be accepted until the City Clerk has recorded the parcel map with the Sutter County Recorder. The provisions of this Section may be waived when the denial of the parcel map is a result of a technical error which, in the determination of the City, does not materially affect the validity of the parcel map. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(K), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.130 Public Improvement Agreement
If at the time of approval of the parcel map by the City Council, any public improvements required by the City pursuant to the provisions of this Title have not been completed and accepted in accordance with City standards applicable at the time of approval of the tentative map, the City Council, as a condition precedent to the approval of the parcel map, shall require the subdivider to enter into an agreement with the City upon mutually agreeable terms to thereafter complete the improvements at the subdivider’s expense. Such agreement shall be secured by improvement security. The agreement may, at the option of the City, be recorded.
(Ord. 254 § 6.2(L), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.140 Type of Improvement Security Allowed
A. Types of security permitted: Whenever this Title authorizes or requires the furnishing of security in connection with the performance of any act or agreement, such security shall be one of the following at the option of and subject to approval by the City:
1. Bond: A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum Best Rating of “A”,
2. Cash deposit: A deposit, either with the City or a responsible escrow agent or trust company, at the option of the City, or money or negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposits of public moneys;
3. Instrument of credit: An instrument of credit from one or more financial institutions subject to regulation by the state or federal government and pledging that the funds necessary to carry out the act or agreement are in deposit and guaranteed for payment;
4. Property lien: A lien upon the property to be divided, created by a contract between the owner and the local agency, if the City finds that it would not be in the public interest to require the installation of the required improvement sooner than two years after recordation of the map; or
5. Real property interest: A security interest in real property in an amount determined by the City not to exceed a portion of the value of the property as determined by the City. The security interest instrument would be of a form approved by the City, and would be recorded by the Sutter County Recorder. From the time of recordation of the written contract or document creating a security interest, a lien shall attach to the real property particularly described therein and shall have the priority of a judgment lien in the amount necessary to complete the agreed improvements. The recorded contract or security document shall be indexed in the grantor index to the names of all record owners of the real property and in the grantee index to the City of Live Oak.
B. Release of security: The City may at anytime release all or any portion of the property subject to any lien or security interest created by this parcel map or subordinate the lien or security interest to other liens or encumbrances if it determines that security for performance is sufficiently secured by a lien on other property or that the release or subordination of the lien will not jeopardize the completion of the agreed upon improvements. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(M), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.150 Bonded Security
A. Form:
1. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum A rating to secure faithful performance shall be in substantially the following form:
Whereas, the City Council of the City of Live Oak, State of California, and _____________________ (hereinafter designated as “principal”) have entered into an agreement whereby principal agrees to install and complete certain designated public improvements, which said agreement, dated _______________, 20__, and identified as project ______________, is hereby referred to and made a part of; and
Whereas, said principal is required under the terms of said agreement to furnish a bond for the faithful performance of said agreement.
Now, therefore, we, the principal and ________________________, as surety, are held and firmly bound unto the City of Live Oak (hereinafter called the “City”), in the penal sum of __________________ dollars ($____________) lawful money of the United States, for the payment of which sum well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves, our heirs, successors, executors and administrators, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.
The condition of this obligation is such that if the above bounded principal, his or its heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns, shall in all things stand to and abide by, and well and truly keep and perform the covenants, conditions and provisions in the said agreement and any alteration thereof made as therein provided, on his or their part, to be kept and performed at the time and in the manner therein specified, and in all respects according to their true intent and meaning, and shall indemnify and save harmless the City of Live Oak, its officers, agents and employees, as therein stipulated, then this obligation shall become null and void; otherwise it shall be and remain in full force and effect.
As a part of the obligation secured hereby and in addition to the face amount specified therefore, there shall be included costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the City in successfully enforcing such obligation, all to be taxed as costs and included in any judgment rendered.
The surety hereby stipulates and agrees that no change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the agreement or to the work to be performed thereunder or the specifications accompanying the same shall in anywise affect its obligations on this bond, and it does hereby waive notice of any such change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the agreement or to the work or to the specifications.
The surety’s obligations to the City arise immediately upon the default of the principal, without demand or notice. The surety waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 2845 and, in light of such waiver, the City shall not be required to proceed against the principal, nor shall the City be required to pursue any other remedy in the City’s power. In light of such waiver, the City may proceed directly against the Surety upon default of the principal, and it shall not be a defense to the City’s claims against the surety that the City has failed to proceed against the principal (or any other person whom the surety believes might be responsible for the breach of the principal) or to pursue any other remedy in the City’s power. In addition to the foregoing, the surety waives any rights or defenses it may have in respect to its obligations as a surety by reason of any election of remedies by the City.
To the extent that the principal’s obligations are secured by real property or an estate for years, the surety waives all rights and defenses that it may have because the principal’s obligation is so secured. This means, among other things: (1) the City may collect from the surety without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the principal; (2) if the City forecloses on any real property collateral pledges by the principal: (A) the amount of the obligation may be reduced only by the price for which the collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price (B) the City may collect from the surety even if the City, by foreclosing on the real
property collateral has destroyed any rights the surety may have to collect from the principal. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses that the surety may have because the principal’s obligation is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 1080a, 1080b, 1080d or 726 of the Code of Civil Procedures.
The surety waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the City, even though that election of remedies, such as a non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation has destroyed the sureties rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d of the Code of Civil Procedure, or otherwise.
Because the surety’s obligations to the City are absolute and unconditional upon default of the principal, it shall be no defense to the surety’s obligations to the City that the principal is or has become insolvent or that the project which is the subject of the principal’s obligations is or has become economically infeasible. In that regard, doctrines such as “Frustration of Purpose” or “Commercial Frustration” or “Illegal Forfeiture” or similar doctrines shall not defeat the surety’s absolute and unconditional obligation to the City upon the default of the principal. The surety has specifically undertaken the risks that the principal may be or become insolvent or that the project which is subject of the principal’s obligation may presently or in the future, lack commercial viability.
In the event the principal defaults in the performance of its obligations, the surety may elect, either directly or through appropriate contractors to perform in the place of the principal. If the surety elects to proceed in this fashion, it shall provide written notice of such election to the City within thirty (30) days after surety becomes aware of the principal’s default. If the surety elects to complete the obligations of the principal (as opposed to paying money damages to the City occasioned by such breach) the surety shall cause the obligations of the principal to be performed as soon as is reasonably possible, but in no event later than nine (9) months following knowledge of the breach by the principal. In the event the surety elects to perform the principal’s obligations, the City shall be entitled to compel the surety, by way of specific performance, to perform such obligations.
If the surety does not elect to perform the principal’s obligations, the surety shall deposit with the City a sum equal to the cost of the uncompleted portion of the work which comprises the principal’s obligation. The City’s City Engineer shall determine the estimated cost of the uncompleted portion of the work and the surety shall make such deposit with the City within five (5) days of receipt of the City Engineer’s estimate. The City shall not be required to expend any of its own funds to complete the work nor to incur “out of pocket” damages inasmuch as the City’s damages are measured by the value of its unfulfilled right, namely the costs of completing the obligations of the principal by installing the bargained-for improvements. Upon deposit of the estimated cost of completion with the City, the City may proceed to bid the remainder of the work as a public project pursuant to the Public Contract Code and the surety shall be obligated to continue to deposit such additional funds as may be necessary from time-to-time until the improvements are complete and accepted by the City or until the surety has exhausted the penal sum of the bond. Should the surety deposit more funds than are necessary to satisfy the principal’s obligation, then the City shall refund any balance remaining upon final
acceptance of the improvements. No interest shall be paid on any deposits made with the City.
Underwriting assumptions and cost estimates of the Surety shall not have any bearing, whatsoever, on the Surety’s liability under this bond. By way of example, if, when making underwriting decisions regarding issuing this bond, a cost estimate was prepared regarding the principal’s obligations to the City, the fact that an item was omitted from the cost estimate (which item was an obligation of the principal to the City), shall in no way defeat or diminish the Surety’s obligation to the City with respect to this omitted item. By way of further example, if the underwriting decision to issue this bond included a cost estimate of items and a particular item was estimated at a cost significantly less than the amount actually required to perform such item, this fact shall in no way defeat or diminish the Surety’s obligation to the City. Namely, the Surety shall be obligated to the full amount of the penal sum of the bond, with respect to all matters which are the principal’s obligation to the City, whether such items are actually included in any cost estimate (or if so included, are estimated at a cost far less than the actual cost to perform such items). Likewise, the adequacy and amount of any premium (and whether or not such premium was sufficient for the risk assumed by Surety) shall have no bearing on surety’s absolute and unconditional obligation to the City upon the principal’s default of its obligation under this bond.
In witness whereof, this instrument has been duly executed by the principal and surety above named, on ____________________, 20__.
2. A bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized, California admitted corporate sureties with a minimum A rating for the security of laborers and material men shall be substantially the form prescribed by the Subdivision Map Act.
B. Amount:
1. Performance: For faithful performance the amount of improvement security shall be based upon the total estimated cost of the improvements as determined by the City Engineer. Improvement security securing faithful performance of all work, including sufficient funds to insure construction staking and contract administration by the subdivider’s consulting engineer shall be an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of improvement. All improvement security shall be maintained in full force and effect for a period of 12 months following acceptance of all improvements by the City to assure the proper completion or maintenance of the work; provided that substitution or partial release of security may be authorized by the City Engineer if in the City Engineer’s opinion such substitution or partial release is consistent with the proper completion or maintenance of the work and protection of possible lien holder, and further provided, that the amount of the continuing security shall in no case be less than 25 percent of the amount of the original security.
2. Labor and material: For labor and material the improvement security securing payment to the contractor, their subcontractor and persons furnishing labor, materials and equipment to them for the improvement of the performance of the required act shall be an amount equal to 100 percent of the total estimated cost of the improvement, except if the security is in the form of a cash deposit, deposits or instrument of credit or security
interests, the amount shall be equal to 50 percent of the total estimated cost of the improvement. (Ord. 254 § 6.2 (N), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.160 General Conditions for Security and Insurance
A. General conditions: Bonds, deposits, instruments of credit, property liens and security interest in real property shall conform to the following conditions:
1. Liability of security: Any liability upon security given for the faithful performance of any act or agreement shall be limited to the condition prescribed by the Subdivision Map Act.
2. Additional secured costs: As a part of the obligation guaranteed by the security and in addition to the face amount of the security, there shall be included costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the City in successfully enforcing the obligation secured.
3. Release of security: Improvement security may be released in whole or in part in the manner prescribed by the Subdivision Map Act and in accordance with any such rules prescribed by the City Council.
B. Insurance: The subdivider shall, at their sole cost and expense, obtain and maintain in full force and effect comprehensive general public liability and property damage insurance in the following amounts:
Comprehensive liability: $2,000,000 per person
$5,000,000 per occurrence
Property Damage: $2,000,000
The required insurance shall be obtained from one or more insurance companies licensed to do business in the State of California and having a financial rating in Best’s Insurance Guide of at least “A”, which insure the City, City boards and commissions and members thereof and City officers, employees and agents against any liabilities arising out of the subdivider’s construction and installation of the improvements required as a condition of approval of the final map. All such insurance shall be in the form or forms approved by the City’s attorney, and shall name the City of Live Oak, the City’s boards and commissions and members thereof, and its officers, employees and agents as additional insureds under the coverage afforded. In addition such insurance shall be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other insurance available to the City and shall include a severability of interests (cross liability) clause. To evidence such coverages, a copy of the insurance policy or policies required herein shall be delivered to the City for approval as to form and sufficiency. Said policy or policies will provide that the City will receive a minimum of 30 days advance notice of any cancelation, material reduction or termination of insurance. Subdivider shall provide a disclosure of and City shall approve any deductibles with respect to such insurance. Said policy shall further provide that the City’s failure to comply with any reporting requirements will not affect coverage. The subdivider shall (and the policy of insurance shall) waive any claims or rights of subrogation against the City or any of the City’s insurers. All deductibles must be declared and approved by the City. The required insurance shall be obtained prior to execution of a subdivision improvement agreement when required under
Section 16.20.110 or prior to commencement of construction if no subdivision improvement agreement is required. (Ord. 254 § 6.2(0), 1982, Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.20.170 Recordation
When the City Council shall have approved the parcel map as set forth in this Chapter, the City Clerk shall transmit the map to the Sutter County Recorder in accordance with Section 66464 of the Subdivision Map Act.

16.24.010 Purpose of this Chapter
This Chapter provides standards for the design and improvement of all subdivisions. (Ord. 254 § 7.1, 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.020 Improvements Required
A. The subdivider shall construct or install improvements in streets, alleys, pedestrian ways, channels, easements, bike ways and other rights-of-way as are necessary for the general use of residents or business of the subdivision, whether created by parcel map or final map, and meet all local traffic and drainage needs in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
B. All improvements shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the most current version of the Improvement Standards. (Ord. 254 § 7.2, 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.030 Preparation of Improvement Plans
A. Improvement plans shall be prepared by or under the direction of a registered civil engineer and shall show full details of all improvements required to be installed by the provisions of this Title and of all other improvements proposed to be installed by the subdivider within any
street, alley, pedestrian way, channel, easement, bike way or other public area or right-of-way. Full details include all cross sections, profiles, estimated costs and specifications.
B. The form, layout, scale and other particulars of the plans and the number of copies provided shall be in accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer. (Ord. 254 § 7.3(A), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.040 Approval of Improvement Plans by the City Engineer
Improvement plans, estimated costs and specifications shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to commencement of construction or installation of any improvements within or to be within any future street, alley, pedestrian way, channel, easement, bike way, or other public area or right-of-way. (Ord. 254 § 7.3(8), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.050 Construction and Installation Standards
Improvements shall be constructed and installed to permanent line and grade in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, and the most current version of the Improvement Standards to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. (Ord. 254 § 7.3(C), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.060 Soils Report
A. Preliminary soils report: For every subdivision a preliminary soils report shall be prepared by a civil engineer registered in this state that specializes in soils engineering, and shall be based upon adequate test borings. The preliminary report shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review, unless the City Engineer advises the subdivider in writing that he is sufficiently familiar with the characteristics and quality of the soils within the proposed subdivision to dispense with this requirement. The City Engineer may require additional information or reject the report if it is found to be incomplete, inaccurate or unsatisfactory.
B. Soils report: If the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils, rocks or liquids containing deleterious chemicals, or other soil irregularities which, if uncorrected, could conceivably cause structural damage to buildings or other structures proposed to be erected within the subdivision, or cause construction materials such as concrete, steel and ductile or cast iron to corrode or deteriorate, a soils investigation of every potentially affected lot within the division of land shall be undertaken. The investigation shall be conducted by a civil engineer registered in this state who specializes in soils engineering who shall recommend the corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each structure proposed to be constructed in the area where the soils problem exists. A formal report of the investigation shall be filed with the City Engineer. Additionally, a geologist’s report may be required in such cases where, in the opinion of the City engineer, information contained in the preliminary or formal report or other materials indicates the need for such a report in terms of geological hazards of the area proposed for subdivision.
C. Issuance of building permits: If a soils report and/or a geologist’s report is required, the Chief Building Official shall not issue building permits in respect to buildings and other structures proposed to be built within the subdivision unless he determines:
1. That the corrective measures recommended therein are sufficient to obviate the possibility of structural damage; or
2. Any building permits thus issued shall be conditioned upon the incorporation of approved corrective measures in the building and the soils of the lot to which it relates.
D. Soils report information to be recorded with the map: When a soils report has been prepared, this fact shall be noted, together with the date of the report and the name of the engineer making the report, on an additional map sheet or on a separate document to be recorded simultaneously with the final or parcel map. (Ord. 254 § 7.3(D), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.070 Lot and Block Design Standards
A. Buildable lots: All subdivisions shall result in lots which are developable and capable of being built upon. No subdivision shall create lots which are impractical for improvement due to size or shape, location of watercourses, problems of sewage or driveway grades or other physical conditions.
B. Zoning Regulations: All lots within a proposed subdivision shall comply with the Live Oak Zoning Regulations.
C. Lot side lines: The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, shall be at right angles to the street on which the lot fronts or approximately radial to the center of curvature if such street is curved. When a lot fronts on a cul-de-sac the side lines of the lot shall be approximately radial to the center of curvature of the cul-de-sac.
D. Lots at boundary lines: No lot shall be divided by a City boundary line, nor any boundary between parcels registered under separate ownership. Each such boundary line shall be made a lot line.
E. Flag lots: Flag lots may be allowed by the Planning Commission for subdivisions when the shape of the lot and the length of public street frontage of the lot prior to subdividing makes conformance to these design standards impractical. Flag lots shall conform to the following requirements:
1. Accessway size: Accessways which serve not more than two residential lots or dwelling units shall have a minimum width of 20 feet with a 16 foot wide roadway surface. Accessways which serve any commercial or industrial lots or more than two residential lots or dwelling units shall have a minimum width of 32 feet with a 28 foot wide driveway surface.
2. All weather surface: All accessways shall be all-weather roadways constructed with a minimum of four inches of aggregate base and two inches of asphaltic concrete constructed to City standards or equivalent as approved by the Planning Commission.
F. Division into large lots: Whenever land is divided into lots which average one acre or more, blocks shall be designed to provide for the opening of streets at intervals sufficient to permit the subsequent subdivision of any such lot into smaller sized lots.
G. Block lengths: Blocks shall have a length of not more than 900 feet between street centerlines unless the design of the blocks adjacent to the proposed subdivision or other special conditions justifies departure from this requirement.
H. Double frontage: Lots having double frontage shall not be approved except where necessitated by unusual conditions. The width of each block shall be sufficient for an
ultimate layout of two tiers of lots unless the general layout in the vicinity, lines of ownership, type of use or topographical conditions or locations of major streets or freeways justify or make necessary a variation from this requirement.
I. Remnants: No remnants of property shall be left in a subdivision which do not conform to lot requirements or are not required for a private utility or public purpose. (Ord. 301 § 3 (part), 1986; Ord. 254 § 7.3(E), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.080 Streets and Highways
A. Design conformance: Street and highway design shall conform both in width and alignment to the Live Oak General Plan, any adopted specific plan and any adopted plan line and shall meet the requirements of the Improvement Standards or any individual standard adopted by the City Council or Planning Commission.
B. Dedication of real property for public streets: Those strips of land which comprise the proposed public streets within and contiguous with a subdivision shall be dedicated or irrevocably offered for dedication to the City for public street purposes, including any land required to provide the necessary supplemental width to an existing City street to conform to the width and alignment requirements in Section 16.24.080.A.
C. Street patterns: The street pattern in a subdivision shall generally provide for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas, neighborhoods or districts.
1. Alignment with existing streets: So far as practicable, street intersections shall be in alignment with existing adjacent streets by continuation of the centerlines thereof, or by adjustment by curves. Wherever streets are not in alignment, their centerlines shall be offset by not less than 100 feet.
2. Intersections of streets: Street centerlines shall be required to intersect one another at an angle as near to a right angle as is practicable by tangents in accordance with the Improvement Standards.
3. Access to adjoining lands: Where necessary to give access to or permit the satisfactory subdivision of adjoining land, proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary of the subdivision and the resulting dead end street may be approved without a turnaround. A temporary turnaround may be approved which may have a radius of 40 feet. In all other cases, a turnaround shall have the minimum dimensions shown below for cul-de-sacs.
4. Cul-de-sacs: Cul-de-sacs shall include a turning circle with a minimum radius of 40 feet at the face of curb and 50 feet at the property line, except that in industrial subdivisions cul-de-sacs shall have a minimum radius of 50 feet at the face of curb and 60 feet at the property line. Residential cul-de-sacs shall not exceed a length of 700 feet, measured from the center of the turning circle to the centerline of the intersecting street, unless there are physical conditions that justify a longer length. Cul-de-sacs in all other zone districts shall not exceed 400 feet unless topography or other special conditions warrant a longer cul-de-sac.
5. Long, straight streets discouraged: Excessively long, straight standard subdivision streets, which are conducive to high speed traffic, are discouraged.
D. Street Access:
1. Access on public streets: All lots created by a subdivision shall have frontage on a public street unless otherwise determined in Subsection16.24.080.D.2, below.
2. Access by private streets: If the Planning Commission determines that it is logical to develop land with lots that have access to private streets, such development may be approved. The subdivider shall submit a development plan showing the alignment, width, grade and material specifications of any proposed private street and the means of access to each lot and the water supply, sewerage and drainage of each lot served by the private streets. Private streets shall meet the current public street standards for materials specifications and standards for construction methods. The subdivider shall be required to provide a feasible method for the maintenance of such private streets and the liability for taxes thereon. Non-access strips at the end of streets or at the boundaries of subdivisions shall be dedicated to the City when required by the City.
E. Design Adjacent to Major Streets
1. Street intersections: The number of intersecting streets along a state highway or major street shall be kept to a minimum.
2. Driveways: Residential driveways should be prohibited from direct access onto a major street.
3. Waiver of access rights: When the side or rear lot lines of residential lots abut a major street the subdivider may be required to execute an instrument waiving the right of ingress to and egress from such lots across those side or rear lot lines. The subdivider may also be required to dedicate and improve a landscape strip and wall adjacent thereto.
F. Relation to Adjacent Street System
Streets within a subdivision are to relate in the following ways to the adjacent street system:
1. Preexisting streets: Alignment of streets shall conform to and provide for the continuation of the principal adjacent preexisting streets or to their proper projected location where the adjoining property has not been developed.
2. Street width: Width of streets shall conform to the requirements of the Improvement Standards.
3. Future access and street patterns: Streets shall be situated in such a way as to accommodate rational future access and street patterns. Whenever a tentative map or tentative parcel map indicates that an unfinished street, or half street, within the subdivision abuts adjacent land, and it is the intention of the City that the street eventually will be competed upon the adjacent land, the subdivider may be required to dedicate to the City in fee a one foot strip along the perimeter portion of the unfinished street or half street which abuts the adjacent land for the purpose of controlling access to the street from the adjacent land.
G. Service roads: When proposed lots front on a major street or highway the subdivider may be required to dedicate and improve a parallel service road to provide ingress and egress to and from each lot.
H. Curbs and gutters: Curbs and gutters shall be required on public streets and shall comply with the design requirements of the Improvements Standards.
I. Sidewalks: Sidewalks shall be required on public streets and shall be located within the street right-of-way. Sidewalks shall comply with the design requirements of the Improvement Standards.
J. Pedestrian ways: Other pedestrian ways outside of the street right-of-way may be required for access to schools, parks, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation facilities or other community facilities.
K. Bikeways: All subdivisions shall be designed to include rights-of-way for bicycle movement, which rights-of-way may be required to be separate from streets. The location and improvement of these rights-of way shall be designed in such a way as to maximize (1) convenience of movement throughout the subdivision, (2) access to community facilities, and (3) safety of persons using the pedestrian and bikeways. (Ord. 254 § 7.3(F), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.090 Utilities
Unless otherwise approved by the Planning Commission, utilities within a subdivision shall be subject to the following provisions:
A. Easements: All utilities shall be placed in right-of-way dedicated to the public. Whenever it is necessary for the installation, operation and maintenance of utilities and utility accessories, easements shall be provided along any front, side or rear lot line, or across lots as may be required by the City Engineer. Widths of easements for utility companies and agencies shall be determined by the company or agency.
B. Utility crossing of a state highway or railroad: When any storm drain, sanitary sewer or domestic water line crosses a state highway or railroad, a permit from the responsible agency shall first be obtained.
C. Undergrounding utilities:
1. Required undergrounding and exceptions: Electric, communication or similar or associated utility distribution facilities installed in and for the purpose of supplying service to each lot within the subdivision, and any existing overhead utility facilities located within the subdivision or on those portions of streets which abut the subdivision, shall be placed underground in accordance with the utilities rules and regulations on file with the California Public Utilities Commission. The following facilities are excepted from the provisions of this subsection:
a. Municipal facilities: Any City facilities or equipment that are excepted by the City Engineer;
b. Lighting: Poles or electroliers used exclusively for street lighting;
c. Over 34,500 volts: Poles, overhead wires and associated overhead structures used for transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of 34,550 volts;
d. Antenna installation: Antennae, associated equipment and supporting structures used by a utility for furnishing communication services;
e. Underground appurtenances: Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities such as surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets and concealed ducts; and
f. Temporary facilities: Temporary poles, temporary overhead wires and associated temporary overhead structures used or to be used during the course of construction in conjunction with a construction project.
2. Waiver of undergrounding for difficult physical conditions: The Planning Commission may waive the requirement that existing overhead utility facilities that are located within the subdivision, or on those portions of streets which abut the subdivision, be relocated to underground if it finds that topographical, soil or other physical conditions make the undergrounding as otherwise required by this subsection, unreasonable or impracticable.
3. Subdivider responsibility: The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this subsection and shall make the necessary arrangements with the utility companies involved for the installation of the facilities.
4. Grading: Public rights-of-way and easements where utilities are to be placed underground shall be graded to within six inches of the final grade prior to installation of those utilities. Grades of curbs shall be determined and staked before utilities are installed underground. (Ord. 254 § 7.4(A), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.100 Drainage
A. Existing ditches or natural channels: The subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way for storm drainage conforming substantially with the lines of any ditch or natural watercourse that traverses through or adjacent to the subdivision, or, at the option of the City Engineer, the subdivider shall provide by further dedication or sufficient easements or constructions or both, to dispose of such surface and storm water. The diversion of natural channels or existing ditches will be allowed only within the limits of the proposed improvement. All natural drainage must leave the improved area on the original horizontal and vertical alignment unless special arrangements and agreements are made with adjoining property owners. All existing natural channels or ditches shall be replaced with underground closed conduits. Open channels will only be considered for the conveyance of drainage if the peak storm water discharge is large enough to render a closed conduit infeasible due to physical constraints where slope, width and depth renders a closed conduit unable to meet horizontal and vertical alignment requirements stated herein. This open ditch exception applies only to regional storm water conveyance systems and then only upon the approval of the City Engineer. The design of such structures will be reviewed on an individual basis.
B. Stormwater drainage design: The design of storm drainage facilities, including storm drainage detention facilities, shall be in accordance with the Improvement Standards.
C. Lot grading: The ground surface of each lot shall be graded to channel storm drainage runoff from each lot into the street gutter or into an approved underground storm drainage conduit. (Ord. 383 § 4, 1992: Ord. 254 § 7.4(B), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.110 Checking Fee
At the time of acceptance of a tentative parcel map for distribution, the subdivider or its agent shall pay a map checking fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council. (Ord. 254 § 7.4(C), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.120 Sanitary Sewer
A. Sanitary sewer design: Design of sanitary sewer facilities shall be in accordance with the City’s public sewer construction ordinance and the improvement standards.
B. Connection to the existing sewer system: The City shall direct the contractor’s representative in the procedures, methods and timing of any connection to the City’s existing sewer mains, manholes and appurtenances. The contractor’s representative shall then direct his forces in accordance with the City’s instructions. (Ord. 301 § 2(D), 1986: Ord. 254 § 7.4(D), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.130 Survey Monuments
The developer shall provide for the placement of standard street survey monuments in accordance with the provisions of Chapters 16.18 and 16.20. (Ord. 301 § 2(E) 1986; Ord. 254 § 7,4(E), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011).
16.24.140 Street Trees
Trees shall be planted along all streets and public ways included within and bordering the subdivision in accordance with the Improvement Standards. Tree species shall be selected from the master tree list in the Improvement Standards. The trees shall be kept watered by the subdivider or the subsequent owners of the lots on which the trees front. (Ord. 301 § 2(F), 1986: Ord. 254 § 7.4(F), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.150 Lighting
All lighting on dedicated rights-of-way shall be installed in accordance with the Improvement Standards. (Ord. 301 § 2(G), 1986: Ord. 254 § 7.4(G), 1982, Ord. 539 §, 2011)
16.24.160 Signs and Posts
Street signs and posts shall be installed as required by the City Engineer.

This Chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Subdivision Map Act, known as the Quimby Act, for the purpose implementing the Parks and Recreation Element of the Live Oak General Plan, by providing for the acquisition of park land for neighborhood and community parks or payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, and the development of park and recreation facilities. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.020 Requirements
As a condition of approval of a final map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate land or pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the City, for park or recreational purposes according to the standards and formula contained in this Chapter. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.030 Limitations on Application of this Chapter
A. 50 lots or less: In subdivisions containing 50 lots or less, the City shall require only the payment of fees and shall not require the dedication of land. However, nothing in this Section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in a subdivision of 50 lots or less where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the City.
B. Less than 5 lots: Subdivisions of less than five lots and not intended for residential purposes shall be exempted from the requirements of this Chapter provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such tentative parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residence or residences on one or more of the lots, the fee may be required to be paid as a condition of the permit.
C. Non-residential subdivisions: The provisions of this Chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions, nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building which is more than five years old when no new residences are added. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.040 Park Acreage Standard
In accordance with the Parks and Recreation Element of the Live Oak General Plan and subsequent amendments thereto, it is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five acres of land for each 1,000 residents within the City be devoted to park and recreational facilities. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.050 Requirements for Subdivision Approval
As a condition of approval for any final map or parcel map, except as provided in Section 16.50.030, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the City, for park or recreational purposes according to the following standards:
A. Dedication of land: Where a park or recreation facility is designated in the General Plan and the park or facility is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the subdivider shall
be required to dedicate land for park and recreational facilities. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the standards set forth in this Chapter.
B. Fees in lieu of land dedication: If there is no park or recreational facility designated or required in whole or part within the proposed subdivision, and the proposed subdivision is within one mile of a proposed park or recreational facility, the subdivider shall be required to pay a cash payment in lieu of the land equal to the value of the land as determined by the provisions of this Chapter.
C. Land dedication and in-lieu fees required: In certain subdivisions a combination of land dedication and fee payment may be required in accordance with Section 16.50.100. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.060 Formula for the Dedication of Land
Where the dedication of land is a condition of a final map, the amount of such land to be dedicated per residence shall be based on the following:
Where the average number of persons per residence in the City of Live Oak is 3.43 (based on the 2000 U.S. Census; newer Census data may be used as it becomes available).
Where acres per person required is 0.005 (from Section 16.50.040).
Therefore:
3.43 X 0.005 = 0.017 acre of land dedication is required per residence.
(Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.070 Improvements Required for Land Dedication
In addition to the land dedication prescribed in Section 16.50.060 the subdivider shall provide:
A. Public improvements: Utility line extensions and street improvements including curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street paving and street lights to land which is dedicated pursuant to this Chapter; and
B. Other improvements: Other improvements which the City determines to be essential to the acceptance of the land for park or recreational purposes. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.080 Formula for Fees In Lieu of Land Dedication
A. General formula: If there is no park or recreation facility designated in the General Plan to be located in whole or part within the proposed subdivision, or the subdivision consists of 50 or fewer lots, the developer, in lieu of land, shall pay a fee equal to the value of that land plus 20 percent towards the cost of public improvements, as described in Section 16.50.070.
B. Calculation of in-lieu fees: The amount of in-lieu fees shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication, as determined by the City Council. The amount to be paid shall be a sum calculated pursuant to the following formula:
A x V = M
Where A = the amount of land required for dedication as determined in Section 16.50.060.
Where V = the fair market value (per acre) of the property to be subdivided as established by the City Council.
Where M = the number of dollars to be paid in lieu of dedication of land, to which shall be added 20 percent for the public improvements.
(Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.090 Use and Basis for In-lieu Fees
The money collected pursuant to this Chapter is to be used only for the purpose of providing park or recreational facilities to serve the subdivision from which the fees are collected. These fees shall be used to purchase land, equipment or to construct improvements to neighborhood and community parks or recreational facilities serving the subdivision. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.100 Requirement for a Combination of Land Dedication and Fees
A combination of dedication of land and payment of in-lieu fees may be required when the following exists:
A. When only a portion of the land proposed for a park or recreation site is within the subdivision or is acceptable to the City as a site for a park or recreation facility, such portion shall be dedicated for park or recreation purposes, and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall be paid for the value of any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this Chapter.
B. When a part of a park or recreation site has already been acquired by the City and only a portion of the land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated; and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land which would otherwise have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this Chapter. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.50.110 Credit for Private Facilities
Where private open space usable for park or recreational purposes is provided in a planned development, real estate development, stock cooperative and community apartment project, as defined in Sections 11003, 11003.1, 11003.2, 11003.4 and 11004, respectively of the Business and Professions Code, and condominiums, as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, partial credit, not to exceed 50 percent, shall be given against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in-lieu thereof if the Planning Commission finds that it is in the public’s interest to do so and that all of the following standards are met:
A. Consistent with the General Plan: The facilities proposed are in substantial conformance with the Parks and Recreation Element of the Live Oak General Plan and any implementing park studies; and
B. Not in required open space: Yards and other open areas required by the zoning and building regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and
C. Homeowners association: The private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by an owners association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being an incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by a 75 percent affirmative vote of the membership and approved by the City, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner on the project is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a charge for a proportionate share of the expenses for maintaining the facilities; and

C. Subsections A. and B. of this Section do not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law, including this Title, regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established.
D. Nothing contained in Subsection A. of this Section shall be deemed to prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease or finance real property or to construct improvements thereon where such sale, lease or financing, or the commencement of construction, is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final map or parcel map, as required under the Subdivision Map Act or this Title.
E. Nothing in Subsections A. to D. of this Section, inclusive, shall in any way modify or affect the provisions of Section 11018.2 of the Business and Professions Code.
F. For purposes of this Section, the limitation period for commencing an action, either civil or criminal, against the subdivider or owner of record at the time of a violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title, shall be tolled for any time period during which there is no constructive notice of the transaction constituting the violation, because the owner of record, at the time of the violation or at any time thereafter, failed to record a deed, lease or financing document with the Sutter County Recorder. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.56.020 Violations and Penalties
Each violation of the Subdivision Map Act and this Title by a person who is the subdivider or an owner of record at the time of the violation, of property involved in the violation shall be
punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding $10,000, or by both that fine and imprisonment. Every other violation of the Subdivision Map Act and this Title is a misdemeanor. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.56.030 Remedies
A. Any deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell real property which has been divided or which has resulted from a division in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his/her heirs, personal representative or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year after the date of discovery of such violation but the deed of conveyance, sale or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his or her assignee, heir or devisee.
B. Any grantee, or successor in interest thereof, of real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title may, within one year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to recover any damages suffered by reason of such division of property. The action may be brought against the person who so divided the property and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property.
C. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to Section 16.56.040 of this Chapter or identified in a recorded final map or parcel map, from and after the date of recording.
D. The provisions of this Chapter shall not limit or affect, in any way, the rights of a grantee or successor in interest under any provision of law.
E. The Subdivision Map Act does not bar any legal or equitable or summary remedy to which the City or other public agency, or any person, firm or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the City or other public agency, or such person, firm or corporation may file a suit in the superior court to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision or sale, lease or financing in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title.
F. The City shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided or which resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title, if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to the public’s health or safety. The authority to deny such a permit or such approval shall apply whether the applicant therefore was the owner of record at the time of such violation or whether the applicant therefore is either the current owner of record or a vendee thereof pursuant to a contract of sale of the real property with, or without, actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of an interest in such real property.
G. If the City issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any real property which has been divided or which resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title, the City may impose those conditions which would have
been applicable to the division of the property at the time the applicant acquired interest in such real property. If the applicant was the owner of record at the time of the initial violation, the City may impose conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.56.040, only those provisions stipulated in that certificate shall be applicable. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.56.040 Certificate of Compliance
This Section provides procedures for the processing of certificates of compliance, consistent with the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act Section 66499.35. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
A. Applicability: A certificate of compliance is a document recorded by the Sutter County Recorder, which acknowledges that the lot is considered by the City of Live Oak to be a legal lot of record. Any person owning real property, or a purchaser of the property in a contract of sale of the property, may request a certificate of compliance.
B. Application contents: A certificate of compliance application shall include the form provided by the City, the required filing fee, a chain of title, consisting of copies of all deeds beginning before the division and thereafter, unless the lots were created through a recorded subdivision map.
C. City Engineer review
1. Upon making a determination that the real property complies with the provisions of the Live Oak Municipal Code and the Map Act, the City Engineer shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the Sutter County Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division of land complies with applicable provisions of the City of Live Oak Municipal Code and the Subdivision Map Act.
2. If the City Engineer determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of the City of Live Oak Municipal Code or Subdivision Map Act, the City Engineer may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose conditions. Upon making a determination and establishing conditions, the City Engineer shall file a conditional certificate of compliance for record with the County Recorder. The certificate shall serve as a notice to the property owner who has applied for the certificate or a purchaser of the property, that the fulfillment and implementation of the conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property.
3. Compliance with the conditions shall not be required until a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property is issued.
D. Form of certificate: The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property, shall state that the division complies with the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and this Title, and shall include all information required by the Subdivision Map Act Section 66499.35.
E. Effective date of certificate of compliance: A certificate of compliance shall not become final until the document has been recorded by the Sutter County Recorder.
F. Recorded final or parcel map: A recorded final or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the lots of real property described in the final or parcel map. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)
16.56.050 Notice of Violation
Whenever the City has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the Subdivision Map Act or this Title, a notice of intention to file a notice of violation shall be mailed by certified mail to the current owner of record. The notice shall describe the property in detail, name the owners, describe the violation and state that the owner will be given the opportunity to present evidence. The notice shall also contain an explanation as to why the subject parcel is not lawful under Section 66412.6(a) of the Subdivision Map Act. The notice shall specify the date, time and place for a meeting at which the owner may present evidence to the Planning Commission why a notice of violation should not be recorded.
The meeting shall be held no sooner than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date of mailing the notice of intention to record a notice of violation. If, within 15 days of receipt of the notice, the owner fails to file with the City a written objection to recording the notice of violation, the City shall file the notice of violation for record with the Sutter County Recorder. If, after the owner has presented evidence, the Planning Commission determines that there has been no violation, the City shall mail a clearance letter to the then current owner of record. If, however, after the owner has presented evidence, the Planning Commission determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the Planning Commission shall file the notice of violation for record with the Sutter County Recorder.
The notice of violation, when recorded, shall be deemed to be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in such property. (Ord. 539 § 1, 2011)

17.01.010 Title
Title 17 of the City of Live Oak Municipal Code shall be known as the City of Live Oak Zoning Regulations.
17.01.020 Purpose
A. To implement the goals and policies of the Live Oak General Plan through the designation of compatible land uses, residential densities and intensity of uses.
B. To promote and protect the public’s health, safety, peace, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
C. To provide open space, light and air, privacy, convenience of access, aesthetic values and protection of public and private improvements.
D. To protect the social and economic stability of residential, commercial and industrial uses and activities through orderly and planned use of land.
E. To minimize the process necessary to obtain rights to develop property while fulfilling the objectives provided above.
17.01.030 Comprised of Text and Maps
There are two portions of the Zoning Regulations: the text and the official zoning map(s). The zoning map delineates the zone district for each parcel of land in the City. The text of this Title describes the permitted uses and development standards within each of those zone districts. With the exception of limited occasions, all use of land and improvements to the land within each zone district must conform to the provisions of that zone district, as described in this Title.
17.01.040 Establishment of Zone Districts
The City is hereby divided into the following zone districts:
Residential Zone Districts:
Low Density Residential (R-1) Zone District
Small Lot Residential (R-2) Zone District
Medium Density Residential (R-3) Zone District
Multiple Family Residential (R-4) Zone District
Commercial Zone Districts:
General Commercial (C-G) Zone District
Commercial-Mixed Use (C-MU) Zone District
Employment Zone Districts:
Employment (E) Zone District
Industrial (M) Zone District
Miscellaneous Zone Districts:
Civic (C) Zone District
Urban Reserve (UR) Zone District

Combining Zone Districts:
Special Design (SD) Combining Zone District
Specific Plan (SP) Combining Zone District
Downtown (D) Combining Zone District
Neighborhood Center (NC) Combining Zone District
Civic Center (CC) Combining Zone District
17.01.050 Minimum Requirements
The Zoning Regulations shall be deemed the minimum requirements to promote and preserve the public’s health, safety, and general welfare, unless otherwise noted.
17.01.060 Uncertainty of Uses
The list of uses within each zone district is representative of the expected uses that may occur within that zone district. The list is not intended to be a complete representation of every possible use. Where a proposed use is not specifically listed by a zone district as a permitted use or permitted with an approved zoning clearance or use permit, the Community Development
Director may determine the use is a permitted use, or the use is permitted if a zoning clearance or use permit is first secured, provided the following findings can be made:
A. The proposed use is similar in character and impact to a listed use; and
B. The proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use, including requiring the same permits and application of the same development standards.
17.01.070 Uncertainty of Boundaries
When an uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zone district is shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
A. Where a zone district boundary is indicated as approximately following a highway, street, or alley, the centerlines of such roadway shall be construed as the boundary.
B. Where a zone district boundary is indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed as the zone district boundary.
C. In the case of a zone district boundary dividing a lot, the location of such boundary, unless indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale of the zoning map.
D. Where a public street or alley or parcel of land is officially vacated, the zone district regulations of abutting properties shall apply to such vacated street, or alley.
E. In case of further uncertainty, the Planning Commission shall determine the location of the zone district boundary.
17.01.080 Application of Pre-annexation Zoning
The City may apply pre-annexation zoning to unincorporated property located within the area defined by the General Plan. The pre-annexation zoning process shall comply with the provisions of Chap. 17.36. Territory annexed into the City shall automatically be added to the zoning map and shall be classified the same as the pre-annexation zoning, effective on the date of the annexation into the City.
17.01.090 Fees
The City Council may establish by resolution, and may amend or revise from time to time, fees for processing the various applications authorized or required by this Title. All fees shall be paid at the time the application is filed and no processing shall commence until such fee is paid in full.
17.01.100 Conflicts with Other Laws and Agreements
When conflicts occur between regulations of this Title and any other codes, ordinances or regulations, the more restrictive provision shall apply, unless otherwise provided.
It is not intended by the provisions of this Title to interfere with or annul any easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties; provided, however, when the provisions of this
Title impose a greater restriction upon use of buildings, premises, or spaces than are imposed or required by such easements, covenants, or agreements, the provisions of this Title shall apply.

17.02.010 Purpose of the Residential Zone Districts
The purposes of the residential zone districts are as follows:
Low Density Residential (R-1) Zone District: Applied to traditional suburban neighborhoods, primarily consisting of detached single family residences and uses compatible with single family uses. This zone district can be applied throughout the City were low density residential uses are deemed appropriate. The R-1 Zone District is consistent with the Low Density Residential General Plan designation.
Small Lot Residential (R-2) Zone District: Provides areas similar to the R-1 Zone District but also allows for smaller single family lots and duplexes. It also allows uses compatible with these residential uses. This zone district is primarily utilized around and within areas designated by the General Plan as a Neighborhood Center or Civic Centers. The R-2 Zone District is also consistent with the Small Lot Residential General Plan designation.
Medium Density Residential (R-3) Zone District: Allows higher density single family residential development, duplexes, attached townhouses and garden apartments. This zone district is primarily located within areas designated by the General Plan as a Neighborhood Center or Civic Center. The R-3 Zone District is also consistent with the Medium Density Residential General Plan designation.
Multiple Family Residential (R-4) Zone District: Provides for the highest density residential uses with a level of standards conducive to providing a suitable living environment to those living in multiple family residences, as well as uses compatible with multiple family neighborhoods. This zone district is primarily located within areas designated by the General Plan as a Neighborhood Center or Civic Center. The R-4 Zone District is also consistent with the High Density Residential General Plan designation.
17.02.020 Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements
Table 17.02.020 identifies the uses of land allowed by each of the residential zone districts. The last column of the table identifies a section of this Title that references additional land use regulations or development standards that are applicable to that use. The applicable permit requirements for each use are established by the letter designations as follows:
“P” Designates a permitted use. New development requires a development plan review which is a ministerial staff review process that ensures compliance with all City development standards, pursuant to Sec. 17.35.010.
“ZC” Designates that a zoning clearance is needed, which is a ministerial staff review, pursuant to Sec. 17.35.020.
“U” Designates that a use permit is required, pursuant to Sec. 17.35.030.
Blank Not an allowable use in that zone district.

17.07.010 Purpose of the Planned Development Zone District
The PD Zone District is intended to provide for flexibility in site planning and design for residential, commercial, industrial and mixed use projects that encourage and facilitate creative design and use of land in the City which may otherwise be stifled by the standardized zone districts. The resulting projects should be of equal or greater quality than would result from utilizing a standard zone district. The PD Zone District is consistent with all General Plan designations provided that, upon adoption of this zone district, a finding is made that the permitted use or combination of uses and their permitted density and intensity of development are within the range anticipated by the appropriate General Plan designation(s).
17.07.020 Allowed Uses
Any use or combination of uses which are arranged and designed in such a manner as to result in a development which is internally compatible, compatible with neighboring uses and consistent with the General Plan. The density and intensity of the uses shall be limited to that allowed by the General Plan.
17.07.030 Development Standards
Development standards shall be determined for each PD Zone District based on the merits of the project, provided that the resulting project is equal to or exceeds the quality that would result from utilizing standard zone districts.

17.07.050 Applications
Applications for a PD Zone District shall contain a full description of all types of uses, the proposed development standards and a site plan for the project. The description, standards and all plans shall include detailed information needed to evaluate the project, including building elevations and site design standards for roads, parking landscaping, signage, etc., phasing plans, if any, and any other information deemed necessary by the Community Development Director.
17.07.060 Findings
Approval of a PD Zone District can be made only upon making all of the following findings:
A. The project is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.
B. All of the development standards applied to the PD Zone District will result in a project that meets or exceeds the quality expected of a project allowed by a standard zone district(s).
C. There are adequate public services, facilities and utilities available to properly serve the project.
D. All impacted streets will be within acceptable levels of service.
E. The proposed uses, location, size, design features and operational characteristics will be compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
F. The establishment, operation and maintenance of the use(s) and facilities will not be detrimental to the public’s health, safety and general welfare.
17.07.070 Detailed Plans Required
Prior to issuance of any building permits, detailed development plans shall be submitted to the Community Development Director for review and approval for substantial compliance with the approved planned development.
17.07.080 Ongoing Review
If construction has not commenced within two years of the effective date of the PD Zone District and every two years thereafter, until the project is completed, the Planning Commission shall review the project to determine if a zone change to amend the PD or otherwise change the zoning to a more appropriate zone district may be warranted. If it is determined that a revision should be considered, the Planning Commission shall authorize a rezoning process to proceed, as provided in Chap. 17.36.

A. Purpose: It is the policy of the City of Live Oak, pursuant to the federal Fair Housing Act (hereafter “fair housing laws”) to provide individuals with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures to ensure equal access to housing and facilitate the development of housing for individuals with disabilities. This ordinance establishes a procedure for making requests for reasonable accommodation in the Zoning Regulations to comply with the intent and purpose of fair housing laws.
B. Findings: The City Council finds: The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodation in their zoning regulations and practices when such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to housing;
1. The Housing Element of the Live Oak General Plan must identify and develop a plan for removing governmental constraints to housing for individuals with disabilities including zoning constraints or providing reasonable accommodation;
2. The Attorney General of the State of California has recommended that cities and counties implement fair housing reasonable accommodation procedures for making zoning determinations concerning individuals with disabilities to further the development of housing for individuals with disabilities;
3. A fair housing reasonable accommodation procedure for individuals with disabilities and developers of housing for individuals with disabilities to seek relief in the application of zoning regulations and procedures will further the City’s compliance with federal and state housing laws and provide greater opportunities for the development of critically needed housing for individuals with disabilities.
C. Applicability: Reasonable accommodation in zoning context means providing individuals with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application of zoning regulations and procedures, or even waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
An individual with a disability is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment, or anyone with a record of such impairment.
A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when application for a zoning regulation or procedure acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities.
D. Notice to the Public of Availability of accommodation Process: Notice of the availability of reasonable accommodation shall be prominently displayed at public information counters in the Planning and Building Departments, advising the public of the availability of the procedure for eligible individuals. Forms for requesting reasonable accommodation shall be available to the public in the Planning and Building Departments.
E. Requesting reasonable accommodation:
1. In order to make housing available to an individual with a disability, any eligible person as defined in Subsection C. may request a reasonable accommodation in the Zoning Regulations or procedures.
2. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be made in writing and provide the following information:
a. Name and address of the individual(s) requesting reasonable accommodation;
b. Name and address of the property owner(s);
c. Address of the property for which accommodation is requested;
d. Description of the regulation(s) or procedure for which accommodation is sought; and
e. Reason that the requested accommodation may be necessary for the individual(s) with the disability to use and enjoy the dwelling.
3. A request for reasonable accommodation in regulation or procedures may be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. A reasonable accommodation does not affect an individual’s obligations to comply with other applicable regulations not at issue in the requested accommodation.
4. If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, the City shall provide assistance to ensure that the process is accessible.
F. Reviewing authority:
1. Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director using the criteria set forth in Subsection G.
2. The Community Development Director shall issue a written decision on a request for reasonable accommodation within 30 days of the date of the application and may either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation in accordance with the required findings set forth in Subsection G.
3. If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the Community Development Director may request further information from the applicant consistent with fair housing laws, specifying in detail the information that is required. In the event that a request for additional information is made, the 30 day period to issue a decision is stayed until the applicant responds to the request.
G. Required findings: The written decision to grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with fair housing laws and based on the following factors:
1. Whether the housing, which is subject to the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual with disabilities protected under fair housing laws;
2. Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the fair housing laws;
3. Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the jurisdiction; and
4. Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the jurisdiction’s zoning regulations.
H. Written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation:
1. The written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation shall explain in detail the basis of the decision, including the Community Development Director’s findings on the criteria set forth in this chapter. All written decisions shall give notice
of the applicant’s right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process set below. The notice of decision shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail.
2. The written decision of the reviewing authority shall be final unless it is appealed to the Planning Commission.
3. If the Community Development Director fails to render a written decision on the request for reasonable accommodation within 30 days, the request for reasonable accommodation shall be deemed granted.
4. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulation otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect.
I. Appeals
1. Within 10 days of the date of the Community Development Director’s written decision, any party may appeal the decision to the Planning Commission. Appeals from the adverse decision shall be made in writing.
2. If the appellant needs assistance in filing an appeal, the City shall provide assistance to ensure the appeal process is accessible.
3. All appeals shall contain a statement of the grounds for the appeal.
4. Nothing in this procedure shall preclude an aggrieved individual form seeking any other state or federal remedy available. (Ord. 544 §1, 2013)

17.17.010 Findings and Purpose
A. The City Council hereby finds that the cultivation of medical marijuana significantly impacts, or has the potential to significantly impact, the City’s jurisdiction. These impacts include damage to buildings in which cultivation occurs, including improper and dangerous electrical alterations and use, inadequate ventilation, increased occurrences of home-invasion robberies and similar crimes and nuisance impacts to neighboring properties from the strong and potentially noxious odors from the plants and increased crime.
B. It is acknowledged that the voters of the State of California have provided a criminal defense to the cultivation, possession and use of marijuana for medical purposes through the adoption of the Compassionate Use Act in 1996 pursuant to Proposition 215 and codified as Health and safety Code section 11362.5. The Compassionate Use Act (CUA)
does not address the land use or other impacts that are caused by the cultivation of medical marijuana.
C. The purpose of this Section is to adopt rules consistent with the CUA and the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA) commencing with Health and Safety Code section 11362.7 to regulate medical marijuana in a manner that protects the public health, safety and welfare of the community and prevents adverse impacts which such activities may have on nearby properties and residents, without interfering with the rights of qualified patients and their primary caregivers to possess or cultivate medical marijuana pursuant to state law.
D. The CUA is limited in scope, in that it only provides a defense from criminal prosecution for possession and cultivation of marijuana to qualified patients and their primary caregivers. The scope of the MMPA is also limited in that it establishes a statewide identification program and affords qualified patients, persons with identification cards and their primary caregivers, an affirmative defense to certain enumerated criminal sanctions that would otherwise apply to transporting, processing, administering or distributing marijuana.
E. The CUA and MMPA do not appear to have facilitated the stated goals of providing access to marijuana for patients in medical need of marijuana, but instead the predominant use of marijuana has been for recreational and not medicinal purposes. As the report issued by the California Chiefs Association on September 2009, entitled “California Chiefs Association Position Paper on Decriminalizing Marijuana” states, “[i]t has become clear, despite the claims of use by critically ill people that only about 2% of those using crude marijuana for medicine are critically ill. The vast majority of those using crude marijuana as medicine are young and are using the substance to be under the influence of THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] and have no critical medical condition.” (California Chiefs Association’s Position Paper on Decriminalizing Marijuana, available at the Planning Department.)
F. Facilities purportedly dispensing marijuana for medicinal purposes are commonly referred to as medical marijuana dispensaries, medical marijuana cooperatives or medical marijuana collectives; however, these terms are not defined anywhere in the CUA or MMPA. Significantly, nothing in the CUA of MMPA specifically authorizes the operation and the establishment of medical marijuana dispensing facilities.
G. Further, neither the CUA nor MMPA require or impose an affirmative duty or mandate upon local governments, such as the City of Live Oak, to allow, authorize or sanction the establishment and the operation and establishment of facilities dispensing medical marijuana within its jurisdiction. Moreover, the CUA did not create a constitutional right to obtain medical marijuana.
H. It is critical to note that neither Act abrogates the City’s powers to regulate for public health, safety and welfare. Health and Safety Code 11362.5(b)(2) provides that the Act does not supersede any legislation intended to prohibit conduct that endangers others. In
addition, Health and Safety Code 11352.83 authorizes cities and counties to adopt and enforce rules and regulations consistent with the MMPA.
I. On August 25, 2008, Edmond G. Brown, the California Attorney General, issued “Guidelines for the Security and Non-Diversion of Marijuana Grown for Medical Use” (“the Attorney General Guidelines”), which sets regulations intended to ensure the security and non-diversion of marijuana grown for medical use by qualified patients. Health and Safety Code 11362.81(d) authorizes the Attorney General to “develop and adopt appropriate guidelines to ensure the security and non-diversion of marijuana grown for medical use by patients qualified under” the CUA. Nothing in the Guidelines imposes an affirmative mandate or duty upon local governments, such as the City of Live Oak, to allow, sanction or permit the establishment or the operation of facilities dispensing medical marijuana within their jurisdictional limits.
J. Marijuana remains an illegal substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 801, et seq. and is classified as a “Schedule I Drug” which is defined as a drug or other substance that has a high potential for abuse, that is no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and that has not been accepted as safe for its use under medical supervision. Furthermore, the Federal Controlled Substances Act makes it unlawful for any person to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense marijuana. The Controlled Substances Act contains no statutory exemption for the possession of marijuana for medical purposes. The City does not wish to be in violation of federal law.
K. Pursuant to the City of Live Oak’s police powers authorized in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution, as well as under the City of Live Oak Municipal Code, the City has the power to regulate permissible land uses throughout the City and to enact regulations for the preservation of public health, safety and welfare of its residents and community. And, pursuant to Government Code 38771 the City also has the power through the City Council to declare actions and activities that constitute a public nuisance.
L. The City Council finds that neither the CUA nor the MMPA preempts the City’s exercise of its traditional police powers in enacting land use and zoning regulations, as well as legislation for preservation of public health, safety and welfare, such as this zoning ordinance prohibiting the establishment and operation of medical marijuana cooperatives and collectives within the City.
M. The City Council finds that the public health, safety and general welfare of the City and its residents necessitates and requires the adoption of this zoning ordinance, prohibiting the establishment and operation of medical marijuana cooperatives and collectives, in order to: (a) protect and safeguard against the detrimental secondary negative effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing medical marijuana; (b) preserve and safeguard the minors, children and students in the community from the deleterious impacts of medical marijuana facilities; and (c) preserve the City’s law enforcement services, in that monitoring and addressing the negative secondary effects and adverse impacts will likely
burden the City’s law enforcement resources. The City Council further finds that due to negative secondary effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing medical marijuana, the establishment and operation of these facilities will negatively impact the City.
N. The Zoning Regulations are consistent with the Live Oak 2030 General Plan in that the General Plan, its goals, objectives and policies do not permit or contemplate the establishment or operation of medical marijuana cooperatives, collectives or similar facilities that engage in dispensing of marijuana for medicinal purposes. (Ord. 538, § 3, 2011)

A. Purpose: The development plan review is utilized for projects that are considered to be “permitted uses” and is an administrative process conducted by the Community Development Director. It is intended to ensure that the proposed project is in conformance with all City development and design standards. For larger development projects an extra level of review is added to ensure compliance with the General Plan Circulation Element.
B. Process: Projects subject to a development plan review shall be reviewed and decided upon by the Community Development Director within 30 days of receipt of all requested information or, in the case of projects described below in Subsec. 17.35.010. C. in which a traffic study is required, the review by the Director shall be completed with 30 days of completion and acceptance by the City of the traffic study.
C. Review of larger projects for traffic impacts: For projects that meet or exceed the size provided below in Table 17.35.010 the City shall conduct a traffic study for the proposed project. If the resulting study concludes that the project will increase traffic levels that exceed General Plan level of service standards, either on a project specific level or a 20 year cumulative level or both, street improvements shall be incorporated into the project that reduces the traffic levels of service to be within the standards provided in the General Plan at both the project specific level and 20 year cumulative level, as determined by the Community Development Director. In lieu of providing the street improvements, a fee may be paid to the City by the applicant in an amount that mitigates the project’s fair share of traffic impacts, as determined by the City (Ord. 540 § 10, 2011).

17.38 Nonconforming Structures and Uses
Section
17.38.010 Purpose
17.38.020 Nonconforming Structures
17.38.030 Nonconforming Uses
17.38.040 Nonconforming Lots
17.38.050 Nonconforming Signs
17.38.060 Nonconforming Residential Structures in Commercial and Employment Zone Districts
17.38.070 Reestablishment of Abandoned or Destroyed Commercial or Employment Nonconforming Structures and Uses
17.38.080 Unlawful Structures and Uses
17.38.010 Purpose
This Chapter establishes uniform provisions for the regulation of nonconforming uses, structures and lots. Within zone districts established by this Title, there exist structures, land uses, and lots that were lawful prior to the adoption of this Title, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the use regulations and development standards of this Title or future amendments. It is the intent of this Chapter to discourage the long term continuance of these nonconformities, providing for their eventual elimination, but to permit them to exist under limited conditions described in this Chapter. This Chapter also recognizes that the investments made in developed property can be substantial and that provisions for continuation of certain nonconforming structures or uses may be desirable, particularly if it can be assured that the structure or use does not negatively impact adjacent properties. Further, this Chapter provides for the improvement of nonconforming structures and properties to reduce the blighting influence that can occur if abandoned structures cannot be reused for their originally designed purposes. (Ord 543, §2, 2013)
17.38.020 Nonconforming Structures
681
Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures may be continued and be maintained, subject to the following limitations:
A. Maintenance, repairs, and rehabilitation: Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be made to any nonconforming structure. Structural repairs, such as bearing walls, columns, beams or girders, may be modified only when the Building Official determines that such modification or repair is immediately necessary to protect the health and safety of the public, occupants of the nonconforming structure or adjacent property, and the cost does not exceed one-half of the replacement cost of the nonconforming structure, except as provided in Sec. 17.38.060, Nonconforming Residential Structures in Commercial and Employment Zones and Sec. 17.38.070, Reestablishment of Abandoned or Destroyed Commercial or Employment Nonconforming Structures and Uses and Sec. 17.38.080, Expansion of Nonconforming Structures.
B. Severely damaged or destroyed structures: If a nonconforming structure is damaged to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement value, as determined by the Building Official, or is destroyed, the restoration of such structure shall be in full compliance with the requirements of this Title, except as provided in Sec. 17.38.060, Nonconforming Residential Structures in Commercial and Employment Zones and Sec. 17.38.070, Reestablishment of Abandoned or Destroyed Commercial or Employment Nonconforming Structures and Uses and Sec. 17.38.080, Expansion of Nonconforming Structures.
C. Abandonment: If a nonconforming structure remains vacant for a continuous period of 12 months or more, it shall be considered abandoned and shall thereafter be removed or converted to a conforming structure, except as provided in Sec.s 17.38.060 and 17.38.070. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon showing, to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director, that during such period, the owner of the structure (1) has been maintaining it and did not intend to discontinue the use and (2) has been actively marketing the structure for use or sale or (3) has been engaged in other activities evidencing an intent not to abandon the use. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.030 Nonconforming Uses
A. Continuation: Nonconforming uses, including uses lacking permits or other entitlements, may be continued provided that such use shall not be enlarged to occupy a greater area than that occupied by the same use at the time it became nonconforming, except that a nonconforming use may be expanded if a use permit is approved, as provided in Sec. 17.38.080. Uses that are nonconforming due to lack of permits or other entitlements may be enlarged upon by first securing the required permit or other entitlement.
B. Change to the same or less intensive use: Nonconforming uses may be permitted to be changed to a different nonconforming use provided that the new use is of the
682
same or less intensive nature, as determined by the Community Development Director.
C. Change to a more intensive use or to a more intensive use: A nonconforming use may change to a more intensive use if a use permit is first approved, as provided in Sec, 17.38.080.
Exception: No nonconforming use that involves the storage, use, or generation of hazardous materials, products, or wastes or other activity that may be detrimental to the public’s health or safety because of the potential to generate dust, glare, heat, noise, noxious gases, odor, smoke, vibration or other conditions that would be incompatible with surrounding uses may be substituted for an existing nonconforming use even if the use is of the same or less intensive nature.
D. Abandonment: If a nonconforming use ceases for a continuous period of 12 months, it shall be considered abandoned and shall not be reestablished, except as provided in Sec.s 17.38.060 and 17.38.070. The presumption of abandonment may be rebutted upon showing, to the satisfaction of the Community Development Director, that during such period, the owner of the structure (1) has been maintaining it and did not intend to discontinue the use and (2) has been actively marketing the structure for use or sale or (3) has been engaged in other activities evidencing an intent not to abandon the use. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.040 Nonconforming Lots
Any lawfully created lot which fails to meet the standards for area or dimensions of the zone district in which it is located shall be considered buildable for purposes of this Chapter, provided that all site development standards for the improvements are met or a variance (Sec. 17.35.040) from any site improvement standards is approved. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.050 Nonconforming Signs
A nonconforming sign may be continued subject to the limitations pursuant to Sec. 17.38.020. Once a nonconforming sign is determined by the Community Development Director to have lost its nonconforming status, it shall be removed from the property or otherwise converted to a conforming use within 90 days of the determination. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.060 Nonconforming Residential Structures in Commercial and Employment Zone Districts
A. Reestablishment: A nonconforming residential use in a commercial or employment zone district that is involuntarily lost by damage or destruction may be re-established provided that a building permit for reconstruction is issued within 24 months of the damage or destruction.
683
B. Expansion of a nonconforming residence: A nonconforming residence may be expanded by up to 50 percent of its original floor area, provided that the expanded area meets all yard and building height standards.
C. Remodel: A nonconforming residence may be remodeled.
D. Use Permit: If the period since damage or destruction exceeds 24 months, a use permit approved by the Planning Commission is required prior to issuance of a building permit for reconstruction. If an existing nonconforming residence is proposed to be expanded beyond 50 percent of the original floor area, as provided in Subsection. B. above, or the remodel will exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost, as provided in Subsection. C. above, an approved use permit must first be secured. (Ord. 540 § 11, 2011, Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.070 Reestablishment of Abandoned or Destroyed Commercial or Employment Nonconforming Structures and Uses
A. Reestablishment: A commercial or employment structure or use which has lost its nonconforming status or is otherwise lost due to damage or destruction may be reestablished upon issuance of a use permit by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may approve the use permit if all of the following findings can be made:
1. Legally established structure or use: The structure or use was legally established but was made nonconforming by a rezoning action by the City Council.
2. No violations: No compliance actions are pending on the lot for violations of building or fire codes or other Municipal Code sections or, if there are any existing violations, this action will cause them to be corrected.
3. No adverse impacts: Re-establishment of a nonconforming use will not detrimentally impact adjacent properties.
B. Use permit conditions: The use permit may be approved subject to conditions related to improving the property to conform to current standards, provided they can reasonably be applied to the property. This could include, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Parking provisions, as provided in Chap. 17.25.
2. Installation of landscaping, as provided in Chap. 17.27.
3. Property maintenance, such as painting and general cleanup.
4. Installation of fencing.
5. Conformance with sign standards, as provided in Chap. 17.28.
6. Façade or other exterior improvements.
7. Compliance with building and fire codes.
8. Installation of public improvements such as curb, gutter, and sidewalk, undergrounding utilities, etc.
684
9. Establishment of a date certain for termination of the use. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
17.38.080 Expanding a Nonconforming Use or Changing to a More Intensive Use
A. Expanding a nonconforming use or structure: A nonconforming use or structure may be expanded upon issuance of a use permit by the Planning Commission if the following findings can be made:
1. Legally established use: The use was a legally established use that was made nonconforming by a rezoning action by the City.
2. No violations: No compliance actions are pending on the lot for violations of building or fire codes or other Municipal Code sections or, if there are existing violations, this action will cause them to be corrected.
3. No significant adverse impacts: The proposed expansion of the use or structure or the intensification of the use will not cause any significant adverse impacts on neighboring properties.
B. Use permit conditions: The use permit may be approved subject to conditions related to improving the property to conform to current standards, provided they can reasonably be applied to the property. This could include, but is not limited to, the following:
1. Parking provisions, as provided in Chap. 17.25.
2. Installation of landscaping, as provided in Chap. 17.27.
3. Conformance with sign standards, as provided in Chap. 17.28

17.38.090 Unlawful Structures and Uses
Any structure or use that did not comply with the applicable provisions of this Title or other regulations in effect when the structures or uses were established are violations of this code and are subject to appropriate action, pursuant to Title 14 (Code Enforcement). No right to continue occupancy of a property containing an illegal structure or use is granted by this Chapter. The activity shall not be allowed to continue unless or until all of the provisions of the Live Oak Municipal Code are met. (Ord. 543 § 2, 2013)
