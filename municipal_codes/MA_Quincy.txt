the creation or discovery of those resources at all levels of the public and private
sector to meet those needs.

and evening programs that will provide wholesome and meaningful
educational and recreational opportunities for youth.
G. To work closely with all service provider departments of the City to create new and
innovative ways in which families can be assisted by those dynamic and growing
institutions.

of isolation that many parents and children feel as a result of the changing family
structure.

Community-Oriented Policing and Problem-Solving Commission
[Adopted by Order No. 97-071 (Ch. 2.138 of the 1993 Code)]
§ 12-44. Findings.
§ 12-45. Establishment; membership; compensation; officers.
There shall be a Community-Oriented Policing and Problem-Solving Commission
(hereinafter referred to as the "Commission") consisting of 20 members appointed by the
Mayor of the City of Quincy unless otherwise noted.
A. Over the years, maintaining public order has shifted from being primarily the
responsibility of families, communities and individuals, assisted by police officers,
to being primarily the responsibility of the police alone. In the process, enforcing
laws and exacting penalties have become the principal if not the sole response to
public order and safety issues.
B. Community policing reverses that trend by recognizing that the community at large
is responsible for the conditions that generate crime. Deterrence, law enforcement
and incarceration by themselves cannot resolve the underlying conditions that cause
crime and social disorder. In fact, specific responsible people within the community
have as much to do with the overall policing of the community and the regulation
of conduct as uniformed police officers.
C. To cultivate this transition, an educational process and heightening of awareness
must take place. The community must accept and share responsibility with the
police for social order and both must work cooperatively in order to identify
problems and develop proactive community-wide solutions. The police must
acknowledge that they cannot do the job alone, recognize that they have valuable
resources available to them within the community and understand that the
community must be involved in the problem-solving process. In turn, government
and community leaders must recognize and accept responsibility for keeping their
neighborhoods safe. Communities must take a unified stand against crime, violence
and disregard for the law. The Police Department must help build stronger, more
self-sufficient communities, communities in which crime and disorder will not
thrive.
D. Community policing is democracy in action. All who share a concern for the
welfare of the neighborhood should bear responsibility for safeguarding that
welfare.
A. Commission members shall include permanent members and private members.
(1) The following permanent members shall serve on the Commission until their
successor is appointed: Police and Fire Chiefs, Commissioner of Natural
Resources, Director of Recreation, Superintendent of Schools, City of Quincy
Captain Community Policing, City of Quincy President Police Patrolmen's
Union, President of the Superior Officers' Association, and a community
police officer appointed by the City of Quincy Chief of Police.
§ 12-44 BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES § 12-45
12:29
§ 12-46. Rules and regulations; meetings.
A majority of the Commission shall constitute a quorum, and the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the members of the Commission shall be necessary in order to adopt any
motion or resolution. The Commission shall, from time to time, establish rules for its
proceedings. Regular and special meetings of the Commission shall be held at a time and
place fixed by the Commission. The sessions of the Commission shall be open to the
public, and every matter coming before the Commission for action shall be put to a vote,
the result of which shall be duly recorded. A full and accurate journal of the proceedings
of the Commission shall be kept and shall be open. All existing collective bargaining
agreements by the City of Quincy and all employees of the Quincy Police Department
are recognized and shall be binding upon all actions of the Commission.
§ 12-47. Functions and purpose.
The Commission is established to create a Quincy organization which will assist
Quincy's communities in building partnerships with the Quincy Police Department and
in assisting the Quincy Police Department in its mission to serve and to protect and
to enhance and expand community policing and problem-solving efforts. The work,
(2) The following members shall be asked to serve on the Commission until their
successor is appointed: the Executive Director of the Quincy Housing
Authority, an individual from the Probation Department of the Quincy District
Court appointed by the presiding justice of the Quincy District Court, an
individual from the Norfolk County Sheriff's Department appointed by the
Norfolk County Sheriff, a representative from the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and an individual from
the Norfolk County District Attorney's office appointed by the Norfolk County
District Attorney. [Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
(3) In addition, the Mayor shall make every effort to appoint three private
members from the following: court system, social service agencies and clergy.
(4) In addition, there shall be three neighborhood representatives from a
community policing area appointed by the Mayor upon the recommendation
of the community police officer.
(5) The following shall be resources to the Board: Commissioner of Public Works,
Director of Planning and Community Development, Health Commissioner,
Director of Inspectional Services and business leaders.
B. All members of the Commission shall serve without compensation.
C. A vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the term. Upon the expiration of the
term of office of a member, his/her successor shall be appointed in the same manner
aforesaid.
D. The Chairperson of the Commission shall be the Police Chief of the City of Quincy.
E. There shall be an Executive Director of the Commission who shall be a resident of
the City of Quincy. The compensation of the Executive Director shall be established
by the Mayor.
§ 12-45 QUINCY CODE § 12-47
12:30
function and purpose of the Commission shall be limited to the following:
A. Prepare a strategic plan and mission statement based on needs and objectives of the

A potential public health hazard exists from exposure to improperly disposed infectious
waste. Stringent federal and state regulations require that specified methods of infectious
waste storage, packaging and disposal be practiced by both the generator and the
disposal contractor. At the same time, this geographical area is experiencing diminished
landfill capacity, thus promoting incineration as the preferred disposal method. Although
incineration is most commonly used by hospitals, the largest quantity generators of
infectious waste, problems of incinerator acceptability by the public greatly restrict
this disposal method. As a result, disposal costs continue to escalate, particularly for
the small quantity generator of infectious waste. All of these factors contribute to the
increased potential for the improper disposal of infectious waste.
§ 175-11. Authority; purpose; applicability.
Pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31, the City adopts the ordinance codified in this article,
which is designed to impose strict penalties upon persons and/or entities responsible for
any infectious waste which is improperly disposed of within the boundaries of the City.
This article shall apply to all generators and all disposal contractors affiliated with the
disposal of any type of infectious waste.
§ 175-12. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
IMPROPER DISPOSAL OF INFECTIOUS WASTE  Any action or lack of action
which causes infectious waste to be disposed of in a manner contrary to the requirements
for proper disposal as specified in § 175-14.
INFECTIOUS WASTE  Waste which because of its infectious characteristics may
cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious
irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness, and which may pose a substantial present
or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored,
transported, disposed of or otherwise managed. "Infectious waste" includes isolation
wastes, cultures and stocks of etiologic (disease-causing) agents, blood and blood
products, pathological wastes, contaminated laboratory wastes, sharps (syringed needles,
scalpels, etc.), dialysis unit waste, animal and body parts, biologicals and contaminated
food and patient-care wastes.
INFECTIOUS WASTE DISPOSAL CONTRACTOR  Any person or company
responsible for the proper and legal disposal of solid waste, including but not limited
to hazardous infectious waste. Cleaning contractors responsible for the cleaning and
removal of waste from the property of an infectious waste generator shall be considered
a disposal contractor for the purposes of this article.
INFECTIOUS WASTE GENERATOR  Any person or entity which produces
infectious waste. Generators may include hospitals, doctors' offices, home health care
facilities, health maintenance organizations, teaching facilities (i.e., biology laboratories,
§ 175-10 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 175-12
175:7
etc.), research and development laboratories, clinics (all types, i.e., chiropractor,
acupuncture, sports medicine, etc.), veterinary facilities, nursing homes, funeral homes,
dental clinics and offices, and a single or group of individuals.
RESPONSIBLE PARTY  Any person or entity which by definition is a generator
of infectious waste and/or which, by contract, agreement or otherwise, directly or
indirectly, arranged for or participated in the improper packaging, improper transport or
improper disposal of infectious waste.
§ 175-13. Compliance with state and federal regulations. [Amended 6-1-2020 by
Order No. 2020-012]
The generator and/or disposal contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all
infectious waste is packaged and disposed of in the manner specified in the regulations
of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP). Persons or entities responsible for the transport
of infectious waste shall adhere to the appropriate United States Department of
Transportation and Massachusetts Department of Transportation regulations regarding
transportation of infectious waste on state and interstate highways.
§ 175-14. Proper disposal of infectious waste. [Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No.
2020-012]
§ 175-15. Information provided to Health Department.
All generators of infectious waste, as defined in this article, must submit in writing to
the Quincy Health Department, by March 1 of each calendar year or upon any change of
existing status or contract, the following information:
A. All infectious waste designated for off-site disposal, excluding sharp wastes, shall
be placed in nonpermeable three mil polyethylene (or equivalent) bags which are to
be securely sealed and placed into a second bag of similar construction which shall
also be securely sealed. This sealed double bag shall be placed into a rigid or semirigid
container and sealed. The container must be labeled according to Department
of Transportation regulations. Incineration of any infectious waste so contained in
a Type 4 DEP-approved incinerator, or the landfilling of treated (sterilized)
infectious waste similarly contained, and as per DEP (or out-of-state equivalent)
regulations, shall constitute proper disposal.
B. Sharp wastes, which can include hypodermic needles, syringes, pasteur pipettes,
broken glass, scalpel blades, disposable razors and suture needles which have come
in contact with infectious agents during use in patient care or in laboratories, must
be rendered unusable and placed in rigid, puncture-resistant containers immediately
after use. The containers of sharp waste shall either undergo incineration (in a Type
4, DEP-approved incinerator) or be processed by grinding (or another similarly
effective method) to eliminate the physical hazard of the sharps and then disposed
of in a sanitary landfill approved by the DEP (or out-of-state equivalent). Either
method shall constitute proper disposal of sharp wastes.
A. The type(s) of infectious waste being generated.
B. The method of infectious waste removal/disposal used by the generator.
§ 175-12 QUINCY CODE § 175-15
175:8
§ 175-16. Permit for transport.
All infectious waste disposal contractors, as defined by this article, involved in the

offensive substances as provided for in MGL c. 111, § 31A.
§ 175-17. Violations and penalties; liability.
C. The company of record contracted to remove and dispose of infectious waste.
A. Failure by a responsible party to properly dispose of infectious waste shall
constitute a violation of this article and as such shall be subject to penalties and/or
fines.

cleanup and proper disposal of infectious waste found to be improperly disposed in
the City.
C. The responsible party or parties shall be assessed a fine of $200 for each separate
offense of the improper disposal of infectious waste. Each individual article of
infectious waste shall be deemed a separate offense and fined as such. [Amended
6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]

[Adopted 4-5-1999 by Order No. 99-019 (Ch. 18.16 of the 1993 Code)]
§ 175-21. Findings.
The potential exists for community exposure to hazardous materials which have been,
are or may be released during City-sponsored projects (such as building expansion,
infrastructure improvements, etc.). In order to minimize (reduce or eliminate) the
potential for hazardous exposure to the public, appropriate site-specific environmental
controls can and should be implemented before and during project implementation.
Effective risk communication through public outreach and notification should
complement actual environmental controls.
§ 175-22. Environmental assessment and control plan.
Any project conducted by or on behalf of the City of Quincy which has the potential to
create a nuisance condition of air pollution and which involves the application, removal,
or repair of any material deemed to be or to contain hazardous materials (including
but not limited to asbestos, lead, petroleum products, etc.) must include a site- and
project-specific environmental assessment and control plan. Review and approval of the
environmental assessment and control plan by the Quincy Health Department must be
received prior to the commencement of the project. The environmental assessment and
control plan must include, at minimum, the following:
§ 175-23. Notification requirements.
A. Project description.
B. Safety and/or health hazard assessment which will evaluate any potential
environmental hazards generated by the project (including pre-monitoring test
requirements and ambient air testing requirements, as applicable). [Amended
6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
C. Operational plan which will include statements and references to the applicable
local, state and federal regulations and include site control and containment
measures (as applicable), along with detailed health and safety procedures that will
be required to be in effect for the duration of the project.
A. For any project which abuts, wholly or in part, any residential structure, or which
has the potential to impact a residential area within the City, a public informational
meeting describing the scope of the project (including anticipated project start and
completion dates), any potential environmental hazards, details of control measures
to be implemented, etc., must be conducted prior to the start of the project. This
section will exclude the repaving of roadways and underground utility work (water/
sewer/drain) within a public or private way.
B. Notification regarding the actual start and completion dates for the project must be
made at least 24 hours prior to the start to appropriate City officials [including but
not limited to the Quincy Health Department (Health Commissioner and/or
Environmental Sanitarian), Quincy Fire Department (Hazardous Materials Officer),
§ 175-21 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS § 175-23
175:13
Mayor's office, and Ward Councillor whose ward includes the project location].
C. Notification regarding any major project change (including procedural changes
with respect to environmental controls) should be made prior to the change,

180:3
§ 180-5. Powers and duties.
14, an Historical Commission shall be appointed by the Mayor. The Commission
shall consist of seven citizens of the City appointed for three-year terms, with the
terms of either two or three members expiring each year. Seven alternate members
shall be appointed in a like manner. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment for an unexpired term. One regular member and one
alternate member respectively shall be appointed from at least three nominees
submitted by the Boston chapter of the American Institute of Architects, from
at least three nominees submitted by the Quincy Historical Society and from at
least three nominees submitted by the South Shore Board of Realtors. One regular
and one alternate member shall be appointed, where possible, from among the
residents or property owners of the historic districts, and three regular and three
alternate members shall be appointed at large. If within 30 days after submission
of a request for nominees to an organization entitled to submit nominations for
membership on the Commission no such nominations have been made, the Mayor
may proceed to make the appointments to the Commission without nomination by
such organization.
B. In case of the absence, inability or unwillingness to act of a member of the
Commission, his or her place shall be taken by an alternate member designated by
the Chairperson. Each member and alternate shall continue in office until the
expiration of his or her term or until his or her successor is duly appointed and
qualified. All members shall serve without compensation. The Commission shall

from within or without its number.
A. The Commission shall, by majority vote of the members thereof, promulgate
appropriate procedural rules and regulations for the calling of meetings, the calling
and conduct of hearings, the issuance and filing of certificates and other
determinations, and the keeping of records, provided that the same shall be
consistent with the requirements of MGL c. 40C, §§ 10 and 11, and other provisions
of this article.
B. The Commission may, after public hearing, set forth in such manner as it may
determine the various designs of certain appurtenances, such as signs or lighting
fixtures, which will meet the requirements of an historic district and a roster of
certain colors of paint and roofing materials which will meet the requirements of an
historic district, but no such determination shall limit the right of an applicant to
present other designs or colors to the Commission for its approval. The Commission
shall, subject to appropriation, prepare and publish architectural and design
guidelines for the construction and alteration of buildings and structures within
historic districts.
C. The Commission may, where certain construction or alteration is otherwise
inappropriate, nevertheless determine that, owing to conditions especially affecting
the building or structure involved, but not affecting the historic district generally,
failure to approve an application will involve a substantial hardship, financial or
otherwise, to the applicant and that such application may be approved without
substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from
the intent and purposes of this article. If the Commission so determines, it shall

Commission as provided in MGL c. 40, § 8D.
F. The Commission shall have, in addition, the powers, authority and duties granted to
it by the ordinance codified in this article, as it may from time to time be amended.
A. When required. Except as otherwise provided in § 180-8 or 180-9, no building or
structure within an historic district shall be constructed or altered in any way that
affects an exterior architectural feature unless the Commission shall first have
issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of nonapplicability or a
certificate of hardship with respect to such construction or alteration.
B. Application; required contents. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from
the Commission shall file with the Commission an application therefor in such form
as the Commission may reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations,
specifications, material or other information, including, in the case of demolition or
removal, a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of the property
thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it
to make a determination on the application.
C. Required for building permit issuance. No building permit for construction of a
building or structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within an
historic district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal of a building or
structure within an historic district shall be issued by the Director of Inspectional
Services until the certificate required by this section has been issued by the
Commission.
A. In passing on matters before it, the Commission shall consider, among other things,
the historic and architectural value and significance of the site, building or structure;
the general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the features
involved; and the relation of such features to similar features of buildings and
structures in the surrounding area. In the case of new construction or additions to
existing buildings or structures, the Commission shall consider the appropriateness
of the size and shape of the building or structure, both in relation to the land area
upon which the building or structure is situated and to buildings and structures in
the vicinity, and the Commission may, in appropriate cases, impose dimensional
and setback requirements in addition to those required by other applicable laws and
ordinances. The Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or
architectural features not subject to public view.

nor to prevent landscaping with plants, trees or shrubs; nor construed to prevent the
meeting of a requirement certified by a duly authorized public officer to be necessary
for public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition; nor construed to prevent
any construction or alteration under a permit duly issued prior to the effective date of the
ordinance codified in this article.

carried forward with due diligence.
B. The Commission may determine from time to time after public hearing that certain
categories of exterior architectural features, if the provisions of applicable laws or
ordinances do not limit the authority of the Commission with respect thereto, may
be constructed or altered without review by the Commission without causing
substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this article.
C. Upon request, the Commission shall issue a certificate of nonapplicability with
respect to construction or alteration in any category then not subject to review by
the Commission in accordance with this section.
A. The Superior Court for Norfolk County may, in accordance with the provisions of
MGL c. 40C, § 13, enforce the provisions of this article and any determination,
ruling or regulation issued pursuant thereto and may, upon the petition of the
Commission or at the request of the Commission or the Director of Inspectional
Services, restrain by injunction violations thereof, and, without limitation, such
court may order the removal of any building, structure or exterior architectural
feature constructed in violation thereof, or the substantial restoration of any
building, structure or exterior architectural feature altered or demolished in
violation thereof, and may issue such other orders for relief as may be equitable.

§ 244-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to promote the public health, safety and welfare by
requiring a minimum level of maintenance of private property to protect the livability,
appearance and social and economic stability of the City and to protect the public from
the health and safety hazards and the impairments of property values that result from the
neglect and deterioration of property.
§ 244-2. Property blight.
The presence of any one or more of the following conditions on property constitutes
property blight:
§ 244-3. Public nuisance.
A. Any condition that is detrimental to the public health, safety or general welfare.
B. Any condition that constitutes a public nuisance as defined herein.
C. Any condition of deterioration or disrepair that creates a substantial adverse impact
on neighboring properties.
A. No person, whether as owner, agent, manager, operator, lessee, tenant, sublessee,
or occupant in possession of a property, shall maintain a blighted property or cause
or permit property to be maintained as a blighted property. No person, whether as
owner, agent, manager, operator, lessee, sublessee, tenant or occupant of a property,
shall take any action or allow any action to be taken at that property in violation of
any provision of this article or any order issued pursuant to the provisions of this
article.
B. Unlawful nuisance; inadequately maintained property. It shall be an unlawful
public nuisance for any person owning, leasing, renting, occupying or having
charge or possession of any commercial and/or residential property to maintain or
allow to be maintained such property in such manner that the following conditions
are found to exist thereon where such conditions are visible from a public right-ofway
and/or neighboring property and such conditions have both a significant
adverse visual impact on the neighborhood and substantially contribute to the
dilapidated or deteriorated appearance of the neighborhood:
(1) Property which is not kept substantially clean and free from accumulations,
including but not limited to rank growth, rubbish, junk, garbage, litter, debris,
flyers or circulars, overgrown, dead or decayed trees, weeds or other
vegetation that constitutes a fire hazard or other condition that is dangerous to
the public health, safety, or welfare; or creates the potential for the harboring
of rats, vermin, vector, or other similar public nuisances; or substantially
detracts from the aesthetic and property values of neighboring properties; or is
overgrown onto a public right-of-way at least 12 inches; or is completely dead,
§ 244-1 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 244-3
244:3

visible from any street.
(2) Buildings or structures or significant sections thereof, including but not limited
to exterior stairs, roof, foundation, walls, fences, signs, retaining walls,
driveways, or walkways, which are substantially broken, deteriorated, or
defaced; or windows or doors which are missing, broken or inadequately
secured that create a hazardous condition or a potential attraction to
trespassers; or exterior walls or roof coverings that have become substantially
deteriorated, do not provide adequate weather protection, or show evidence of
the presence of termite infestation or dry rot. (For the purposes of this section
"defaced" includes, but is not limited to, writings, inscriptions, figures,
scratches, or other markings commonly referred to as "graffiti.")
(3) Property used or intended to be used for residential purposes which contains,
in the outdoor area, any refrigerator, washing machine, sink, toilet, bidet,
stove, heater, boiler, tank or any other household equipment, machinery,
furniture, or item, appliance or appliances, boxes, lumber, dirt or debris, trash,
garbage or refuse cans, or any items other than those commonly stored

consecutive hours. This subsection does not prohibit machinery installed in the
rear setback areas for household or recreational use, furniture designed and
used for outdoor activities, trash cans in the front yard during the twenty-fourhour
period allowed for garbage pickup and garbage bins when employed in
construction for which a valid building permit has been issued by the City.
(4) Where property is vacant and otherwise required to be boarded up, the
boarding shall be done in a manner approved by the Director of Inspectional
Services and which does not itself have a significant adverse visual impact on
the neighborhood nor substantially contribute to the dilapidated or deteriorated
appearance of the neighborhood. To the extent feasible, the boarding up shall
cause the property to have the appearance of an occupied residence or utilized
commercial entity as determined by the Director of Inspectional Services. Any
boarded up property shall be subject to an initial periodic review by the
Director of Inspectional Services with the property owner as to the
circumstances which underlie the presenting condition, which review shall
include the establishment of a written plan and defined timetable for the
rehabilitation or reuse of said property to a useful intended permissible
purpose. Failure of the property owner to participate in said annual review with
a demonstrated effort to mitigate the property conditions shall constitute a
violation of this article. Information regarding the process, substance and
results of this review shall be made available to abutters and the City Council
upon request.
(5) Any property that is unsecured and constitutes an attraction to children or a
harbor for vagrants, criminals or other unauthorized persons, or is in a
condition such that persons can resort thereto for the purpose of committing a
public nuisance or unlawful act, constitutes property blight. A building or
structure is unsecured when either of the following conditions exists:
(a) The building or structure is inhabited, occupied or used without the
§ 244-3 QUINCY CODE § 244-3
244:4
consent of the owner or the agent of the owner; or
(b) Unauthorized persons can readily gain entry to the building or structure
without the consent of the owner or the agent of the owner.
(6) A partially constructed, reconstructed or demolished building or structure
upon which work has been abandoned constitutes property blight. Work is
deemed abandoned when there is no valid current building or demolition
permit for the work or when there has not been any substantial work on the
building or structure for a period of six months or more.
(7) The storage upon any property of building materials unless there is in force a
valid building permit issued by the City for construction upon said property

In no event, however, shall the storage of building materials occur on the
property in excess of 12 months without written consent from the Director of
Inspectional Services. Building materials shall include but shall not be limited
to lumber, bricks, concrete or cinder blocks, plumbing materials, electrical
wiring or equipment, heating ducts or equipment, shingles, mortar, concrete,
nails, screws, steel, or any other materials commonly used in constructing any
structure.

property blight. A property is considered to have a hazardous condition
prohibited by this article if any one or more of the following conditions exists
on the property:

(b) Any condition or object, including without limitation landscaping, motor
vehicles, fencing or signs, that obscures the visibility of traffic,
pedestrians, or street intersections in a manner that constitutes a hazard.

their accessibility to the public, may prove hazardous, including, without

or fails to obey any lawful order issued by the enforcing authority in enforcing this

property to the dilapidated or deteriorated appearance of the neighborhood as
determined by the Director of Inspectional Services.

result in the City's correcting the violation and collecting the charges by billing or
by lien on the property.

request an appeal in order to avoid City abatement and liability for cost of
abatement.

SHOPPING CARTS
§ 282-1. Findings and purpose.
§ 282-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ABANDONED SHOPPING CART Any unattended shopping cart left on a public or
private property outside the premises or parking area of the retail establishment owning
the shopping cart. Any such shopping cart shall be deemed abandoned and, therefore,
a public nuisance pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, the parking
area of a retail establishment located in a multi-store complex, or shopping center, shall
include the entire area used by the complex.
BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT  Includes, but is not limited to, a grocery store,
supermarket, drugstore, pharmacy, dry goods store, department store, discount store,
variety store, or other retail establishment which supplies 20 or more shopping carts for
the use of its customers.
OWNERThe owner or retail establishment whose identification is required to appear
on the shopping cart identification sign.
PUBLIC PROPERTY Includes, but is not limited to, all areas dedicated to the public
use, including roadways, parkways, alleys, lanes, parks, sidewalks and any public rightof-
way.
SHOPPING CART  A basket that is mounted on wheels or a similar device generally
used in a retail establishment by customers for the transporting of goods of any kind.
A. The City Council hereby finds that abandoned shopping carts or parts thereof are
unsightly and aesthetically detrimental to the community, interfere with pedestrian
and vehicular traffic, accumulate over time on private and public property causing
blight and deterioration resulting in reduction in property values, constitute an
attractive nuisance and are detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare.
Therefore, the presence of abandoned shopping carts or parts thereof is declared to
constitute a public nuisance that may be abated as such in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to promote public health,
safety and welfare by prohibiting the abandonment of shopping carts or parts
thereof upon public and private property, thereby alleviating the safety hazards,
unsafe conditions and the impairment of property values resulting from the
abandonment of such carts.
B. This chapter maintains primary responsibility for managing cart service with the
owner of the cart and provides said owners with discretion in determining their
preferred method of retention of said carts upon the owner's premises. These
sections require business establishments utilizing shopping carts or similar devices
and having more than 20 shopping carts on site to install and maintain a system to
retain shopping carts within property boundaries of the business establishment.
§ 278-17 SHOPPING CARTS § 282-3
282:1
§ 282-3. Required signs on shopping carts.
Every owner of a shopping cart shall affix to each shopping cart owned or provided by
the owner a sign that includes the following information:
§ 282-4. Abandonment prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person to cause or permit any shopping cart to be abandoned
on or upon any public property as defined in this chapter or any private property other
than the premises of the owner of said shopping cart.
§ 282-5. Unauthorized removal prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person, either temporarily or permanently, to remove a
shopping cart from the premises of the owner or be in possession of a cart that has been
removed from the premises of the owner without the written consent of the owner. This
provision shall not apply to shopping carts removed as authorized by the owner for the
purposes of repair, maintenance or disposal.
§ 282-6. Shopping cart on-site retention.
All business establishments utilizing shopping carts or similar devices on site shall
install and maintain a system to retain such shopping carts within the property
boundaries of the business. The business shall provide signage in conspicuous locations
notifying shopping cart users of the retention system in place and how said system
operates. Permitted methods of retention shall include any one of the following:
A. Identification of the owner of the shopping cart or the business to which it pertains
or both. No business shall utilize a shopping cart that does not contain its mark or
contains the mark of another business, and no owner or manager of a retail or
wholesale establishment shall allow such use.
B. Notification that the unauthorized removal of the shopping cart from the premises
of the business establishment or the unauthorized possession of the shopping cart is
a violation of the law.
C. A telephone number and address for returning the shopping cart to its owner or to
the business establishment identified thereon.
A. Each method included in this subsection shall be considered to be an example of an
on-site retention method complying with these sections. If the business
establishment has a method for retention that is not delineated as an example herein,
then an owner may submit a plan to the City Clerk that satisfies the intent of these
sections to retain shopping carts on the premises of the business establishment and/
or its parking lot or to ensure the immediate retrieval of shopping carts outside of
the business establishment and/or its parking lot; no plan submitted by an owner to
the City Clerk shall be valid until approved, in writing, by the Board of Licensing
Commissioners. Examples of methods and/or plans are as follows:
(1) A physical barrier, such as bollards, restricting shopping carts to the front
sidewalk or front portion of the business. Physical barriers shall not interfere
with fire lanes, handicap access or similar features.
§ 282-3 QUINCY CODE § 282-6
282:2
§ 282-7. Mandatory plan.
(2) Shopping carts equipped with a protruding vertical arm or similar device
prohibiting the cart from being removed from the interior of the business.
(3) A system which may be mechanical in nature requiring a deposit to use a
shopping cart; the deposit should be of a reasonable amount that would not
deter use of the cart but would encourage return of the cart.
(4) Shopping carts equipped with a wheel locking mechanism that is used in
conjunction with an electronic barrier along the perimeter of the area within
which shopping carts are allowed. The wheel locking mechanism will activate
when the shopping cart crosses the electronic barrier.
(5) An attendant or attendants whose sole responsibility is to manage and/or return
the business establishment's shopping carts from the exterior premises of the
business establishment and areas immediately adjacent thereto to the interior
premises of the business establishment or another exterior area of the business
establishment dedicated to the containment of shopping carts.
(6) Other similar methods or plans submitted by an owner for the approval of the
City Board of Licensing Commissioners which would satisfy the intent of
these sections to retain shopping carts on the premises of the business
establishment and/or its parking lot or to ensure the immediate retrieval of
shopping carts outside of the business establishment and/or its parking lot.
[Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
B. No business establishment shall allow shopping carts to congregate or stack up in
such a manner as to impede ingress to or egress from the business establishment or
any public or private way adjacent to the business establishment.
C. Prior to the close of each business day, every business establishment shall collect
and secure its shopping carts on its premises, including its parking lot. This action
shall be commenced no sooner than 15 minutes prior to the close of each business
day.
A. Every owner of a business subject to this chapter shall prepare, implement and
submit to the City Clerk within 90 days of the adoption of this chapter, and on an
annual basis thereafter, a specific written plan to prevent the removal of shopping
carts from its premises and, if removed, to retrieve the shopping carts that have been
removed within 24 hours of the removal. A business may request an exemption
from the annual plan filing requirement if it is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the City the ability to prevent the carts from leaving the site and no carts are
found abandoned after the exemption is granted.
B. Said plan shall also include, at a minimum, the name of the business, identification
of business address contact information, the names of the persons responsible for
implementing the plan and information on who and how to contact the appropriate
individuals to resolve any plan issues or violations, an inventory of carts, and
employee training on cart removal and abandonment prevention.
C. Said plan shall also include a methodology for customer and community
§ 282-6 SHOPPING CARTS § 282-7
282:3
§ 282-8. Time frame for compliance.
Any business that is nonconforming as to on-site shopping cart retention upon adoption
of this chapter shall comply within six months.
§ 282-9. Exemption.
Any business subject to this chapter that services within 1,000 feet of its premises
a multiunit residential facility of more than 10 units housing handicapped or elderly
residents may seek a limited exemption to this chapter solely for the purposes of
servicing this facility. Said business must submit, to the City Clerk, a written plan
outlining an agreement with such residential facility detailing a methodology for the
systematic retrieval of all shopping carts utilized solely to service this facility.
§ 282-10. Enforcement; violations and penalties. [Amended 6-1-2020 by Order
No. 2020-012]
A determination of compliance and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter shall
reside with the City of Quincy Board of Licensing Commissioners, which shall receive
and review the mandatory plans previously cited (§ 282-7). Failure of an owner to
comply with the provisions of this chapter and an approved mandatory plan shall, in
the first instance, result in a written notice citing such failure and requiring forthwith
compliance. A second such failure to comply may result in the issuance of a monetary
fine of $25 per event. Each day of noncompliance shall constitute a separate event.
notification and outreach that shall include signage on the carts, stores, shopping
bags or other outreach designed to advise its customers that they may not remove
the shopping carts from the business premises. As part of customer outreach the
City would encourage the provision to customers, at wholesale cost, the availability

Access of Minors to Tobacco Products
[Adopted 5-17-1993 as Ch. 8.30 of the 1993 Code; amended in its entirety by
Order No. 94-024]
§ 288-1. Findings; authority. [Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
There exists conclusive evidence that tobacco smoke causes cancer, respiratory diseases,
negative birth outcomes, various cardiac diseases, allergies, and irritations to the eyes,
nose, and throat to both the smoker and the nonsmoker exposed to secondary smoke.
Evidence further demonstrates that tobacco is extremely addictive. More than 3,000
young people begin smoking every day in this nation. Since almost 90% of all smokers
begin smoking before age 18, the legal age to purchase cigarettes in the commonwealth,
there is an important health need to reduce the easy access to tobacco products by youths
through strict enforcement of the state law prohibiting sales to minors. Therefore, these
regulations are adopted pursuant to MGL c. 111, § 31, as reasonable health regulations
designed to protect and improve the health of the residents of the City of Quincy.
§ 288-2. Free distribution prohibited.
No person or entity shall, in or upon any part of the streets, parks, public ground,
public buildings, or other public-owned places within the City of Quincy, distribute any
products containing tobacco for any promotional or other commercial purposes. Tobacco
distribution includes, but is not limited to, bonus in a game, contest or tournament
involving skill or chance, but does not include redemption of coupons distributed in
newspapers or other periodicals or affixed to packaging for products distributed to adults
by tobacco retailers.
§ 288-3. Freestanding displays.
Freestanding displays of tobacco products, from which individual packages may be
selected by the customer, must be within 10 feet and in full view of the regular location
of a person designated to supervise the purchase of tobacco products from the display.
Carton displays must be within full view.
§ 288-4. Sale by persons under age 18.
No person or entity selling tobacco products shall allow anyone under age 18 to sell
cigarettes or other tobacco products until such employee reads the Health Department
and state law regarding sale of tobacco.
§ 288-5. Tobacco sales to minors prohibited.
A. In conformance with MGL c. 270, § 6, no person or entity shall sell a cigarette,
chewing tobacco, snuff, or tobacco in any of its forms to any person under age 18.
B. All clerks selling cigarettes or tobacco products will positively establish the
purchaser's age as 18. A written note or telephone communication from a parent or
guardian will not be sufficient to allow a person under age 18 to purchase a tobacco
product.

establishment or agency shall install or maintain a vending machine to distribute or
sell tobacco products in the City of Quincy unless:
(1) The vending machine is located within the immediate vicinity, plain view and
control of a responsible employee, so that all purchases are observable and
controllable as if cigarettes were sold over the counter; [Amended 6-1-2020
by Order No. 2020-012]
(2) The vending machine must not be located in a coatroom, rest room,
unmonitored hallway, outer waiting area, or similar unmonitored area and
must be inaccessible to the public when the establishment is closed;
(3) The vending machine is equipped with a lock-out device approved by the
Health Department. Said device shall lock out sales from vending machines
unless an employee releases the locking mechanism. The release mechanism
must not allow continuous operations of the vending machine and must not be
accessible to customers. Vending machines should be posted with a sign
stating that the machine is equipped with a lock-out device and identifying the
person(s) to contact to purchase cigarettes from the machine. Veterans' clubs,
fraternal organizations and bars and taverns where food is not the major source
of income are exempt from installing these lock-out devices. These clubs and
bars may apply to the Board of Licensing Commissioners for this exemption;
and
(4) No sales of tobacco products are permitted from a vending machine which also
offers for sale any nontobacco product.
B. All cigarette vending machines must display a conspicuous sign stating that it is
illegal to sell cigarettes to minors, as identified in § 288-7A and B of this article.

tobacco products to persons under age 18 is prohibited. Such notice shall be at least
48 square inches and shall be posted at the cash register which receives the greatest
volume of single cigarette package sales in such a manner that it may be readily
seen by a person standing at or approaching the cash register. Such notice shall be

40, § 21D, and such penalty shall be as specified in § 288-10A, C and D.

30 days following the date of removal.
C. Any person or entity found to be selling tobacco without a license for location of

§ 300-14. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
The Department shall enforce this article, regulations, orders, violation notices, and
enforcement orders and may pursue all civil and criminal remedies for such violations.
A. Civil relief. If a person violates the provisions of this article, regulations, permit,
notice, or order issued thereunder, the Department may seek injunctive relief in a
court of competent jurisdiction restraining the person from activities which would
create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or
remediation of the violation.
B. Orders.
(1) The Department may issue a written order to enforce the provisions of this
article or the regulations thereunder, which may include: elimination of illicit
connections or discharges to the MS4; elimination of excess flow causing
harm or damage to public or private property; performance of monitoring,
analyses, and reporting; annual certification of stormwater management BMPs
permitted under Article II of this chapter; that unlawful discharges, practices,
or operations shall cease and desist; and remediation of contamination in
connection therewith. If the enforcing person determines that abatement of
flow or remediation of contamination is required, the order shall set forth a
deadline by which such abatement or remediation must be completed. Said
order shall further advise that, should the violator or property owner fail to
abate or perform remediation within the specified deadline, the City may, at its
option, undertake such work after advising the owner of the cost associated
with the remediation, and expenses thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(2) Within 30 days after completing all measures necessary to abate the violation
or to perform remediation, the violator and the property owner will be notified
of the costs incurred by the City, including administrative costs. The violator
or property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount or basis
of costs with the Department within 30 days of receipt of the notification of
the costs incurred. If the amount due is not received by the expiration of the
time in which to file a protest or within 30 days following a decision affirming
or reducing the costs, or from a final decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction, the costs shall become an assessment against the property owner
and shall constitute a municipal charges lien on the owner's property for the
amount of said costs. Interest shall begin to accrue on any unpaid costs at the
statutory rate provided in MGL c. 59, § 57, after the 31st day at which the costs
first become due.
C. Criminal penalty. Any person who violates any provision of this article, regulation,
order or permit issued thereunder shall be punished by a fine of not more than
$1,000. Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
D. Noncriminal disposition. As an alternative to criminal prosecution or civil action,
the City may elect to utilize the noncriminal disposition procedure set forth in MGL
c. 40, § 21D, in which case the Commissioner and/or other authorized agent of the
City shall be the enforcing person. The penalty for a violation shall be $300 per
violation. Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall
§ 300-14 QUINCY CODE § 300-14
300:10
constitute a separate offense.
E. Entry to perform duties under this article. To the extent permitted by state law, or if
authorized by the owner or other party in control of the property, the Department of
Public Works and the Health Department, their agents, officers, and employees,
may enter upon privately owned property for the purpose of performing their duties
under this article and regulations and may make or cause to be made such
examinations, surveys or sampling as such Department deems reasonably
necessary.
F. Appeals. Other than those remedies listed in § 300-14C, the decisions or orders of
the Department shall be final. Further relief shall be to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
G. Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any
other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law.

B. Criteria for granting a waiver shall be defined and included as part of the rules and
regulations created or promulgated under § 300-19A of this article.
A. Orders.
(1) The Department may issue a written order to enforce the provisions of this
article or the regulations thereunder, which may include abatement, mitigation,
and compliance measures for violations of this article. The order shall set forth
a deadline by which such abatement or remediation must be completed. Said
order shall further advise that, should the violator or property owner fail to
abate or perform remediation within the specified deadline, the City may, at its
option, undertake such work after advising the owner of the cost associated
with the remediation, and expenses thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(2) Within 30 days after completing all measures necessary to abate the violation
or to perform remediation, the violator and the property owner will be notified
of the costs incurred by the City, including administrative costs. The violator
or property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount or basis
of costs with the Department within 30 days of receipt of the notification of
the costs incurred. If the amount due is not received by the expiration of the
time in which to file a protest or within 30 days following a decision affirming
or reducing the costs, or from a final decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction, the costs shall become an assessment against the property owner
and shall constitute a municipal charges lien on the owner's property for the
amount of said costs. Interest shall begin to accrue on any unpaid costs at the
statutory rate provided in MGL c. 59, § 57, after the 31st day at which the costs

shall be the enforcing person. The penalty for a violation shall be $300 per
violation. Each day or part thereof that such violation occurs or continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
D. Right to enter and inspect. To the extent permitted by state law, or if authorized by
the owner or other party in control of the property, the Department's agents,
officers, and employees may enter upon privately owned property for the purpose
of performing their duties under this article and may make or cause to be made such
examinations, surveys, or sampling the Department deems reasonably necessary to
determine compliance with a permit issued under this article. Enforcement may be
further defined and included as part of the rules, policies or guidelines created or
promulgated under § 300-19A of this article.

Use Regulations
[Adopted 5-17-1993 as Ch. 12.08 of the 1993 Code]
§ 305-12. Definition.
Whenever the word "street" is used in this article, it shall be understood as meaning to
include lanes, alleys, courts, public squares and sidewalks, unless otherwise expressed.
§ 305-13. Street openings. [Added by Order No. 94-226]
A. Permit required. No entity (person, business, utility, or government agency) shall
dig into or break up any public street in the City without first having obtained a
permit from the Commissioner of Public Works. The permit (hereafter known as a
"street opening permit") shall be in a form acceptable to the Commissioner,
consistent with this Code and other laws. The Commissioner may attach general
and specific conditions under which a permit is granted. In all cases, the permit
must be signed by the utility or property owner and contractor.
B. Fee, deposit, bond and insurance.
(1) A nonrefundable application fee of $100 is required.
(2) A refundable deposit of $500, cash or certified check, is required and will be
held until the municipal contractor completes the permanent patch and
payment is received. Interest on retained money is considered to be the
property of the municipality. Trenches not inspected due to the failure of the
permittee to properly notify the governing authority shall be subject to loss of
deposit and/or repeat of reconstruction procedures.
(3) A performance and payment bond of $5,000 is required for each street opening
permit granted. The governing authority may allow a blanket bond
commensurate with anticipated permit activity for routine excavators. Under
no circumstances will this blanket bond be less than $50,000.
(4) The contractor must furnish the municipality with a certificate of insurance for
general liability in the amount of $1,500,000.
C. Notification.
(1) The designated municipal coordinator of the governing authority shall be
notified 24 hours before the commencement of any work.
(2) Dig safe must be notified.
D. Construction procedures.
(1) The pavement shall be pre-cut and may only be disturbed within the area
requiring excavation for repair, replacement or new installation. When the
opening occurs within two feet of the curb and/or edge of the hardened surface,
the paved area between the excavation and the curb and/or edge must also be
removed.
§ 305-12 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 305-13
305:7
(2) In the backfill process, the backfill shall be comprised of suitable material
(subject to approval of the governing authority or his authorized
representative). Concrete should be used around all electric and telephone
conduit in trenches. Controlled density fill (CDF) may be required.
Compaction (when CDF is not in use) will be executed in six-inch layers. Each
layer shall be 95% compacted by mechanical means. When the total surface
area of an individual opening in bituminous concrete is less than nine square
feet, all backfill material(s) will be placed to within a minimum of six inches
of the pavement surface or the thickness of the original pavement structure,
whichever is greater. For individual openings with surface areas of nine square
feet and larger, the backfill materials will be installed to within four inches of
the pavement surface or the thickness of the existing structure, whichever is
greater. "Pavement structure" will incorporate all pervious paving materials
used above the gravel subbase, including but not limited to bituminous
concrete, cement concrete, cobblestone, macadam, etc.
(3) The hardened pavement shall then be cut back and removed six inches to 12
inches from all sides of the initial excavation to the depth of the original
pavement structure, exposing the undisturbed gravel subbase. Edges will be
cut perpendicular to the surrounding surface and have a clean vertical face,
particularly in the corners. All structures shall be leveled to the adjacent
surfaces. The cut back shall be in straight lines with ninety-degree angles at
the point(s) of intersection.
(4) All surplus and/or unacceptable excavated materials shall be removed from the
job site immediately. The excavation site shall be maintained in a clean and
safe condition at all times. Sidewalks and streets shall be cleaned and opened
to traffic at the end of each working day, unless otherwise authorized by the
governing authority. Access to properties is to be maintained. The removal and
disposal of materials, including pavement, is the responsibility of the
permittee. This shall be achieved in such a manner to minimize interference
with pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
(5) The permittee shall be liable for the condition of the street and sidewalk
openings and protection thereof prior to the temporary repair and will be held
responsible for all damage due to any failure of barricades, barriers, warning
signs, lights or steel plates to properly protect the work from traffic,
pedestrians or other causes. Other than while work is actually being
performed, all open ditches shall be protected by uniform traffic control
devices in conformance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
All excavations must be properly secured to ensure the safety of the travelling
public and immediately reported to the designated municipal coordinator.
[Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
(6) Temporary patching shall be performed by a contract representative of the
governing authority and shall be the financial responsibility of the permittee.
All barricades and/or safety devices shall be immediately removed from the
vicinity upon completion of the temporary bituminous patching application.
(7) Any improperly prepared excavations, including those left with unacceptable
backfill material or insufficient pavement depth, shall be temporarily paved by
§ 305-13 QUINCY CODE § 305-13

the municipal contract representative and charged to the refundable deposit
of the permittee. The deposit shall immediately be replenished to the original
amount. At a later date, the trench shall be re-excavated and prepared correctly
by the permittee. Under these conditions the permittee may also be subject to
permit cancellation, inspection fees, fines, and loss of deposit and bond.
(8) All excavations will be required to settle and/or consolidate for a period of
time before the contract representative of the governing authority is directed to
perform a permanent repair. This term will be defined as a minimum of 30
days when controlled density fill was used as backfill material. Compacted
gravel subbase must experience at least one seasonal freeze/thaw cycle. The
governing authority reserves the right to address any subbase deficiency
within, or adjacent to, the original excavated area with whatever measure is
deemed effective during this period. These corrective procedures will be the
financial responsibility of the permittee.
(9) Immediately after the specified settling and/or consolidation period, all
excavations shall be permanently restored by the contract representative for
the governing authority.
(a) The following procedures shall be strictly adhered to:
[1] The infrared process shall be utilized as the primary method of
permanent restoration in bituminous concrete surfaces.
[2] Temporary asphalt patches installed in cement concrete surfaces
shall be re-excavated to the extremities of the square(s) in which the
excavation is contained. The finished concrete shall be replaced to
the depth, strength, and contour of the original structure. Any
concrete surface damaged during construction shall also be replaced
in a like manner.
[3] All other surfaces, including but not limited to asphalt, brick, grass
and wood, shall be replaced consistent with the original and in strict
accordance with municipal specifications.
(b) The permittee shall also be responsible for any and all necessary
appurtenant measures, including but not limited to complete surface
reconstruction, curbing, resetting utility structures, bar holes, compatible
crack filling, tack coating and infrared integration of pavement. All the
required processes shall be determined by a site inspection with an
authorized representative of the governing authority. All restoration
procedures shall be the financial obligation of the permittee.
(10) The permittee shall be responsible for any settlement, subbase failure and
pavement cracks that develop in, or adjacent to, the original excavated area for
a period of three years from the date of the final accepted permanent repair or,
if controlled density fill is used, for a period of one year from the date of the
final accepted permanent repair. Any surface disorder caused by settlement
and/or subbase movement within the general area containing a street or
sidewalk opening shall be addressed by the municipal contract representative,
at the direction of the governing authority. All related corrective measures will
§ 305-13 STREETS AND SIDEWALKS § 305-13
305:9
§ 305-14. Safeguarding of street construction.
be charged to the permittee, and the term of obligation will begin again.
(11) Excavations opened without the permit may be subject to cancellation and
refusal of existing and future permits and associated fines.
(12) Police protection, if required, shall be paid by the permittee either directly or
billed by the municipal representative of the municipality and billed directly to
the permittee.
(13) All surface restorations, bituminous concrete replacements, and permanent
repairs will be done by a contract representative of the municipality and billed
directly to the permittee.
E. Billing and collections.
(1) The contract representative of the municipality shall bill the permittee for the
above-mentioned services. All invoices will be paid within 30 days. On past
due invoices, a service charge of 1 1/2% per month will be allowed on
accounts 30 days past due, provided that the rate does not exceed that which is
permitted by law, in which case the highest allowable legal rate will apply.
Invoices exceeding 90 days shall be paid by the municipality from the
refundable deposit and/or bond, at which point the municipality shall fine the
permittee that cost plus $100 per day and continue to accrue the service
charges on any uncollected moneys together with all costs of collection,
including attorney's fees.
(2) The governing authority reserves the right to assume the billing function,
including assessment and conveyance of reasonable handling charges, as
provided by Massachusetts General Laws.
(a) On ninety-day past due invoices, the municipality will revoke or refuse
existing and future permits until payment of such invoices, including all
service charges and fines. [Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]

B. Tree protection procedures.
(1) Prohibited activities in critical root zone. The following activities are
prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree
subject to the requirements of this chapter:
(a) Material storage. No materials intended for use in construction or waste
materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be placed
within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree.
(b) Equipment cleaning; liquid disposal. No equipment shall be cleaned or
other liquids deposited or allowed to flow overland within the limits of
the critical root zone of a protected tree. This includes, without limitation,
paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar or similar materials.
(c) Tree attachments. No signs, wires or other attachments, other than those
of a protective nature, shall be attached to any protected tree. Fencing
attached to a tree via "U" nails or bent nails is allowed only if the fencing
is parallel to and contiguous with the tree.
(d) Vehicular traffic. No vehicular and/or construction equipment traffic or
parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of any
protected tree other than on existing street pavement. This restriction does
not apply to single-incident access within the critical root zone for
purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and
associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for routine utility
maintenance, emergency restoration of utility service, or routine mowing
operations.
(e) Grade changes. No grade changes shall be allowed within the limits of
§ 311-7 QUINCY CODE § 311-8
311:6
the critical root zone of any protected tree unless adequate construction
methods are approved by the Director of Inspectional Services in
consultation with the City Arborist.
(f) Impervious paving. No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious
materials that may reasonably be expected to kill a tree shall be placed
within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree excepting
trees existing within the public ways.
(2) Prohibited activities in drip line. No heavy equipment, including but not
limited to trucks, tractors, trailers, bulldozers, bobcat tractors, trenchers,
compressors, and hoists, shall be allowed inside the drip line of any protected
tree on any construction site without the specific approval of the Director of
Inspectional Services, excepting public works projects on a public way.
(3) Procedures required prior to construction. The following procedures shall be
followed on all types of construction projects (including, without limitation,
residential, commercial, and municipal/public domain projects):
(a) Protective fencing. Prior to construction, the contractor or subcontractor
shall construct and maintain, for each protected tree on a construction
site, a protective fencing which encircles the outer limits of the critical
root zone of the tree to protect it from construction activity. All protective
fencing shall be in place prior to commencement of any site work and
remain in place until all exterior work has been completed.
(b) Bark protection. In situations where a protected tree remains in the
immediate area of intended construction, exposing the tree bark to danger
of damage by construction equipment or other activity, the contractor or
subcontractor shall protect the tree by enclosing the entire circumference
of the tree with two-inch by four-inch lumber encircled with wire or other
means that do not damage the tree. The intent is to protect the bark of the
tree against incidental contact by large construction equipment.
(4) Construction methods.
(a) Boring. Boring of utilities under protected trees shall be required in those
circumstances where it is not possible to trench around the critical root
zone of the protected tree. When required, the length of the bore shall be
the width of the critical root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum
depth of 48 inches.
(b) Trenching. All trenching shall be designed to avoid trenching across the
critical root zone of any protected tree. The placement of underground
utility lines such as electric, phone, gas, etc., is encouraged to be located
outside of the critical root zone of protected trees. Trenching for an
irrigation system shall be placed outside of the critical root zone, except
the minimum required single head supply line is allowed to extend into
the critical root zone perpendicular to the tree trunk and in the manner
that has the least possible encroachment into the critical root zone.
(c) Root pruning. All roots two inches or larger in diameter which are

exposed as a result of trenching or other excavation shall be cut off square
with a sharp medium-tooth saw and covered with pruning compound
within two hours of initial exposure.
(5) Tree topping/V cutting. It shall be unlawful for any person to "V cut" or top
any tree without having written approval of the Commissioner of Natural
Resources or, under his/her direction, the City Arborist upon determination
that topping the tree is necessary and there is no feasible alternative because
the tree has been severely damaged by storms or other causes, or is under
utility wires or other obstructions, making other pruning practices impractical.
A. Notice of violations. Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be notified by the City Arborist of the specific violation by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery. The notice shall set
forth the nature of the violation and a reasonable time period within which
compliance must be had.
B. Stop-work order.
(1) Upon notice from the City Arborist that work on any lot on which a significant
tree is located is being performed contrary to any applicable mitigation plan or
tree protection plan or any provision of this chapter, such work shall be
immediately stopped by the Director of Inspectional Services or his designee.
The stop-work order shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the
lot involved, or to the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work, and shall
state the conditions under which work will be permitted to resume. [Amended
6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]
(2) Any person who shall continue any work in or about said lot after having been
served with a stop-work order, except such work as that person is directed to
perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall be liable to a fine of
not more than $300. Each day during which a violation exists shall constitute
a separate offense.
C. Injunctive relief. Whenever there exists reasonable cause to believe that a person is
violating any applicable mitigation plan or tree protection plan or any provision of
this chapter, the City may institute a civil action for a mandatory or prohibiting
injunction ordering the defendant to correct the unlawful condition or cease the

may also be authorized as an accessory use by special permit provided such use is
customarily incidental to the main or principal building or use of the land. Any use
not allowed in the district as a principal use is also prohibited as an accessory use.
Accessory uses are permitted only in accordance with lawfully existing principal
uses. In all instances where site plan review and approval is required for a principal

nonconforming use to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to
nonconforming uses may be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals:
1. Change or substantial extension of the use.
2. Change from one nonconforming use to another, equally detrimental or less
detrimental, nonconforming use.
3.4.3. Nonconforming structures. The Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a finding to
reconstruct, extend, alter, or change a nonconforming structure in accordance with
this section only if it determines that such reconstruction, extension, alteration, or
change shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming
structure to the neighborhood. The following types of changes to nonconforming
structures may be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals:
1. Reconstructed, extended or structurally changed.
2. Altered to provide for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose
in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent.
3.4.4. Variance required. Except as provided in Section 3.4.5, below, the reconstruction,
extension or structural change of a nonconforming structure in such a manner as to

extension of an exterior wall at or along the same nonconforming distance within a
required yard, shall require the issuance of a variance from the Zoning Board of
Appeals.
3.4.5. Nonconforming single- and two-family residential structures. Nonconforming
single- and two-family residential structures may be reconstructed, extended,
altered, or structurally changed upon a determination by the Director of
Inspectional Services that such proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or
change does not increase the nonconforming nature of said structure. The following
circumstances shall not be deemed to increase the nonconforming nature of said
structure:
1. Horizontal extensions. Horizontal extensions may be authorized by the
Director of Inspectional Services subject to the following conditions:
a. The proposed extension follows in line with the existing nonconforming
structure where such structure is encroaching on a required rear or side
yard setback.
b. The proposed extension does not encroach any further forward in a
required front yard.
c. The proposed extension complies with all other provisions of this chapter.
2. Vertical extensions. Vertical extensions may be authorized by the Director of
Inspectional Services subject to the following conditions:
3.4 ZONING 3.4
375:11
a. Reconstructed structures shall be built on the original footprint.
b. The height restriction of the respective areas in which these structures are
located will be observed.
Any other type of proposed reconstruction, extension, alteration, or
change may be authorized by the Zoning Board of Appeals by a finding,
upon a determination that the proposed modification will not be
substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming
structure to the neighborhood.
3.4.6. Abandonment or nonuse. A nonconforming use or structure which has been
abandoned, or not used for a period of two years, shall lose its protected status and
be subject to all of the provisions of this chapter.
3.4.7. Catastrophe or demolition. Any nonconforming structure may be reconstructed
after a fire, explosion or other catastrophe, or after voluntary demolition, provided
that such reconstruction is completed within 12 months after such catastrophe or
after such voluntary demolition, and provided that the building(s) as reconstructed
shall be only as great in volume or area as the original nonconforming structure and
located on the original building footprint, unless a larger volume or area or a new
building footprint is authorized by finding from the Zoning Board of Appeals. Such
finding shall be obtained prior to the voluntary demolition of a nonconforming
structure. The time for reconstruction may be extended by the Zoning Board of
Appeals for good cause.
3.4.8. Reversion to nonconformity. No nonconforming use shall, if changed to a
conforming use, revert to a nonconforming use.

name of the business is allowed on the front slope or side valances of the
awning. The front valance may not repeat any of the same sign copy that
is on the storefront sign. This type of awning may be lit by electric/neon/
gas light. (See "backlit awning.") Sign copy may be either painted on or
affixed to the awning.
2. Banner signs. All banner signs are to be considered temporary signs, and a
permanent structure shall be allowed only by special permit from the Planning

less than half the distance of the frontage.
9. Roof sign. Roof signs are not allowed in the City of Quincy. Mansard facades,
pent eaves, and architectural projections shall not be considered to be roof

part of the structure and as such is a hardship and said building meets the
criteria to be located in a commercial arterial area as provided in Section
5.3.11 and the proponent receives a permit from the Planning Board.
[Amended 6-1-2020 by Order No. 2020-012]

violating signs and be held harmless in doing so.
b. All political signs located on private property shall be installed only with
the permission of the property owner(s).
13. (Reserved)
14. City or nonprofit signs. Temporary signs or banners used by the City or for a
nonprofit corporation for holidays, public demonstrations or promotions of
civic welfare or charitable purposes or civic events shall be exempt from these
regulations as long as they meet safety considerations as determined by the
Department of Inspectional Services.
15. Real estate signs. "For sale" or "for lease" signs on commercial property must
be in accordance with the provisions of this section.
16. Signs on businesses and storefronts without windows. Up to a maximum of
25% or 50 square feet is allowed for main signage per the current sign code.
For example, a storefront of 10 feet by 50 feet equals 500 square feet by 25%
equals 125 square feet for the main sign which would still be allowed a
maximum of 50 square feet for the largest main sign. For storefronts without
windows, using the above example, the 500 feet minus the fifty-square-foot
maximum leaves 450 square feet allowed for additional signs for a store or
business with no windows. With no windows, a store or business may then
have additional signs equal to 10% of the remaining space. In the example
given, then, 45 more square feet of signs would be allowed for additional
exterior signs. It could be either one sign of 45 square feet or two secondary
wall signs of 22.5 square feet, for example.
17. Business parking area signs. Where a business or store has its own private
parking lot, a sign or signs may be erected to alert the general visitor that the
parking space(s) is reserved for that business's use only. These signs may be
handled in two ways: by individual signs at each designated parking space or
5.3 QUINCY CODE 5.3
375:28
by one large wall sign which is meant to be read by all potential parkers. For
individual spaces, a sign with a maximum size of 12 by 18 inches is allowed
per space, such sign either wall mounted or in a freestanding mounting, such as
found in a parking meter. For one large wall sign, the amount of space allowed
is one square foot of sign per parking space to a maximum of 50 square feet.
18. Supermarket temporary paper signs. Supermarkets may have the following
temporary paper signs per each window:
a. A sign or signs of any dimension and shape which comprise no more than
60% of the total area of each window are allowed. In each window,
supermarkets will be permitted to use the largest paper sign or
combination of signs which comes closest to but does not exceed 60% of
the total window surface. However, they must still remain within the total
allowable sign area permitted for the building.
19. Signs for businesses with more than one main entrance. Where a business has
more than one main entrance (a regular facade or doorway for the use of the
general public or specific customers to enter to do business at that
establishment, but not incidental side door, employee entrance, or a casual rear
entrance), the business owner may erect another main business sign at the
other main entrance as long as the business follows the general rules and size
guidelines for main business signs.
20. Signs for businesses with rear wall(s) facing arterial roadways/state highways/
public parking lots/public ways. Where a business is located in such a way that
the rear or side of the business faces state highways, major arterial roadways,

5.3.11. Special regulations; commercial arterial areas. Commercial arterial areas are
highway-type establishments, set back on what is called an arterial roadway. An
arterial roadway is normally one which is characterized by having at least four lanes
of two-way traffic, generally with a street width of at least 60 feet. Such areas
generally possess the following attributes: (1) a deep setback from the property line,
usually at least 20 feet; and (2) a highway orientation with provision for onpremises,
off-street parking, generally for a minimum of cars; and (3) buildings on
these ways are usually freestanding, that is, they are generally separated from each
other and not physically connected with lot lines normally allowing for space
between the individual buildings; and (4) building frontage on a commercial arterial
way normally does not extend fully to the edges of the entire lot frontage. Signs in
commercial arterial areas shall conform to all of the other sign regulations for the
entire City as previously listed in this Section 5.3 except as may be superseded
below:
1. For a single business located in one building on a lot:
a. One freestanding sign (ground, pole or like type sign) per building, such
sign set back a minimum of six feet from the property line. Such
freestanding sign may have a maximum of two faces. No freestanding
sign on a building shall exceed 75 square feet in total area, nor shall it
exceed 25 feet in overall height from the top of the sign to the pavement.
The copy on any such sign shall be a minimum of 24 inches above grade
level. No more than one ground sign visible to the major artery is
allowed. Each single business may have up to three additional other signs
(from the approved list) affixed directly to the building. If the business
chooses not to erect a freestanding sign, it shall however be limited to the
maximum of three signs referred to above.
2. For multiple businesses located in one building:
a. One freestanding sign (ground, pole or like type sign) per building. Such
freestanding sign may have a maximum of two faces. No freestanding
sign on a building shall exceed 75 square feet in total area, nor shall it
exceed 25 in overall height from the top of the sign to the pavement. The
5.3 ZONING 5.3
375:33
copy on any such sign shall be a minimum of 24 inches above grade level.
No more than one ground sign visible to the major artery is allowed. Each
individual business may have its own recognition on the pole sign.
b. Each individual business may also affix up to the three signs (from the
approved list) allowed in commercial contiguous areas; however, these
businesses being located in the same physical building must have the
same type of sign design for the entire building structure. All signs on the
main building sign band or comparable architectural feature must be of
the same type. The determination of the main sign type on such buildings
will be the decision of the building owner/landlord.
3. For multiple businesses located in more than one building:
a. One freestanding sign (ground, pole or like type sign) per business center.
Such freestanding sign may have a maximum of two faces. No
freestanding sign on a building shall exceed 75 square feet in total area,
nor shall it exceed 25 feet in overall height from the top of the sign to the
pavement. The copy on any such sign shall be a minimum of 24 inches
above grade level. No more than one ground sign visible to the major
artery is allowed. Each individual business may have its own recognition
on the pole sign.
b. Each individual business may also affix up to three signs (from the
approved list) as allowed in commercial contiguous areas. The main sign
band type allowed on each building shall be the decision of the landlord/
building owner.
5.3.12. Administration and enforcement.
1. Maintenance of signs. All signs and their appurtenances shall be kept in good
repair and safe condition. Low-maintenance materials shall be used for
permanent signs. The surface to which the sign is affixed shall be properly
maintained. It shall be repaired so as to provide a safe, structurally sound,
noneroding, nondeteriorating surface, with no loose or dangling parts. If any
sign is deemed to be unsafe by the Department of Inspectional Services, it shall
be repaired, or removed immediately by the property owner.
2. Inspection. The Department of Inspectional Services shall require compliance
with the standards and conditions set forth in this Section 5.3. If a sign is found
to be in noncompliance, the owner shall be so notified by the Department of
Inspectional Services and the owner shall bring the sign into compliance
within 30 days of notification. In the case of abandoned signs, the current
property owner of record shall be responsible for removing the sign.
3. Temporary signs. If a business owner or landlord does not remove temporary
signs as required by this Section 5.3, then the Department of Inspectional
Services will issue a warning ticket to that person regarding removal. If there
is no action taken by the owner or landlord to remove the sign within two
business days, the Department of Inspectional Services may then issue a ticket
for violation of this Section 5.3 for $50. If no action is taken within two further
business days, another ticket may be issued for $100 and each day thereafter

deemed to be abandoned by the Department of Inspectional Services must be
removed from the premises by the owner of the premises upon cessation of the
business, activity, trade, product or service unless the sign has been declared
historic by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Historic Commission. After
three months, the sign and its attachments and/or appurtenances must be taken
down immediately or made to blend in with the existing building facade. In
the event that the owner fails to comply, the City may enter onto the property
to implement the measures set forth above. In the event the City incurs
expense, the owner shall promptly reimburse the City for all reasonable
expenses associated therewith; if the owner fails to so reimburse the City, the
City may place a lien on the property or any improvement thereon to secure
such payment.
5.3.13. Special permit. By special permit pursuant to Section 9.4, the Planning Board
may authorize signs of greater size or number than otherwise set forth in this
Section 5.3, provided that such relief shall not result in substantial detriment. Signs
of a different type than that otherwise allowed shall require a variance.

7.1. Affordable housing.
7.1.1. Applicability. This Affordable Housing Ordinance, Section 7.1, and all of the
provisions contained herein, shall apply to all projects where a special permit and/
or variance and/or site plan approval is sought from any City of Quincy board or
body to construct a residential building project of 10 units or more. For the purposes
of this Affordable Housing Ordinance, such projects shall be referred to as
"inclusionary projects." The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall apply to all
inclusionary projects in all zoning districts of the City.
1. The provisions of Section 7.1 shall not apply to urban renewal uses.
7.1.2. Requirements. A developer of an inclusionary project shall, concurrent with filing
any application for any special permit, variance or site plan approval within the City
of Quincy, file with the Affordable Housing Trust Committee (AHTC) a
description of the inclusionary project and the special permit(s) and/or variance(s)
and/or site plan approval(s) sought. Filing such descriptions with the Department of
Planning and Community Development shall be considered filing with the AHTC.
Within 35 days of receipt of such descriptions by the Department of Planning and
Community Development and/or the AHTC, the AHTC shall provide, to any
special permit granting or variance granting or site plan approval granting authority
(hereinafter, the "granting authority") considering the inclusionary project, the
AHTC's recommendations for conditions on the inclusionary project. The granting
authority receiving such recommendations shall give great weight to the
recommendations of the AHTC in determining what conditions shall be applied to
the inclusionary project and any relevant special permits or variances or site plan
approval.
1. If the Affordable Housing Trust Committee fails to provide a recommendation
to the granting authority within 35 days of the AHTC receiving an inclusionary
project description, such granting authority may proceed in acting upon the
special permits and/or variances and/or site plan approval sought without the
recommendation of the AHTC. In all cases, the granting authority shall retain
the ultimate authority to determine what, if any, conditions shall be placed on
an inclusionary project pursuant to this Affordable Housing Ordinance.
7.1.3. Affordable Housing Trust Committee. The AHTC may consider any plans,
presentations, or requests of developers in determining what conditions should be
applied to inclusionary projects. However, the AHTC shall not be bound by such
plans, presentations, or requests. Although the AHTC may recommend any
conditions that it deems appropriate based on the description of each individual
inclusionary project, the AHTC shall consider the following guidelines in making
its recommendations for conditions on inclusionary projects:
1. Projects that consist in total of fewer than 10 dwelling units shall not be
considered inclusionary projects and no contribution to City affordable
housing shall be required.
7.1 ZONING 7.1
375:55
2. Rental inclusionary projects. Any inclusionary project that creates or is
designed to create residential rental units shall be designated a "rental
inclusionary project" under this Section 7.1. Although the AHTC shall use its
judgment to recommend appropriate conditions in each individual case, when
a developer presents a rental inclusionary project to the AHTC, the AHTC will
give particular consideration to the following conditions. The developer may
be required to:
a. Create or cause to be created affordable housing units for occupancy
exclusively by eligible households;
b. Donate land to be used exclusively for the development of affordable
housing units; or
c. Undertake such other reasonable creation of affordable housing units or
donation in lieu of such creation as may be recommended by the AHTC.
3. When the AHTC chooses to proceed under Section 7.1.3.2.a, the developer
will generally be required to provide as affordable housing units 10% of all of
the housing units contained in the rental inclusionary project.
4. When the AHTC chooses to proceed under Section 7.1.3.2.b, the developer
will generally donate land of at least an equal appraised value to the value of
10% of all of the housing units contained in the rental inclusionary project.
5. When the AHTC chooses to proceed under Section 7.1.3.2.c, the developer
will generally be required to create affordable housing units, or donate cash in
lieu of such creation, at a cost to the developer no greater than an amount equal
to 50% of the total construction costs of 10% of the total units developed. Such
a contribution or donation shall be determined and administered as described
below.
6. For-sale inclusionary projects. Any inclusionary project that creates or is
designed to create residential units for owner occupancy shall be designated a
"for-sale inclusionary project" under this Section 7.1.3. Although the AHTC
shall use its judgment to recommend appropriate conditions in each individual
case, when a developer presents a for-sale inclusionary project to the AHTC,
the AHTC will give particular consideration to the following conditions:
a. The developer of a for-sale inclusionary project may be required to
contribute to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, in cash, an amount
equal to 50% of the total construction costs of 10% of the total units
developed. This contribution shall be designated the "fee in lieu of
dwelling units."
b. When a developer is required to comply with Subsection a above as part
of the issuance of a variance or a special permit, the developer shall
deliver the fee in lieu of dwelling units to the Chairperson of the City of
Quincy AHTC or his/her designee to be added to the Affordable Housing
Trust Fund. The fee in lieu of dwelling units shall be determined as
follows.
7.1 QUINCY CODE 7.1
375:56
c. As the basis for determining the amount of the fee in lieu of dwelling
units and for determining the building construction cost data, the
Department of Inspectional Services shall use the methods used at that
time by the Department of Inspectional Services to calculate building
permit fees. The Department of Inspectional Services shall calculate 50%
of the total construction cost of 10% of the total units constructed in the
inclusionary project by using total construction cost data appropriate for
the relevant type of unit construction. The resulting dollar value, rounded
to whole dollars, shall be the fee in lieu of dwelling units. The payment
of the fee in lieu of dwelling units shall be made in accordance with the
completion schedule contained in Subsection 7.1.6 of this Section 7.1. All
building permits related to inclusionary projects shall be reviewed by the
Director of Inspectional Services.
7.1.4. Monitoring compliance with AHTC conditions.
1. Any condition placed on any special permit or variance or site plan approval
pursuant to a recommendation of the AHTC or pursuant to this Affordable
Housing Ordinance shall be deemed an affordable housing condition.
2. Prior to issuance of an occupancy permit.
a. The AHTC shall oversee and monitor compliance with all affordable
housing conditions. In order to facilitate this process, until an occupancy
permit has been issued for any inclusionary project subject to an
affordable housing condition, the recipient of the special permit(s) and/or
variance(s) and/or site plan approval containing the affordable housing
condition(s) shall periodically, on January 1 and July 1 of each year,
report to the AHTC regarding compliance with any and all affordable
housing conditions. Such reporting shall continue until an occupancy
permit has been issued for the inclusionary project.
b. Periodic reports to the AHTC shall be designed to inform the AHTC on
the general progress of development on the inclusionary project and to
specifically inform the AHTC regarding compliance with any affordable
housing condition. Based upon these periodic reports, or upon any other
information, and prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the
inclusionary project, the AHTC shall report to the granting authority
regarding the status of the implementation of such affordable housing
condition. The granting authority shall require and enforce compliance
with all affordable housing conditions. The granting authority shall
consider the reports and recommendations of the AHTC in considering
whether or not a developer has complied with conditions placed on an
inclusionary project. When the granting authority determines that an
inclusionary project is not in compliance with an affordable housing
condition, the granting authority shall have all of the remedies available
to it in the case of violation of any other type of condition, including
revocation of the variance or special permit or site plan approval.
c. Prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit for any inclusionary project
subject to an affordable housing condition, the Affordable Housing Trust
7.1 ZONING 7.1
375:57
Committee shall designate, consistent with any affordable housing
conditions, which properties or property interests contained in the
inclusionary project are subject to continuing affordable housing
requirements after the issuance of the occupancy permit. Such properties
or property interests shall be known as the "designated property," and any
entity having any ownership interest in any designated property shall be
known as a "designated owner."
d. Prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit for any inclusionary project
subject to an affordable housing condition, the AHTC shall notify each
designated owner that his property is a designated property. The
inclusionary project permit and/or variance and/or site plan approval
recipients shall be responsible for providing the AHTC with a list of all
designated owners, at the AHTC's request. Failure of the AHTC to give
such notice, however, shall not affect the validity of any affordable
housing condition. Such notice shall notify the designated owner of the
affordable housing condition of any obligations under the affordable
housing condition and this Affordable Housing Ordinance.
3. After the issuance of an occupancy permit.
a. The AHTC shall oversee and monitor compliance with all affordable
housing conditions. In order to facilitate this process, after an occupancy
permit has been issued for any inclusionary project subject to an
affordable housing condition, all designated owners of designated
property contained within the inclusionary project shall report annually,
on July 1, to the AHTC regarding compliance with the relevant affordable
housing condition. This reporting obligation shall attach to the owner of
any designated property. When designated property, or any interest in
designated property, is transferred, the transferee shall assume the
reporting obligations described herein and any other obligations
contained in the affordable housing condition.
b. Annual reports to the AHTC shall be designed to inform the AHTC
regarding compliance with any affordable housing condition. Based upon
these annual reports, or upon any other information, the AHTC may
report to the granting authority regarding compliance with the affordable
housing condition. The granting authority shall require and enforce
compliance with all affordable housing conditions. The granting authority
shall consider the reports and recommendations of the AHTC in
considering whether or not a developer has complied with conditions
placed on an inclusionary project. When the granting authority
determines that an inclusionary project is not in compliance with an
affordable housing condition, the granting authority shall have all of the
remedies available to it in the case of violation of any other type of
condition, including revocation of the variance or special permit or site
plan approval.
4. Pursuant to an affordable housing condition, and prior to the issuance of an
occupancy permit, the AHTC, with the approval of the Mayor of the City of
Quincy, may enter into any agreements with the designated owners, or with
7.1 QUINCY CODE 7.1
375:58
any other party, that it deems necessary to comply with the affordable housing
condition, including agreements regarding mortgages, deed restrictions, rental
limitations, or any other limitation contained in the affordable housing
condition.
5. The AHTC may, at any time, remove any property or property interest from
the list of designated properties and may terminate the obligations of any
designated property or designated owner under any affordable housing
condition, as long as such removal and termination is in the public interest and/
or consistent with the purposes of this Affordable Housing Ordinance. Such
removal and termination shall be reported to the relevant granting authority
and shall be considered incorporated into the relevant affordable housing
condition.
7.1.5. Fractional dwelling unit. Where the application of any formula contained in this
Section 7.1 results in a fractional dwelling unit, a fraction of 1/2 of a dwelling unit
or more shall be considered as one full dwelling unit. A fraction of less than 1/2 of
a dwelling unit shall not be considered a dwelling unit. Each affordable housing
unit shall meet the standards established in Subsection 7.1.7 of this Section 7.1.
7.1.6. Construction of affordable housing units. For any construction of affordable
housing units under this Affordable Housing Ordinance in which affordable
housing units are part of a project containing market-rate units, the affordable
housing units may be required to be provided coincident with the development of
the market-rate units, but in no event shall the development of the affordable units
be delayed beyond the schedule below. In addition, any land, moneys or property
(or any other housing units) to be provided under this Section 7.1 shall be provided
at least at the rate described below:
Percent of Completed Market
Rate Units
Minimum Percentage of Completed
Affordable Units
(or minimum percentage of land, property
or moneys to be provided)
Up to 30% None required
30% + 1 unit 10%
50% + 1 unit 30%
65% + 1 unit 50%
75% + 1 unit 70%
90% + 1 unit 100%
7.1.7. Standards for construction and occupancy of affordable units. Affordable units
shall be generally comparable in size, number of bedrooms, and materials to
dwelling units in the neighborhood or in the project in which they are located and
shall be consistent with local needs for affordable housing. Preference for
affordable housing units shall be given to Quincy residents whenever possible.
7.1.8. Occupancy. Solely for the purposes of this Affordable Housing Ordinance,
"occupancy" shall mean the inhabiting and use of a housing unit, including change
7.1 ZONING 7.1
375:59
of tenants or residents in a housing unit.
7.1.9. Affordable Housing Trust Committee. The City shall establish an Affordable
Housing Trust Committee (AHTC).
1. The AHTC shall consist of 13 members, as follows, one of whom shall be a
permanent member and 12 of whom shall be appointed for staggered terms of
five years:
a. One permanent member. The Director of Planning and Community
Development or his/her designee shall serve ex officio as permanent
Chairperson of the AHTC and shall serve ex officio as the Trustee of the
Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
b. Members appointed for staggered five-year terms. The Mayor of the City
of Quincy shall appoint to the AHTC 12 members for staggered five-year
terms. The Mayor shall appoint:
1. One member with a background in banking;
2. One member with a background in residential development;
3. One member from the executive board of the Quincy and south
shore building trades;
4. Two members from faith-based organizations;
5. Two members from City of Quincy designated community housing
development organizations;
6. Two community members of the Mayor's choosing; and
7. Three members consisting of the Quincy City Councilors serving on
the City Council Housing Committee.
All nonpermanent members of the Affordable Housing Trust
Committee shall be considered special municipal employees. At all
times at least 10 of the 12 nonpermanent members of the AHTC
shall be residents of the City of Quincy. The AHTC may seek
technical and administrative assistance from the Department of
Planning and Community Development, the Director of Inspectional
Services, and the City Solicitor's office.
2. The AHTC shall have the following authority:
a. The AHTC shall administer the Affordable Housing Ordinance and shall
have all of the power and authority granted to it under this Affordable
Housing Ordinance. The AHTC shall review descriptions of inclusionary
projects and may make recommendations to permit granting and variance
granting authorities regarding conditions to be placed on inclusionary
project permits and variances. Such recommendations shall be made by
the AHTC upon the vote of a majority of the AHTC members attending
any AHTC meeting at which there is a quorum. The AHTC shall
additionally monitor compliance with conditions placed on inclusionary
7.1 QUINCY CODE 7.1
375:60
projects pursuant to this Affordable Housing Ordinance and/or on
recommendation of the AHTC and shall report to the granting authority
on compliance with those conditions. Such reports shall be approved by
the AHTC by a vote of a majority of the AHTC members attending any
AHTC meeting at which there is a quorum.
b. The AHTC shall seek, through its recommendations to permit granting
and variance granting authorities, and through its administration of
affordable housing and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to provide
affordable housing to low- and moderate-income families. In furtherance
of this goal, on July 1 of each year the AHTC shall define "income
eligible households" and such definition shall remain in place until July 1
of the following year. The AHTC shall seek, through this Affordable
Housing Ordinance, to provide affordable housing to qualifying income
eligible households.
7.1.10. Income eligible households. When affordable housing conditions are placed on
inclusionary projects that require occupancy of any housing unit by an income
eligible household, the definition of "income eligible household" in place at the
time of the initial occupancy by each successive household shall be the controlling
definition. When such conditions are placed on inclusionary projects, the following
requirements shall apply:
1. Rental inclusionary projects. When any designated property is used as a rental
unit, and when any affordable housing condition requires occupancy of that
rental unit by an income eligible household, the affordable housing unit shall
be administered in the following way:
a. The AHTC shall annually, on July 1, establish guidelines setting the
minimum and maximum rent that may be charged to an income eligible
household occupying a designated property.
b. As part of the designated owner's annual report to the AHTC after the
issuance of an occupancy permit, the designated owner shall report on the
income eligible status of the occupant(s) of the designated property.
Based on such reports, or on any other information, and consistent with
the definition of "income eligible household" in place at the time of such
report, the AHTC shall determine annually whether or not the occupant(s)
of a designated property used as a rental unit continue(s) to qualify as an
income eligible household. In cases where the occupant(s) no longer
qualify(ies) as an income eligible household, the occupant(s) shall be
given no less than 12 months to vacate the designated property. In cases
where the occupant(s) continue(s) to qualify as an income eligible
household, the occupant(s) may remain the occupant(s) of the designated
property, so long as such occupancy is consistent with the affordable
housing condition.
2. For-sale inclusionary projects. When any designated property is used as an
owner-occupied unit, and when any affordable housing condition requires
occupancy of that for-sale inclusionary project unit by an income eligible
household, the affordable housing unit shall be administered in the following
7.1 ZONING 7.1
375:61
way:
a. The AHTC shall annually, on July 1, establish guidelines setting the
minimum and maximum purchase price that may be charged for any
designated property that is to be owner occupied.
b. In no case shall the purchase price of such for-sale designated property be
more than 70% of the fair market value of the designated property. When
a designated property is sold to an income eligible household, the seller
shall report to the AHTC the fair market value of the designated property
at the time, the purchase price of the designated property, and the
percentage difference between the fair market value and the purchase
price (the "affordable housing percentage").
7.1.11. Subsequent sales. Once the designated property has been purchased by an income
eligible household (the "initial purchase"), the income eligible household shall then
be free to sell the designated property for fair market value (the "second sale"). The
income eligible household shall not sell the designated property for less than fair
market value, however, at the second sale. Upon the second sale of the designated
property for fair market value, the seller shall pay a percentage, equal to the
affordable housing percentage, of the purchase price to the Affordable Housing
Trust Fund, unless the fair market value of the designated property at the time of
the second sale is less than the fair market value of the designated property at the
time of the initial purchase, in which case no money shall be due to the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund. Once a second sale has taken place on a designated property,
all affordable housing conditions and all limitations and obligations upon the
designated property pursuant to this Affordable Housing Ordinance shall terminate.
1. As part of the designated owner's annual report to the AHTC after the issuance
of an occupancy permit, the designated owner shall report on any deed
restrictions and mortgages on the designated property and on any potential sale
of the designated property. The designated owner shall ensure, in the case of a
transfer of the designated property, through deed restrictions that the
requirements of this Affordable Housing Ordinance are adhered to. Once a
second sale has taken place on a designated property, however, all affordable
housing conditions, deed restrictions, and all limitations and obligations upon
the designated property pursuant to this Affordable Housing Ordinance shall
terminate.
2. The AHTC may promulgate, upon a vote of 2/3 of the AHTC members present
at any AHTC meeting at which there is a quorum, guidelines, for distribution
to developers, regarding the requirements of the Affordable Housing
Ordinance and the provision of affordable housing units within the City of
Quincy. Although these guidelines will not be binding upon developers, the
guidelines will be considered by the AHTC and the granting authority in
determining what, if any, conditions should apply to each inclusionary project.
3. The AHTC will be deemed to have a quorum whenever seven or more of the
13 members of the AHTC are present at a meeting.
4. Once the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is established, the AHTC shall
administer the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
7.1 QUINCY CODE 7.1
375:62
5. Upon a vote of 2/3 of the members of the AHTC present at any meeting at
which there is a quorum, the AHTC may vote to accept funds, housing units,
land, or property conveyed to the City of Quincy pursuant to this Affordable
Housing Ordinance. However, in the case of the acceptance or purchase of any
housing units, land or property under this Affordable Housing Ordinance such
acceptance or purchase shall not become effective until such acceptance or
purchase is referred to the City Council and approved consistent with all of the
requirements of law.
6. Upon a vote of 2/3 of the members of the AHTC present at any meeting at
which there is a quorum, the AHTC may vote to disburse or sell any or all of
the funds, housing units, land or property contained within the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund. However, in the case of the sale or disbursement of any
housing units, land or property under this Affordable Housing Ordinance, such
sale or disbursement shall not become effective until such sale or disbursement
is referred to the City Council and approved consistent with all of the
requirements of law. Any sale or disbursement of funds, housing units, land or
property from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund must be, in the reasonable
judgment of the AHTC, consistent with and pursuant to the goals contained in
this Affordable Housing Ordinance. The AHTC may vote to disburse or sell
any funds, housing units, land or property contained within the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund for any other purpose only upon a finding by the AHTC
that such a sale or disbursement is in the public interest, a unanimous vote of
all of the AHTC board members in favor of such a disbursement or sale, and
approval by the Mayor of the City of Quincy. In addition, such sale or
disbursement shall not become effective until such sale or disbursement is
referred to the City Council and approved consistent with all of the
requirements of law.
7. Unless specifically stated otherwise in this Affordable Housing Ordinance, all
actions of the AHTC shall be taken upon the vote of a majority of the members
of the AHTC present at any meeting at which there is a quorum.
7.1.12. Affordable Housing Trust Fund. The City shall establish an Affordable Housing
Trust Fund for the deposit of any funds, housing units, land or property generated
by this Affordable Housing Ordinance. Until and unless such an Affordable
Housing Trust Fund is established, any funds, housing units, land or property
acquired by the City pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be acquired through and
placed into the City's general fund, and the general fund shall function in place of
the Affordable Housing Trust Fund for the purposes of this Affordable Housing
Ordinance. Acquisition and distribution of any funds, housing units, land, or
property acquired by the City pursuant to this Section 7.1 and placed in the City's
General Fund shall be subject to all of the usual requirements of law regarding
acquisition and disbursement of funds, housing units, land or property by the City.
Funds, housing units, land, and property deposited in the Affordable Housing Trust
Fund may be used for any purpose pursuant to and consistent with this Affordable
Housing Ordinance, including the following:
1. Creation of affordable housing units through a variety of means, including but
not limited to the provision of favorable financing terms or direct write down
of costs for either nonprofits or for-profit developers or to subsidize the
7.1 ZONING 7.1
375:63
7.2. Sober houses. [Added 10-16-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-139]
purchase of sites, existing structures, or affordable units within a larger
development.
2. Multifamily rehabilitation programs.
3. Limited equity cooperatives.
4. Condominium conversions.
7.1.13. Adoption of prior acts of the AHTC. All votes, decisions, and other actions of the
Affordable Housing Trust Committee taken prior to February 17, 2004, shall
continue in full force and effect unless specifically rejected by the Affordable
Housing Trust Committee after that date, by a vote of 2/3 of the AHTC members
present at any meeting at which there is a quorum.
7.2.1. Purpose.
1. The purpose of this section is to address issues relating to sober houses in
Quincy. Structured sober houses provide housing for individuals in recovery
from addiction to drugs and/or alcohol, including people who may have cooccurring
mental health issues, as they transition from the treatment setting to
life in the community. This housing assists individuals to return to the
community through support in an alcohol- and drug-free, home-like
environment.
2. This section is intended to protect the residents of sober houses from operators
who engage in abuse, neglect, mistreatment, fraud, and/or inadequate
supervision of this vulnerable population as well as to protect the residents of
structured sober living homes and the neighboring community from operators
who fail to provide a supportive, residential family-like living environment
necessary for the residents to achieve and maintain sobriety, in a manner
consistent with the reasonable expectations of residents living where sober
houses are located in regard to their quality of life.
7.2.2. Definitions. As used herein, the following terms shall have the following
meanings.
OPERATORA company, business or individual who provides services to or for
a sober house, including the placement of individuals in a residence, setting house
rules, and/or governing the behavior of occupants while residents of the home. An
operator does not include a property owner or property manager that exclusively
handles real estate contracting, property management, and leasing of the property
and who does not receive compensation for services under the first sentence, above.
PARKING PLANA plan that provides for adequate off-street parking to ensure
that residents of the sober house and abutting residents can safely and conveniently
park their vehicle(s).
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION  A change, adaptation or modification
of Quincy zoning regulations to allow a person seeking to take advantage of sober
housing to reasonably do so in the City of Quincy.
7.1 QUINCY CODE 7.2
375:64
SOBER HOUSE  A dwelling unit occupied by more than four persons, all of
whom are in recovery from chemical dependency and considered handicapped
under the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, that provides a
noninstitutional residential environment in which the residents willingly subject
themselves to written rules and conditions, including prohibition of alcohol and
drug use (except for prescription medications obtained and used under medical
supervision), intended to encourage and sustain their recovery.
7.2.3. Regulation and oversight.
1. Registration required. No sober house may operate within the City without
first obtaining a registration as provided in this section. No person shall open
or operate a sober house or work for a sober house in the City until the

operator of any sober house in the City shall be responsible for updating all
required information on a monthly basis, as necessary. Application for this
registration shall be made within 60 days of the effective date of this section
by any current operator, and within 30 days of the date of application for an
occupancy permit for all new operators.
2. Registration application.

number;
4. If the operation of the sober house involves a lease, a copy of the
lease then currently in effect;
5. The operation plan for the sober house, including supervisory roles
and responsibilities, all plans that facilitate the rehabilitative process
and those that address the maintenance and control of the property,
including parking, noise abatement and the like, all consistent with

the sober house and the home will not admit persons who pose a
direct threat to the health or safety of others such as persons on the
7.2 ZONING 7.2
375:65
sex offender registry or prison pre-parolee;
8. A blank copy of every form that residents and potential residents are
required to complete; and

and may deny any transfer of a current registration or revoke a current
registration only under the following circumstances:
a. The owner or operator has provided materially false or misleading
information on its application or omitted any pertinent information.
b. Any owner or operator has an employment history in which he or she was
terminated during the prior five years, or any staff person has an
employment history in which he or she was terminated in the prior year,
due to physical assault, sexual harassment, embezzlement, theft,
falsifying a drug test, or selling or furnishing illegal drugs or alcohol.

parking impacts of the residence on the abutters.
7.2.4. Council review. Recognizing that this section necessarily implicates an
individual's rights of privacy and association, various competing interests of
residents in the community, and federal and state regulations that govern housing
and/or sober houses, the City Council shall annually, at its first meeting in March,
schedule a committee review of this section so as to ensure that it is both lawfully
and effectively achieving its purpose.

SECTION 8.0
Special Districts
8.1. Floodplain Overlay District (FPOD). [Amended 6-25-2012 by Order No.
2012-107]
8.1.1. Purpose. The purposes of the Floodplain Overlay District (FPOD) are:
1. To provide that the lands in the City subject to seasonal or periodic flooding
shall not be used for residence or other purposes in such a manner as to
endanger the health or safety of the occupants thereof.
2. To assure the continuation of the natural flow pattern of the watercourses
within the City in order to provide adequate and safe floodwater storage
capacity to protect persons and property against the hazards of flood
inundation.
8.1.2. The FPOD includes all flood hazard areas within the City of Quincy designated as
Zones A, AE, and VE on the Norfolk County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the
administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. The map panels of the
Norfolk County FIRM that are wholly or partially within the City of Quincy are
panel numbers 25021C0202E, 25021C0204E, 25021C0206E, 25021C0207E, and
25021C0208E dated July 17, 2012, and panel numbers 20521C0066F,

25021C0089F, 25021C0226F, and 25021C0227F dated June 9, 2014. The exact
boundaries of the district may be defined by the one-hundred-year base flood
elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Norfolk County Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) report dated June 9, 2014. The FIRM and FIS report are
incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the City Clerk, Planning
Board, and the Director of Inspectional Services. [Amended 6-3-2014 by Order
No. 2014-103]
8.1.3. Overlay district. The FPOD shall be considered as overlying other districts. Any
uses permitted in the portions of the districts so overlayed shall be permitted subject
to all the provisions of this Section 8.1. Where the provisions of the FPOD are more
stringent or otherwise adjust the requirements of the underlying district, the FPOD
shall govern.
8.1.4. Use regulations. In the FPOD, the following regulations shall apply:
1. No new building or structure shall be erected, constructed, altered, enlarged or
moved and no dumping, filling or earth transfer or relocation shall be
permitted unless in conformance with Section 8.1.7.
2. The following activities shall be permitted:
a. Conservation of soil, water, plants and wildlife.
b. Recreation, including play and sporting areas, education and nature study,
golf, skating, boating, swimming and fishing, where otherwise legally

purposes.
e. Dwellings lawfully existing prior to the adoption of these provisions may
be enlarged in area up to 25% of ground coverage.
8.1.5. Coastal high-hazard areas. In the FPOD, some areas are designated as coastal highhazard
areas (Zone VE). Since these areas are extremely hazardous due to highvelocity
waters from tidal surges and hurricane wash, all new construction shall be
located landward of the reach of the mean high tide. Man-made alteration of sand
dunes within Zone VE which would increase potential flood damage is prohibited.

constructed below the base flood level. Variances may also be issued for a
structure listed on a national register of historic places or a state inventory of
historic places that is to be restored or reconstructed.
3. If a variance is granted, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall notify the applicant
in writing over its signature that the issuance of such variance to construct
below the one-hundred-year base flood elevation will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of
insurance coverage and such construction below the one-hundred-year base
flood elevation increases risks to life and property.
4. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall maintain a record of all variance actions,
including justifications for issuance, and report such variances in the annual
report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration.
5. Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or other
developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, within
unnumbered A Zones.
6. Within Zone AO on the FIRM, adequate drainage paths must be provided
around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from

8.3.8. Special permit and site plan approval criteria. The Planning Board shall not
approve a special permit or site plan unless it finds that all of the following
additional criteria are met:
1. The Planning Board has adopted the Quincy Center District Design
Guidelines, dated November 2005, and the Quincy Center Districts Urban
Revitalization and Redevelopment Plan, dated May 7, 2007, both as may be
amended, for use in implementing this subsection. Those guidelines shall be
provided to every permit applicant, who shall be required to show compliance
with these guidelines as part of its application. The Planning Board shall
include as a part of any permit decision a statement addressing compliance
issues with these guidelines.
2. For mixed-use projects, the applicant must establish that the proposed uses are
to be located within structure(s) in a manner that promotes ease of use and
access and consistency with the surrounding uses/architecture; e.g., retail uses
should front onto a street and new housing shall be consistent with any
adjacent existing residential use in terms of density, style of architecture, etc.
3. Any development should be pedestrian friendly, as the Quincy Center Districts
will have limited vehicular access, and should be consonant with the
development goals for the district. Indicators of compliance with this criterion
include:
a. Ground floors, particularly where they face public streets, public parks,
and publicly accessible pathways, consist of spaces that are actively
inhabited by people, such as retail stores, consumer service businesses
and restaurants, general office, educational or residential uses. Where a
mix of activities is accommodated in a building, the more active uses are
encouraged facing public streets, parks and pathways.
b. Covered parking on the lower floors of a building and on-grade open
parking shall be discouraged where the parking faces a public street,
public park, or publicly accessible pathways.
c. Ground floors should be generally 25% to 50% transparent. The greatest
amounts of glass would be expected for retail uses with lesser amounts
for office, institutional or residential use.
d. Entries to buildings shall be located so as to ensure safe pedestrian
movement across streets, encourage walking as a preferred mode of travel
within the City and to encourage the use of public transit for employment
and other trips. Relating building entries as directly as possible to
crosswalks and to pathways that lead to bus stops and transit stations is
encouraged; buildings shall be located and developed to encourage
pedestrian pathways over the lot and through the districts.
4. Where appropriate, housing shall be a component of any large commercial
8.3 ZONING 8.3
375:77
development.
5. The common areas, both internal and external, shall, where appropriate, be
accessible to the pedestrian public. Restrictions on this access can be
established by the applicant or its successor in interest.
6. The location, dimensional and aesthetic features of the proposed development
shall not be detrimental to the architectural character of the downtown, to the
improvement of traffic access and circulation, and to the creation of active
pedestrian and street life within the districts.
7. There will be no nuisance or serious hazard to vehicles or pedestrians.
8. Adequate and appropriate facilities (including but not limited to parking and
loading) will be provided for the proper operation of the proposed use. Said
facilities shall be located and designed so as to be compatible with neighboring
developments.
9. Historical buildings and places within the Quincy historical district are to be
respected and protected. Special consideration shall be given to the
preservation of historical buildings and places within the Quincy Center
Districts.
8.3.9. Public Art and Place-Making Program. It is the purpose of this subsection to lessen
the visual impact of development and to create a Public Art and Place-Making
Program for new development and redevelopment in the Quincy Urban
Redevelopment District and the Quincy Center Zoning Districts on plots greater
than 1/4 acre. The Public Art and Place-Making Program, through the requirements
of this subsection, shall further the commitment of the City of Quincy to the

as the "Public Art Commission." The Public Art Commission shall consist of five
members plus an additional two alternates and one nonvoting high school student,
all of whom shall be appointed by the Mayor. A quorum shall consist of three
voting members. The Public Art Commission members shall be nominated as
follows:

3 nominations by the Mayor
1 nomination by the Planning Board
2 alternates nominated by the Mayor
1 nonvoting student nominated by the Mayor

excess of $20,000.
4. Establishing an annual administrative budget for the Commission.
5. Establishing an annual calendar which shall include not fewer than six open
public meetings of the Commission.
8.3.12. On-site and off-site contributions. All development, redevelopment, remodeling
or converting greater than 20,000 square feet in gross floor area which is in
nonresidential districts, or within mixed-use or multifamily districts on plots greater
than 1/4 acre within the Quincy Urban Redevelopment District of the Quincy
Center Zoning Districts, shall participate in the Public Art and Place-Making
Program. When construction is phased, the aggregate gross square footage of the
entire project or development shall be added together to determine whether the
twenty-thousand-square-foot threshold is reached. Owners have the three choices
for participating in the Public Art and Place-Making Program as follows:
1. Off-site option. The owner of a development or redevelopment may pay as
mitigation 1% of the development hard costs, exclusive of land acquisition
expenses, to the Commission's Public Art Fund prior to the issuance of a
building permit;
2. On-site option. The owner of a development or redevelopment project may
provide artwork located at the development site equal to or greater than 1% of
the development hard costs, exclusive of land acquisition expenses, for the
project; or
3. The owner of the development and the Public Art Commission may agree to
allocate part of the funding to pay for on-site art and place the remainder of the
contribution into the off-site Public Art Fund.
8.3.13. Public Art Fund. There is hereby created a Public Art Fund administered by the
Public Art Commission which shall consist of all contributions received from
projects as defined under Section 8.3.12. The Public Art Fund shall also include
cash grants and donations to the City for public art and place-making projects from
governmental or private resources and all other funds allocated by the City through
DIF funding or any budgetary process for the provision of public art. The Public
Art Fund shall be used solely for the Commission's administrative budget and
expenses associated with the selection, commissioning, acquisition, transportation,
maintenance, public education, promotion, administration, removal and insurance
of the works of art or in relation thereto.
8.3.14. Public Art and Place-Making Program Guidelines. The Public Art Commission
shall prepare, and from time to time revise, Public Art and Place-Making Program
Guidelines, as part of the Quincy Center District Design Guidelines, which shall
provide guidance for program organization; organizational governance and staffing
responsibilities; procedures for project planning; artist selection; art selection

375:83
2. Transit-oriented districts shall be overlay districts on the Zoning Map and, for
any land within a transit-oriented district, a developer may choose to conform
either to all the controls which govern the underlying zoning district or to the
transit-oriented district, and if electing the transit-oriented district, such
development shall be subject to the development controls and processes set
forth in this Section 8.5.
3. The following transit-oriented district overlay districts provided for by this
Section 8.5 and shown on the maps attached to and adopted with this Section
8.5 are hereby established: at the North Quincy Station of the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).
4. This Section 8.5 does not establish a transit-oriented district at the Quincy
Center Station, Wollaston Station or Quincy Adams Station of the MBTA.
8.5.2. Uses. Within transit-oriented districts, buildings and premises may be used for
TOD permitted uses subject to compliance with the requirements of Section 8.5.3.
TOD prohibited uses shall be prohibited in transit-oriented districts. Any other use
may be permitted in a transit-oriented district with a special permit from the
Planning Board pursuant to Section 8.5.6.
8.5.3. Dimensional requirements. Within transit-oriented districts, the following
dimensional requirements shall apply:
1. Minimum lot size: one acre.
2. Minimum lot area per dwelling unit: 325 square feet.
3. Maximum number of stories: eight.
4. A development parcel may consist of multiple legal parcels which may be
owned by different parties and which are not required to be contiguous.
5. There shall be no minimum or maximum dimensional requirements in transitoriented
districts other than as set forth in this Section 8.5.3. Upon the issuance
of a certification of consistency for a proposed development in a transitoriented
district, the dimensions reflected on the reviewed site plan shall be
deemed to be in compliance with this section.
6. The dimensional requirements in a transit-oriented district may be reduced or
modified as permitted by the Quincy Planning Board in accordance with its

new construction with a net increase in gross floor area of 10,000 square feet,
parking shall be provided at a ratio of one space for every 400 square feet.
7. Shared parking. Because of the proximity of an MBTA transit station in a
transit-oriented district, where a mix of uses is proposed within a development
parcel and where the uses in question have peak user demands at different
times, up to 50% of the required amount of minimum parking set forth in this
Section 8.5.4 may be provided via a shared parking arrangement.
8.5.5. Consistency review. All development and redevelopment of all uses and all
structures within transit-oriented districts (if the owner or developer of the proposed
development or redevelopment has elected to permit such development or
redevelopment in a transit-oriented district and Sections 8.5.1 through 8.5.4 rather
than the underlying zoning district) shall require a determination by the Quincy
Planning Board of consistency with this Section 8.5. Development or
redevelopment in a transit-oriented district is exempt from the requirements of
Section 8.1 of this chapter regarding development in the Floodplain Overlay
District, including any requirement for a special permit; the treatment of impacts on
the floodplain shall instead be taken into consideration by the Planning Board
during its consistency review of the applicable transit-oriented district
development.
8.5.6. Special permit granting authority. Where the following is otherwise required for a
development in a transit-oriented district (which development or redevelopment is
being permitted pursuant to the transit-oriented overlay district and Sections 8.5.1
through 8.5.4), the Quincy Planning Board is hereby designated as the special
permit granting authority for such matters within transit-oriented districts:
1. All applications seeking a finding pursuant to MGL c. 40A, § 6; and

8.5.7. Special permit and consistency review criteria. The Planning Board shall not
approve a special permit or make a determination of consistency for a project in a
transit-oriented district proceeding under a transit-oriented district and this Section
8.5 unless it finds that all of the following criteria have been met:
1. The project conforms with the TOD design guidelines.
2. For mixed-use projects, the applicant must establish that the proposed uses are
to be located within structure(s) in a manner that promotes ease of use and
access.
3. Where appropriate, housing shall be a component of any large-scale
commercial development.
4. Where appropriate, the common areas of the development, both internal and
external, shall be accessible to the public. Reasonable restrictions on public
8.5 ZONING 8.5
375:85
access as appropriate can be established by the applicant or its successor in
interest. This concept shall not apply to common areas exclusively serving the
residents of residential developments.
5. The location of buildings and features, dimensions of the site and the
development, traffic impacts and aesthetic features of the proposed
development shall not be detrimental to vehicular access and circulation within
the site and the area leading to and surrounding the development parcel.
6. There will be no nuisance or serious hazard to vehicles or pedestrians.
7. Adequate and appropriate facilities (including but not limited to trash, snow
storage or removal, parking and loading) will be provided for the proper
