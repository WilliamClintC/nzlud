DELANO, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Delano, California 
____________ 
Date of Republication: 2011 

PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Delano, California. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, Chapter, and Section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an Ordinance Disposition Table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with the republication, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2018-1298, passed February 20, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the City as accessible as possible to City officials, City employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. No. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    This table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    This table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List 
    Beginning with the republication, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Bennett, Editor, and Eric Grant, Vice President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Phyllis Kraft, City Clerk, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Municipal Code which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. 
Instruction Sheet 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. When new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use.

Chapter 1.08 - CODE ENFORCEMENT 
Sections: 
I. - IN GENERAL 

1.08.010 - Declaration of purpose. 
    The council finds that the enforcement of the Municipal Code and applicable state codes throughout the city is an important public service. Code enforcement is vital to protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. The council recognizes that enforcement starts with the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in administrative enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. The council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system that uses a combination of judicial and administrative remedies is critical to gain compliance with code regulations. Failure to comply with an administrative code enforcement action may require the city attorney to file a judicial action to gain compliance.

A.  The name of the property's record owner; 
B.  Street address; 
C.  The code sections in violation;

These may include the taking of photographs, samples or other physical evidence. All inspections, entries, examinations and surveys shall be done in a reasonable manner and in accordance with laws and regulations related to same. If an owner, occupant or agent refuses permission to enter or inspect, the code enforcement official may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to the procedures provided for in California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1822.5 through 1822.59.

2.52.010 - Introduction. 
A.  Effective June 1, 1967, the City of Delano established this City of Delano Employee Pension Plan for the benefit of its eligible employees. Since then, the City has amended the Plan on various occasions. 
B.  Effective July 1, 2010, the City Council again hereby restates the Plan as set forth below, in order to conform its terms to the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to make certain other revisions intended to clarify the intended operation of the Plan. 
C.  This Plan restatement will not reduce any Participant's accrued benefits under the Plan. The restatement will apply only to Participants who are Eligible Employees anytime on or after July 1, 2010. Benefits under the Plan for any Participant who retired or terminated before that date will be determined in accordance with the Plan provisions that were in effect on the Participant's date of retirement or termination of employment. 
D.  The purpose of the Plan is to provide benefits to the City's eligible employees upon retirement, prior death, or disability. The Plan generally covers full-time, regular employees of the City, except excluded public safety officers. Effective June 25, 2005, unless they elected otherwise, all public safety officers then employed by the City ceased to participate in the Plan and became covered by the City under the CalPERS retirement program. In addition, all public safety officers hired on or after that date are covered under CalPERS, not under this Plan. Accordingly, the only public safety officers covered by this Plan are those who terminated City employment with a vested interest under this Plan before June 25, 2005, and those who were employed on that date but who elected to remain covered by this Plan instead of transferring to CalPERS. 
E.  This Plan is intended to meet the applicable requirements to be a qualified tax-exempt retirement plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
F.  The Plan is funded by both City and Employee contributions. All amounts contributed to the Plan, and all earnings on those amounts, are held in Trust for the benefit of Participants. All amounts distributed under the Plan are paid from the Trust. 
G.  The Trust was established under the terms of a trust agreement, which is hereby incorporated into, and made a part of the Plan. 
H.  Unless otherwise specified, capitalized terms are defined in Section 2.52.020. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1221, § 1(Exh. 1), 2-7-2011) 
2.52.020 - Definitions. 
    "Account" means the account established under the Plan for each Participant in order to record the Participant's contributions made to the Plan pursuant to Subsection 2.52.040.B (including any required Participant contributions paid by the Employer in accordance with Subsection 2.52.040.B.4). The Account balance will be credited with interest at six percent per annum, compounded annually. 
    "Actuarial Equivalent" means the equivalent of a given benefit under the Plan, or a given amount payable in another manner or by other means, determined conclusively by or under the direction of the Committee in accordance with actuarial principles, methods and assumptions which are found to be appropriate by the Plan's Actuary (and which may differ from those used for the purpose of Subsection 2.52.040.A). Such assumptions will include: (1) an interest rate of eight percent compounded annually; (2) the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table with separate mortality tables for men and women related to credited service prior to July 1, 1983; and (3) the unisex table for credited service after July 1, 1983, which is the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table for male lives with ages set back two years. 
    "Actuary" means an actuary who has been enrolled by the Joint Board for the enrollment of Actuaries and who has been employed or engaged to recommend the actuarial cost method to be used in determining the Plan's liabilities to make actuarial valuations of the liabilities under the Plan, to recommend the amount of contributions to be made, and to perform such other services deemed necessary or advisable in connection with the administration of the Plan. 
    "Alternate Payee" means a Spouse, former Spouse, Domestic Partner, former Domestic Partner, child or dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the Plan with respect to the Participant.

In the case of a disability benefit, the first day of the first period for which a benefit is to be received by reason of disability shall be treated as the Annuity Starting Date only if such benefit is not an auxiliary benefit. 
    "Beneficiary" means the person or persons designated by the Participant, at the time and in the manner specified by the Committee, to receive the Participant's benefits under the Plan upon his or her death. The Participant has the right to change or revoke such designation from time to time by filing a new designation or notice of revocation with the Committee. If the Participant has a Spouse or Domestic Partner, the Participant's designation of a Beneficiary other than the Spouse or Domestic Partner will be valid only with the written consent of the Spouse or Domestic Partner; such consent must be filed at the time and in the manner specified by the Committee. If a Participant marries or enters into a registered domestic partnership, the Participant's prior designation of a Beneficiary other than the Spouse or Domestic Partner will automatically terminate. If upon his or her death, the Participant does not have a valid Beneficiary designation on file, or if the no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant, the Beneficiary will be the Participant's surviving Spouse or Domestic Partner; if there is no surviving Spouse or Domestic Partner, the Participant's benefits will be paid to his or her estate. 
    "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and any successor statute thereto, and any regulations promulgated thereunder. 
    "Committee" means a committee of five members including two elected by General Participants, and three appointed by the Mayor of the City of Delano, with approval of the City Council in accordance with Section 2.52.080. 
    "Compensation" means straight time basic wages or salaries paid to an Eligible Employee by the Employer for personal services rendered, including any "elective deferrals" (within the meaning of Section 402(g)(3) of the Code) withheld from the Employee's gross income by the Employer that are not includible in the Employee's gross income by reason of Sections 125, 132(f)(4) or 457(b) of the Code, but excluding bonuses, commissions, overtime pay, bilingual pay, educational pay, incentive pay, longevity pay, expense reimbursements, and employer contributions to, and benefits from, benefit plans sponsored by the Employer. 
    For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and before January 1, 1996, in no event may a Participant's annual Compensation exceed two hundred thousand dollars, as adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as section 415(d) of the Code. 
    For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 1996, and before January 1, 2002, the annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account for determining all benefits provided under the Plan for any Plan Year must not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars, as adjusted for the cost-of-living increases in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. 
    For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the annual Compensation of each Participant taken into account in determining all benefits under the Plan for any Plan Year must not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. 
    In determining benefit accruals for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2001, the annual Compensation limit in this Section for determination periods beginning before January 1, 2002 is two hundred thousand dollars if a Participant has an Hour of Service on or after January 1, 2002. 
    The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual Compensation for the Plan Year that begins with or within such calendar year. 
    If a determination period consists of fewer than twelve months, the annual Compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual Compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve. 
    "Domestic Partner" means a person who has entered into a registered domestic partnership with a Participant or a former Participant in accordance with Division 2.5 of the California Family Code, as amended. 
    "Early Retirement Age" means age fifty-five for a General Participant or age fifty for a Safety Participant.

For purposes of making such determination, the Committee may require a Participant to submit to a medical examination and to such reexamination as the Committee may deem necessary, and such medical examination or reexamination may be made by such competent physician or physicians or clinic or hospital as the Committee may select, at no cost to the Participant. A Participant shall not be deemed disabled for the purposes of this Section if, on the basis of proof satisfactory to it, the Committee determines that the Participant's disability arose from any intentionally self-inflicted injury or injury resulting from participation in any criminal undertaking or from service in the armed forces of any country, or consists of chronic alcoholism or addiction to narcotics or drugs (or injury or disease resulting therefrom). The Plan does not provide a disability pension other than regular retirement benefits as described under Section 2.52.050.

    "Vested" means a Participant has a nonforfeitable interest to a retirement benefit under the Plan. A Participant's vested interest is determined under Subsection 2.52.050.D.2. A Participant is not Vested for purposes of the Plan unless and until he or she attains a nonforfeitable interest under Subsection 2.52.050.D.2. 
    "Year of Service" means each successive twelve-consecutive-month period beginning with a Participant's commencement or recommencement of employment with the Employer as an Eligible Employee and each anniversary of that date ("Anniversary Year") through which the Participant remains continuously employed as an Eligible Employee. For this purpose, only Years of Service on or after the Participant's eighteenth birthday will be credited. A Participant who completes fewer than twelve consecutive months of continuous employment as an Eligible Employee in an Anniversary Year will be credited with a partial Year of Service equal to the number of months of employment during the Anniversary Year during which the Participant is continuously employed as an Eligible Employee divided by twelve. For purposes of determining Years of Service, a Participant will be treated as being employed as an Eligible Employee during a leave of absence only to the extent provided in Subsection 2.52.030.E.

1.  The Participant's termination of employment with the Employer if, upon such termination, the Participant is not Vested in any retirement benefit under the Plan and the Participant's Account balance is zero; 
2.  The payment of the Participant's entire nonforfeitable interest under the Plan; or 
3.  The Participant's death. 
D.  Reemployment. A Participant whose employment with the Employer terminates will, upon his or her reemployment as an Eligible Employee, immediately resume active participation in the Plan. 
E.  Leaves of Absence. 
1.  A Participant who is on a leave of absence of not more than twelve months' duration, with or without pay, authorized in writing by the Employer or on a military leave of absence required by applicable Federal law to be credited to him for service in the Armed Forces shall be considered to be in employment as an Eligible Employee during such absence, but only if: 
a.  In the case of such an Employer-approved leave of absence, the Participant returns to work or retires under the Plan prior to or at the expiration of such leave of absence or any extension thereof; and 
b.  In the case of a military leave of absence, the Participant returns to work within ninety days (or such longer period as may be established by the laws of the United States for the retention of reemployment rights of veterans) following the Participant's discharge from the Armed Forces. For this purpose, "military leave" means any period of continuous service in the Armed Forces of the United States or any of its allies during a period of declared war or national emergency, or in the military service of the United States at any other time.

2.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with section 414(u) of the Code.

(Ord. No. 2011-1221, § 1(Exh. 1), 2-7-2011) 
2.52.040 - Contributions. 
A.  Funding. The cost of benefits under the Plan will be provided by the Employer in such amounts as the Employer in its sole discretion shall determine to be necessary to fund such benefits; provided, however, that the Employer shall contribute at least such amounts as are deemed necessary by an actuary to fund the benefits provided by the Plan on an actuarially sound basis. The Employer will pay its contributions directly to the Trust at the time required by California law 
B.  Participant Contributions. 
1.  Each Participant must contribute a percentage of his or her Compensation to the Plan. The contribution rates are subject to provision of certain union contracts and agreements. (The current rates are given in Appendix A.) Since the enrollment in the Plan by a Participant is mandatory, the Participant is not permitted to withdraw the Participant's contributions while the Participant is employed by the Employer. 
2.  All Participant contributions will be deducted from the Participants' Compensation by payroll deduction and will be paid by the Employer to the Plan on behalf of Participants. Contributions under this Section must be transmitted to the Trustee and credited to Participants' Accounts by the last business day of the month after the month in which the contribution is deducted. 
3.  Effective February 1, 2011, although designated as employee contributions, Participant contributions will be picked up by the Employer for tax purposes in accordance with Section 414(h)(2) of the Code and will be treated as pre-tax Employer contributions. Participants will not have the option of receiving the contributed amounts instead of having them paid by the Employer to the Plan. 
4.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Employer may pay all or any portion of the contributions required to be paid by a Participant under this Subsection B. (The portion of Participant contributions currently paid by the Employer is shown in Appendix A.) The payments will be accounted for under the Plan as Participant contributions and, as such, will be credited to the Participant's Accounts. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to limit the authority of Employer to periodically increase, reduce, or eliminate the payment by the Employer of all or a portion of the contributions required to be paid by Participants. 
C.  Application of Forfeitures. Forfeitures will not be applied to increase the benefits any Participant would otherwise receive under the Plan, but will be applied to pay the Plan's reasonable expenses, reduce the Employer's contributions for normal costs in the current year or allocated to a reserve to reduce normal costs, or reduce unfunded past service liability, if any. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1221, § 1(Exh. 1), 2-7-2011) 
2.52.050 - Retirement benefits. 
A.  Normal Retirement Benefit. 
1.  To receive retirement benefits under the Plan, a Participant must retire and apply for retirement benefits at the time and in the manner specified by the Committee. Only Participants who are Vested are entitled to retirement benefits under the Plan. In addition, retirement benefits will be paid only after the Participant's employment with the Employer has terminated. A Vested Participant may elect to retire effective upon his or her Early Retirement Date, his or her Normal Retirement Date, or the first day of any month after the Participant's Normal Retirement Date, but in no event later than the latest date permitted under Appendix B. For all purposes under the Plan, "retire," "retires," "retirement," or other any derivation of "retire," refers to the Participant's receipt, after termination of his or her employment with the Employer, of a normal retirement benefit, early retirement benefit, or late retirement benefit under Subsections A., B. or C. of this section, respectively. As described in Subsection E. of this section, a Participant may receive, after termination of his or her employment with the Employer, a distribution of his or her Account without actually retiring under the Plan or without being eligible to retire. 
2.  A Participant who retires on his or her Normal Retirement Date is entitled to receive a monthly "normal retirement benefit" equal to: (2.0 pecent times first eight hundred thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents of Final Average Compensation plus 2.4 percent times Final Average Compensation in excess of eight hundred thirty-three dollars and thirty-three cents) multiplied by the number of Years of Service completed by the Participant. 
3.  The normal retirement benefit will be payable to the Participant in the form of a life annuity with period certain of sixty months. Under this normal form of benefit, if the Participant dies before sixty monthly payments have been paid, the monthly payments continue to the Participant's Beneficiary until the balance of the sixty monthly payments have been paid. In lieu of this form of benefit, the Participant may elect one of the Actuarially Equivalent optional forms of benefit described in Subsection G. below. 
B.  Early Retirement Benefit. 
1.  A Participant who retires on his or her Early Retirement Date is entitled to receive a monthly "early retirement benefit" equal to the Participant's normal retirement benefit (as calculated according to Subsection A.2 of this section, reduced to an Actuarially Equivalent amount to reflect the Participant's age as of the Early Retirement Date. 
2.  The early retirement benefit will be payable to the Participant in the normal form of benefit described in Subsection A.3 of this section. In lieu of that form, the Participant may elect one of the Actuarially Equivalent optional forms of benefit described in Subsection G of this section. 
C.  Late Retirement Benefit. 
1.  A Participant who retires after his or her Normal Retirement Date will be entitled to receive a monthly "late retirement benefit" equal to the Participant's monthly normal retirement benefit (as calculated according to Subsection A.2. above, payable as of the Participant's Normal Retirement Date, plus, for each full or partial Plan Year from the Participant's Normal Retirement Date to the Participant's actual retirement date, the greater of subsections a. or b. as follows: 
a.  Benefit Accrual. The change in the Participant's normal retirement benefit for the full or partial Plan Year, taking into account the Participant's additional Compensation and Years of Service credited to the Participant during the full or partial Plan Year. 
b.  Actuarial Increase. The amount under this subsection will be zero dollars on or before the Participant's Normal Retirement Date. For full and partial Plan Years after the Normal Retirement Date, the amount under this subsection will be the actuarial increase (determined using the factors for Actuarial Equivalent) in the amount determined under this subsection as of the end of the prior full or partial Plan Year to the end of the current full or partial Plan Year. This subsection will apply only to periods preceding commencement of benefits to the Participant from the Plan. 
2.  The late retirement benefit will be payable to the Participant in the normal form of benefit described in Subsection A.3 of this section. In lieu of that form, the Participant may elect one of the Actuarially Equivalent optional forms of benefit described in Subsection G. of this section. 
D.  Vesting. 
1.  Nonforfeitable Interest in Account. A Participant's Account balance, including amounts attributable to Employer-paid Participant contributions described in Subsection 2.52.040.B.4, is nonforfeitable at all times, and will not at any time be subject to the vesting schedule under Subsection D.2, below or any other vesting requirements. 
2.  Vesting schedule. 
a.  A Participant's Vested interest under the Plan is determined based on the Participant's Years of Service as follows: 
Number of Completed Years of Service Vested Percentage Less than 3 None 3 20 4 40 5 60 6 80 7 or more 100  
b.  A Participant becomes one hundred percent Vested under the Plan upon termination of employment with the Employer on or after the Participant's Normal Retirement Age. For this purpose, Normal Retirement Age for a General Participant hired by the Employer on or after January 1, 2011, means the later of: (i) attainment of age sixty; or (ii) the completion of seven Years of Service. 
3.  Reemployment. 
a.  If a Participant's employment with the Employer terminates before the Participant is Vested, the Participant's retirement benefits under the Plan shall be forfeited and cancelled. If the Participant is subsequently reemployed and resumes participation in the Plan in accordance with Subsection 2.52.030.D, the Participant's Years of Service before the break in service will be considered for purposes of determining the Participant's Vested interest and retirement benefit under the Plan, but only if the Participant had fewer than five consecutive One-Year Breaks in Service before the reemployment date. In addition, the extent to which such prior Years of Service are counted is subject to Subsection E.3, below. 
b.  If a Participant is Vested when his or her employment with the Employer terminates, and the Participant is subsequently reemployed and resumes participation in the Plan in accordance with Subsection 2.52.030.D, the Participant's Years of Service before the break in service will be considered for purposes of determining the Participant's Vested interest and retirement benefit under the Plan; however, the extent to which such prior Years of Service are counted is subject to Subsection E.3, below. 
E.  Termination Before Retirement. 
1.  If a Vested Participant's employment with the Employer terminates for any reason other than death or retirement, the Participant may elect to receive all or any portion of his or her Account balance. In addition, the Participant will subsequently be eligible to retire under the Plan and receive a retirement benefit on or after the Participant's Early Retirement Date. Such retirement benefit will be equal in value to the excess of (1) the actuarial value of the Accrued Benefit related to future service credits multiplied by vesting percentage, over (2) the amount distributed to the Participant from his or her Account. "Accrued Benefit" means (1) a Participant's projected normal retirement benefit described in Section 4.01 (as adjusted using the Actuarial Equivalent factors if the retirement date is before or after the Normal Retirement Age), without projection for future salary increases, multiplied by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years and fractions thereof of participation in the Plan as of the date the determination is being made, and the denominator of which is the number of years and fractions thereof of participation the Participant would have had if the Participant had remained in service until the Participant's retirement date. 
2.  If a non-Vested Participant's employment with the Employer terminates for reasons other than death or retirement, the Participant may elect to receive a lump-sum distribution of the Participant's Account balance. 
3.  This Subsection applies to any Participant who receives one or more distributions of any portion of his or her Account after termination of employment with the Employer, and who is subsequently rehired by the Employer and recommences active participation under Subsection 2.52.030.D within five years after the termination date. Such Participant will receive credit for all Years of Service before the break, but only if the Participant repurchases such service by redepositing in the Trust an amount equal to the Participant's total Account distributions, plus interest of six percent per annum, compounded annually. If the Participant does not redeposit that amount in the time and manner required by the Committee, he or she will not receive credit for Years of Service attributable to those distributions. Payment of the redeposit must be made in lump sum, at the time and in the manner determined by the Committee. In addition, the redeposit will be made either: (1) on an after-tax basis; (2) by direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution from an eligible retirement plan described in sections 401(a), 403(b), 408(a) and 457(b) of the Code; or (3) by transfer from the Employer's "eligible deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Code. 
F.  Disability Benefit. A Participant who terminates employment with the Employer due to a Total and Permanent Disability is entitled to the same benefits described in Subsection E. above, that the Participant would be entitled to if the Participant had terminated employment for reasons other than death, disability or retirement. 
G.  Optional Forms of Payment. In lieu of the normal form of payment, a Participant may elect in writing at the time and in the manner specified by the Committee, to receive the Participant's retirement benefit under Subsections A., B. or C. above, as applicable, in the form of one of the following Actuarially Equivalent optional forms of payment: 
1.  Straight Life Annuity. A monthly retirement benefit payable for the Participant's lifetime only with no payments to any person after the Participant's death. 
2.  Joint and Survivor Annuity. An actuarially reduced monthly retirement benefit payable for the Participant's lifetime with the provision that after the Participant's death a monthly benefit equal to a specified percentage (one hundred percent, sixty-six and two-thirds percent, or fifty percent) of the reduced monthly benefit payable during the Participant's life shall be paid to the Participant's joint annuitant during for the joint annuitant's lifetime through the month in which the joint annuitant dies. 
3.  Social Security Level Income. An adjusted monthly life annuity payable commencing before the Participant's Social Security retirement age pursuant to which the adjusted monthly payment payable before Social Security retirement age is reduced after the commencement of the Social Security payments by the approximate amount of such Social Security payments so as to produce to the greatest extent possible level retirement income throughout the remainder of the Participant's life. 
H.  Time of Payment of Retirement Benefits. 
1.  The payment of benefits under the Plan to the Participant, or the Participant's Beneficiary shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the Plan Year in which: 
a.  The Participant attains Normal Retirement Age; 
b.  Occurs the tenth anniversary of the year in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan; or 
c.  The Participant terminates employment with the Employer. 
2.  The distributions to a Participant shall commence not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of: 
a.  The calendar year in which the Participant attains age seventy and one-half;; or 
b.  The calendar year in which the Participant retires. 
3.  Regardless of any Plan provision to the contrary, all distributions under the Plan will meet the requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) and Appendix B. relating to required minimum distributions. 
4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure by the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary to consent to an immediate distribution is deemed to be an election to defer the commencement of payment of any benefit sufficient to satisfy this Section. 
I.  Distribution of Small Amounts. 
1.  If upon termination of a Participant's employment with the Employer, the sum of the present value of a Participant's Vested benefits under the Plan and the Participant's Account balance is one thousand dollars or less, the Committee will direct that the entire amount be distributed to the Participant or Beneficiary in one lump sum, and the Participant's or Beneficiary's consent will not be required. Any such distribution will be made in lieu of the payment of a monthly benefit under the Plan. 
2.  If such present value exceeds one thousand dollars, distribution of the Participant's benefits may not be made without the Participant's or Beneficiary's consent. 
3.  Present value will be determined using the factors specified in the definition of Actuarial Equivalent. 
J.  Suspension of Benefits Upon Reemployment. 
1.  If a Participant is reemployed by the Employer as an Eligible Employee after payment of retirement benefits have commenced, the payment of retirement benefits will be suspended until the Participant subsequently terminates employment with the Employer. Upon subsequent termination, the benefits will be recalculated so that any additional Years of Service credited to the Participant during the reemployment period will be taken into account. 
2.  If the Participant is reemployed by the Employer as an Employee but not an Eligible Employee, payment of retirement benefits will be suspended, unless continued payment is permitted by the Code. 
3.  If payment of a Participant's benefits is suspended due to reemployment with the Employer, payments will recommence after the subsequent termination of the Participant's employment with the Employer (or earlier to the extent permitted by the Code). 
K.  Preretirement Survivor Benefit. 
1.  If a Vested Participant dies before retiring, his or her Beneficiary will be entitled to receive: 
a.  If the Participant dies before attaining Early Retirement Age, a monthly annuity for the Beneficiary's life commencing on the date the Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age that is Actuarially Equivalent to the Participant's Vested benefit at the Participant's death. In addition, the Beneficiary may elect to receive a partial or full distribution of the Participant's Account before the date the Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age, in which case any survivor benefit payable to the Beneficiary will be reduced in the same manner as described in Subsection E.1 of this section. 
b.  If the Participant dies on or after attaining Early Retirement Age, but before attaining Normal Retirement Age, a monthly annuity for the Beneficiary's life commencing on the Participant's death that is Actuarially Equivalent to the Participant's Vested benefit at the Participant's death. 
c.  If the Participant dies on or after attaining Normal Retirement Age, sixty monthly payments which are Actuarially Equivalent to the Participant's Vested benefit at the Participant's death. 
2.  The Participant's Beneficiary may elect in writing, at the time and in the manner specified by the Committee, to commence payments under this Subsection K., within a reasonable time after the Participant's death. 
3.  If a Participant who separates from service on or after Normal Retirement Date, thereafter dies before beginning to receive the Participant's retirement benefits, the distribution of the Participant's benefit shall be made to the Participant's Beneficiary in the same manner and form as described under Subsection A. of this section, as if the pension payments had commenced on the date of the Participant's death. 
4.  The benefits paid to a Participant who dies on or after the Participant's Normal Retirement Date while still in active service of the Employer, will be distributed to the Participant's Beneficiary in the same manner and form as provided in Subsection A. of this section, as if the Participant had retired on the date of the Participant's death. 
L.  Death Before Vesting. If a Participant dies before becoming Vested under the plan, his or her entire Account balance, if any, will be distributed to the Beneficiary in lump sum upon the Beneficiary's consent. 
M.  Cost-of-Living Benefit. Commencing July 1, 1985, and each July 1 thereafter, annual adjustments are made in the monthly benefit amount following the date of retirement for Participants and their Beneficiaries, excluding existing retirees and their Beneficiaries as of July 1, 1985. The annual adjustment is an increase of two percent of the monthly benefit amount that was payable in the preceding month of June. 
N.  Eligible Rollover Distributions. If payment under the Plan is ever permitted in a form which qualifies as an Eligible Rollover Distribution, the Distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Committee, to have any portion of such Eligible Rollover Distribution rolled directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover. For purposes of this Subsection N., the following terms have the following meanings: 
1.  "Direct Rollover" means a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee. 
2.  "Distributee" means a Participant, a Participant's surviving Spouse, or a Participant's Spouse or former Spouse who is the Alternate Payee under a domestic relations order which is treated as a qualified domestic relations order to the extent provided in section 414(p)(11) of the Code, and such other persons as come within the meaning of the term as used in section 401(a)(31)(A) of the Code. Effective for Plan Years beginning on or after July 1, 2010, a Distributee also includes the Participant's non-Spouse Beneficiary. In the case of a non-Spouse Beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code ("IRA") that is established on behalf of the designated Beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code. Also, in this case, the determination of any required minimum distribution under section 401(a)(9) of the Code that is ineligible for rollover will be made in accordance with Notice 2007-7, Q&A-17 and 18, 2007-5 I.R.B. 395 (or its successor). 
3.  "Eligible Rollover Distribution" means a distribution from the Plan which constitutes an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, i.e., any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include: 
a.  Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made: (i) for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated Beneficiary; or (ii) for a specified period of ten years or more; 
b.  Any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; or 
c.  The portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income; provided, however, that this paragraph does not apply to the distribution if the plan to which the distribution is transferred: 
(A)  Is an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the Code; 
(B)  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2007, is a qualified trust which is part of a defined contribution plan that agrees to separately account for the amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible; or 
(C)  For taxable years beginning on or after December 31, 2006, is a qualified trust or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code, if such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (including interest thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
4.  "Eligible Retirement Plan" means a plan which constitutes an eligible retirement plan within the meaning of section 401(a)(31)(E) of the Code, including an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code that is a defined contribution plan, the terms of which permit the acceptance of rollover distributions. In the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a surviving Spouse or a surviving former Spouse, an Eligible Retirement Plan means only an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity. Effective for distributions after December 31, 2001, the definition of Eligible Retirement Plan applies without regard to the preceding sentence in the case of a distribution to a surviving Spouse, or to a Spouse or former Spouse who is the Alternate Payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in section 414(p) of the Code. Effective for distributions after December 31, 2001, the term "Eligible Retirement Plan" also includes an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this Plan. Effective for distributions after December 31, 2007, an Eligible Retirement Plan also includes a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the Code.

A.  Effective Date. The limitations of this Section apply in Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein. 
B.  Annual Additions Limit. The total Annual Additions allocated to a Participant's Account under the Plan, when added to the Annual Additions allocated to the Participant's accounts under all other qualified defined contribution plans maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate for any Limitation Year, must not exceed the lesser of: 
1.  Forty thousand dollars, as adjusted for increases in the cost-of-living under section 415(d) of the Code; or 
2.  One hundred percent of the Participant's Total Compensation for the Limitation Year. 
C.  Annual Benefit Limit. Unless the alternative limitation of Subsection G. of this section applies, effective for Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, the Annual Benefit payable to a Participant under the Plan at any time must not exceed one hundred sixty thousand dollars, adjusted as described in this Subsection C. (the "Annual Benefit Limit"). 
D.  Cost-of-living Limitation Adjustment. The Annual Benefit Limit is automatically adjusted under section 415(d) of the Code, effective January 1 of the calendar year for which the adjustment is determined by the Treasury Department. Any adjustment to the Annual Benefit Limit will be effective for Limitation Years ending with or within the calendar year with respect to which the adjustment is made, but a Participant's benefits may not reflect the adjustment prior to January 1 of that calendar year. The adjusted Annual Benefit Limit is applied at the time the Participant's benefits commence. 
E.  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. If the Participant is, or ever has been, a Participant in another qualified defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate, the sum of the Participant's Annual Benefits from all such defined benefit plans must not exceed the Annual Benefit Limit. Where the Participant's employer-provided benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of the same age) would exceed the Annual Benefit Limit applicable at that age, benefits accrued under the Plan and all such other plans shall be reduced in proportion to the total benefits accrued under each such plan but only to the extent necessary to comply with the limits on benefits set forth in this Section. For purposes of this Section: 
1.  The termination of any plan shall be disregarded; and 
2.  The total benefits accrued under each plan for calculating the proportional reduction shall be determined without regard to the limits of this Section. 
F.  Participation in Other Defined Contribution Plans. If a Participant participates in another defined contribution plan of the Employer or of an Affiliate that is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan, contributions or allocations that would otherwise be made on behalf of the Participant to the other plan shall first be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding the limitations of this regulation. 
G.  Adjustment for Less Than ten Years of Participation. 
1.  General Rule. If the Participant has less than ten Years of Participation in the Plan, the Annual Benefit Limit shall be multiplied by a fraction: 
a.  The numerator of which is the number of Years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of Participation in the Plan, and 
b.  The denominator of which is ten. 
2.  Special Rule for Death and Disability Benefits. The reduction described in Subsection G.1. of this Section shall not apply to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits. 
H.  Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age sixty-two or After Age sixty-five. Effective for benefits commencing in Limitation Years ending after December 31, 2001, the Annual Benefit Limit is adjusted for benefit commencement before age sixty-two or after age sixty-five as follows: 
1.  Adjustment for Benefit Commencement Before Age sixty-two. If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is before the Participant attains age sixty-two, the Annual Benefit Limit is equal to: 
a.  If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is before July 1, 2007, the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of a deferred straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-two with an annual benefit equal to the Annual Benefit Limit (adjusted under Subsection E. of this section for years of participation less than ten, if required) and with actuarial equivalence determined using: 
(A)  The Applicable Mortality Table; and 
(B)  An interest rate that is not less than the greater of: 
(i)  Five percent; or 
(ii)  The interest rate specified in Section 2.52.020 of the Plan. 
b.  If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is on or after July 1, 2007, the lesser of: 
(A)  The amount determined under Subsection H.1.a. of this section; or 
(B)  The Annual Benefit Limit (adjusted under Subsection E. of this section for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-two, both determined without applying the limitations of this Section. 
2.  Adjustment for Benefit Commencement After Age sixty-five. If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is after the Participant attains age sixty-five, the Annual Benefit Limit is equal to: 
a.  If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is before July 1, 2007, the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date that is the actuarial equivalent of a straight life annuity commencing at age sixty-five with an annual benefit equal to the Annual Benefit Limit (adjusted under Subsection E. of this section for years of participation less than ten, if required) and with actuarial equivalence determined using: 
(A)  The Applicable Mortality Table; and 
(B)  An interest rate that is not greater than the lesser of: 
(i)  Five percent; or 
(ii)  The interest rate specified in Section 2.52.020 of the Plan. 
b.  If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is on or after July 1, 2007, the lesser of: 
(A)  The amount determined under Subsection H.2.a. of this section; or 
(B)  The Annual Benefit Limit (adjusted under Subsection E. of this section for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan commencing at age sixty-five, both determined without applying the limitations of this Article. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the Participant, computed disregarding the Participant's accruals after age sixty-five but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-five is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical Participant who is age sixty-five and has the same accrued benefit as the Participant. 
3.  No Mortality Adjustment Unless Benefit Forfeited at Death. No adjustment will be made to the Annual Benefit Limit to reflect the probability of the Participant's death between the Annuity Starting Date and age sixty-two or between age sixty-five and the Annuity Starting Date, unless the Participant's benefit is forfeited at death before the Annuity Starting Date. 
4.  Special Rule for Qualified Police or Firefighters. The adjustment described in Subsection H.1. of this Section shall not apply if the Participant's benefit is based on at least fifteen years as a full-time employee of any police or fire department or as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
5.  Special Rule for Death and Disability Benefits. The adjustment described in Subsection H.1. of this Section shall not apply to preretirement disability benefits or preretirement death benefits. 
I.  Benefits Not in Excess of ten thousand dollars. The benefit payable to a Participant is treated as not exceeding the Annual Benefit Limit if: 
1.  The retirement benefits payable for a Limitation Year under any form of benefit with respect to the Participant under this Plan and all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether the plan has been terminated) ever maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate do not exceed ten thousand dollars multiplied by a fraction: 
a.  The numerator of which is the Participant's number of Years (or part thereof, but not less than one year) of Service (not to exceed ten) with the Employer or an Affiliate; and 
b.  The denominator of which is ten. 
2.  The Participant has never participated in any in any qualified defined contribution plan ever maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate. 
J.  Correction of Excess Annual Additions. Any excess Annual Additions shall be corrected using the methods specified in section 6.06 and Appendix A.08 of Revenue Procedure 2008-50 or any subsequent guidance promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury describing the procedures for correcting excess Annual Additions under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System ("EPCRS") or its successor.

(I)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that is Actuarially Equivalent to the Participant's form of benefit, computed using the interest rate and the mortality table specified in Section 2.52.020 of the Plan for determining actuarial equivalence; 
(II)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant's form of benefit, computed using a 5.5 percent interest rate and the Applicable Mortality Table; or 
(III)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant's form of benefit, computed using the Applicable Interest Rate and the Applicable Mortality Table, divided by 1.05.

If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is in a Plan Year beginning in 2004 or 2005, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same Annuity Starting Date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant's form of benefit, computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: 
(I)  The interest rate and the mortality table specified in Section 2.52.020 of the Plan for determining Actuarial Equivalence; or 
(II)  A 5.5 percent interest rate and the Applicable Mortality Table. 
    If the Participant's Annuity Starting Date is after December 31, 2003, and before January 1, 2005, the application of this Section 5.11(c)(4)(B)(ii) shall not cause the amount payable under the Participant's form of benefit to be less than the benefit calculated under the Plan, taking into account the limitations of this Section had the amount been determined using the Applicable Interest Rate in effect as of the last day of the last Plan Year beginning before January 1, 2004. 
4.  "Applicable Interest Rate" means for distributions with Annuity Starting Dates before July 1, 2008, a rate of interest equal to the annual rate of interest on thirty-year Treasury securities for the third month preceding the stability period, which is the Plan Year containing the Annuity Starting Date and for which the Applicable Interest Rate must remain constant. Effective for distributions with Annuity Starting Dates on or after July 1, 2008, "Applicable Interest Rate" means the "applicable interest rate" defined in section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code determined as of the third month preceding the stability period, which is the Plan Year containing the Annuity Starting Date and for which the Applicable Interest Rate must remain constant. 
5.  "Applicable Mortality Table" means the mortality table used for purposes of adjusting any benefit or limitation under Section 415(b) of the Code as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service to be applicable at such time. Effective for distributions with Annuity Starting Dates on or after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2008, the "Applicable Mortality Table" is the table prescribed in Revenue Ruling 2001-62. Effective with respect to distributions with Annuity Starting Dates on or after January 1, 2008, the Applicable Mortality Table" is the table prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code as set forth in Revenue Ruling 2007-67 or subsequent guidance from the Internal Revenue Service. 
6.  "Severance From Employment" means the Participant ceases to be an employee of the Employer and all Affiliates. A Participant does not have a Severance From Employment if, in connection with a change of employment, the Participant's new employer maintains the Plan with respect to the Participant. 
7.  "Total Compensation" means all items of remuneration described in subsection a. below and excludes all items of remuneration described in Subsection b. below of this subsection. 
a.  Total Compensation includes all of the following items of remuneration for services: 
(A)  A Participant's wages, salaries, fees for professional services, and other amounts received (without regard to whether or not an amount is paid in cash) for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the Employer and any Affiliate to the extent that the amounts are includible in gross income (or to the extent that amounts would have been includible in gross income but for an election under Code section 125(a), 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b)). These amounts include, but are not limited to, bonuses, fringe benefits, and reimbursements, or other expense allowances under a nonaccountable plan, as described in section 1.62-2(c) of the Treasury regulations; 
(B)  Amounts described in section 104(a)(3), 105(a), or 105(h) of the Code, but only to the extent that these amounts are includible in the gross income of the Participant; 
(C)  Amounts paid or reimbursed by the Employer or an Affiliate for moving expenses incurred by a Participant, but only to the extent that at the time of the payment it is reasonable to believe that these amounts are not deductible by the Participant under section 217 of the Code; 
(D)  The amount includible in the gross income of a Participant upon making the election described in section 83(b) of the Code; 
(E)  Amounts that are includible in the gross income of a Participant under the rules of section 409A of the Code or section 457(f)(1)(A) of the Code, or because the amounts are constructively received by the Participant; and 
(F)  Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2008, differential wage payments (as defined in section 3401(h)(2) of the Code). 
b.  Total Compensation excludes each of the following items:

(B)  Other amounts that receive special tax benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance (but only to the extent that the premiums are excludible from the gross income of the Participant, and are not salary reduction amounts that are described in section 125 of the Code); 
(C)  Other items of remuneration that are similar to any of the items listed in Subsections (A) and (B), above. 
c.  Timing. 
(A)  In order to be taken into account for a Limitation Year, Total Compensation must be paid or made available (or, if earlier, includible in the gross income of the Participant) during the Limitation Year. For this purpose, compensation is treated as paid on a date if it is actually paid on that date or it would have been paid on that date but for an election under section 125, 132(f)(4), 401(k), 403(b), 408(k), 408(p)(2)(A)(i), or 457(b) of the Code. 
(B)  In order to be taken into account for a Limitation Year, Total Compensation must be paid or treated as paid to the Participant prior to the Participant's Severance From Employment with the Employer; provided, however, that Total Compensation includes amounts paid to the Participant by the later of two and one-half months after Severance From Employment or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the Severance From Employment date if the amounts are regular compensation for services during the Participant's regular working hours, compensation for services outside the Participant's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar compensation that absent a Severance From Employment would have been paid to the Participant while the Participant continued in employment with the Employer. 
(C)  Total Compensation does not include amounts paid after Severance From Employment that are severance pay, unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation, or any other payment that is not described in the preceding subsection, even if paid within two and one-half months, except for: 
(i)  Payments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (as defined in section 414(u) of the Code) to the extent that these payments do not exceed the amounts that the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service; and 
(ii)  Payments to a Participant who is permanently and totally disabled; provided, however that salary continuation applies to all Participants who are permanently and totally disabled for a fixed or determinable period. For this purpose, a Participant is permanently and totally disabled only if the Participant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted, or can be expected to last, for a continuous period of not less than twelve months. 
d.  Limit. A Participant's Total Compensation shall not include compensation in excess of the limitation of section 401(a)(17) of the Code that is in effect for the calendar year in which such Limitation Year begins. 
8.  "Year of Participation" means each accrual computation period for which the following conditions are met: 
a.  The Participant is credited with at least the number of Hours of Service or period of service for benefit accrual purposes, required under the terms of the Plan in order to accrue a benefit for the accrual computation period; and 
b.  The Participant is included as a Participant under the eligibility provisions of the Plan for at least one day of the accrual computation period. If these two conditions are met, the portion of a Year of Participation credited to the Participant shall equal the portion of a year of benefit accrual service credited to the Participant for such accrual computation period. 
    A Participant who is permanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Section 415(c)(3)(C)(i) of the Code for an accrual computation period shall receive a Year of Participation with respect to that period. In no event shall more than one Year of Participation be credited for any twelve-month period.

B.  Committee Action. 
1.  The Committee shall choose a Secretary, who need not be one of its members (hereinafter referred to as "Secretary") who shall keep minutes of its proceedings and all records and documents pertaining to its administration of the Plan. Any action of the Committee shall be taken pursuant to a majority vote, or to the written consent of a majority of its members and such action shall constitute the action of the Committee and be binding on the same as if all members had joined therein.

2.  A member of the Committee shall not vote or act upon any matter which relates solely to himself as a Participant. If a matter arises affecting one of the members of the Committee as a Participant and the other members of the Committee are unable to agree as to the disposition of such matter, the City Council shall appoint a substitute member to the Committee in the place and stead of the affected member, for the sole and only purpose of passing upon and deciding the particular matter.

6.  To maintain all necessary records for the administration of the Plan other than those maintained by the Trustee; 
7.  To make and publish such rules for the regulation of the Plan which are not inconsistent with the terms hereof; 
8.  To engage an actuary or actuaries to make calculations required in the operation of the Plan, and such other persons as it may deem proper to render legal, accounting and other services;

    All action of the Committee shall be conclusive on all persons interested in the Plan except to the extent otherwise specifically indicated herein. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have no responsibility or authority with regard to the investment, control, or management of Plan assets (other than as specified in Subsections 3., 4., and 5. above). Such responsibility and authority shall rest entirely with the Trustee or such investment manager as may be appointed to manage the investments of the Trust. 
D.  Delegation. The Committee may delegate any of its responsibilities under the Plan to any other person. Such delegation shall be accomplished by a written instrument executed by the Secretary of the Committee specifying the responsibilities delegated and the fiduciary responsibilities allocated to such delegate. The allocation of such responsibilities shall be effective upon the date specified in the delegation subject to written acceptance by the delegate. Any such delegation of responsibilities under this Section shall provide for reports, no less often than annually, by such delegate to the Committee of such information necessary to fully inform the Committee of the status and operation of the Plan and of the delegate's discharge of the responsibilities delegated. 
E.  Transmittal of Information. In order to enable the Committee to perform its functions under the Plan, the Employer shall supply full and timely information to the Committee or its authorized representative on all matters relating to the compensation of all Participants, their employment, retirement, death, or the cause for termination of employment and such other pertinent facts as may be required. 
F.  Duty of Care. In the exercise of its powers and duties under the Plan, the Committee shall act solely in the interest of the Participants and Beneficiaries of Plan and shall discharge its duties hereunder with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. 
G.  Compensation and Expenses. The members of the Committee who are not employed by the City shall be paid fifty dollars per meeting, not to exceed compensation for one meeting per month.

I.  Relationship of Fiduciaries. Each fiduciary of the Plan will be solely responsible for its own acts or omissions. Except to the extent imposed by applicable law, no fiduciary shall have the duty to question whether any other fiduciary is fulfilling any or all of the responsibilities imposed upon such other fiduciary. No fiduciary shall have any liability for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another fiduciary with respect to the Plan or Trust unless the fiduciary knowingly participates in such breach, knowingly undertakes to conceal such breach, has actual knowledge of such breach and fails to take reasonable remedial action to remedy said breach or, through the fiduciary's negligence in performing the fiduciary's own specific fiduciary responsibilities, has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach of the latter's fiduciary responsibilities. 
(Ord. No. 2011-1221, § 1(Exh. 1), 2-7-2011; Ord. No. 2016-1280, § 1(Exh. A), 2-1-2016) 
2.52.090 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.  Plan Continuance Not Employer Obligation. It is the expectation and intention of the Employer that this Plan will continue indefinitely, but the continuance of this Plan is not assumed as a contractual obligation by the Employer, and the right is reserved by the Employer, at any time to reduce, suspend or discontinue contributions to the Trust or terminate this Plan; provided, however, that no amendment, alteration, modification or termination of the Plan may adversely affect the accrued rights of any Participant without corresponding advantages. 
B.  Plan Termination Upon Dissolution. The Plan will terminate in the event: 
1.  The Employer is dissolved and liquidate;, or 
2.  The Employer is merged or consolidated with or transfers all or substantially all of the assets of the Employer to a successor or transfers to a successor all or substantially all of the assets of the Employer and such successor does not within one hundred eighty days elect to continue the Plan. 
C.  Effect of Plan Termination or Discontinuance of Contributions. In the event of a termination or a complete discontinuance of contributions to the Trust, the rights of all affected Participants to benefits then accrued, to the extent then funded, will thereupon become one hundred percent Vested and nonforfeitable, subject to the order of priority set forth below, and the Trustee will make a prompt determination of the fair market value of the Trust assets and it will then be applied so as to provide (to the extent not already provided) benefits in said order of priority. Benefits for each such person will be computed on the basis of credited service accrued up to the date of said termination or discontinuance. 
1.  Allocation of Assets. In the case of the termination of this Plan, the Committee will allocate the assets thereof (available to provide benefits) among the Participants and Beneficiaries of the Plan as follows: 
a.  First, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity: 
(A)  In the case of the benefit of a Participant or Beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the three-year period ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least; 
(B)  In the case of a Participant's or Beneficiary's benefit (other than a benefit described in subsection (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such three-year period if the Participant had retired prior to the beginning of the three-year period and if the Participant's benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the Plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least. For purposes of subsection (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a three-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period. 
b.  Second: 
(A)  To all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the Plan that would be guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA (determined without regard to Section 4022(b)(5) of said Act) if Title IV of ERISA applied to the Plan, and 
(B)  To the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subsectiob (A) without regard to Section 4022(b)(6) of ERISA. 
    For purposes of this subsection, Section 4021 of said Act shall be applied without regard to subsection (c) thereof. 
c.  Third, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the Plan. 
d.  Fourth, to all other benefits under the Plan. 
2.  Adjustments and Limitations. For purposes of subsection 1. above: 
a.  The amount allocated under any paragraph with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior subsection. 
b.  If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph (other than subsections C.1.c. and d., above) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that subsection, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subsection. 
c.  This subsection applies if the assets available for allocation under subsection 1.c., above are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that subsection. 
(A)  If this subsection applies, except as provided in subsection (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such subsection c. on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such subsection c. under the Plan as in effect at the beginning of the five-year period ending on the date of Plan termination. 
(B)  If the assets available for allocation under subsection (A), above are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subsection (without regard to this subsection), then for purposes of subsection (A) above, benefits of individuals described in such subsection shall be determined on the basis of the Plan as amended by the most recent Plan amendment effective during such five year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subsection (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subsection shall be allocated under subsection (A) on the basis of the Plan as amended by the next succeeding Plan amendment effective during such period. 
3.  Distribution of Residual Assets. Any residual assets of a Plan may be distributed to the Employer if: 
a.  All liabilities of the Plan to Participants and their Beneficiaries have been satisfied; and 
b.  The distribution does not contravene any provision of law. 
    Such allocation and provision for the retirement benefits shall be accomplished through either continuance of the Trust, the creation of a new trust, or the purchase of annuity contracts; provided, however, that the Committee upon finding that it is not practicable or desirable under the circumstances to do any of the foregoing with respect to one or more of the groups listed above, may provide some other means, including cash payments, but no change will be effected in the order or precedence and the basis of allocation established above. 
D.  Limitation on Rights of Participants. Nothing contained in the Plan shall give any Employee the right to be retained in the service of the Employer or to interfere with or restrict the right of the Employer, which is hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or retire any Employee or to change an Employee's rate of compensation at any time with or without cause. Inclusion under the Plan will not give any Participant any right or claim to a retirement income or any other benefit hereunder except to the extent such right has specifically become fixed under the terms of the Plan and there are funds available therefore in the hands of the Trustee. The doctrine of substantial performance shall have no application to Participants. Each condition and provision, including numerical items, has been carefully considered and constitutes the minimum limit on performance which will give rise to the applicable right. 
E.  Payment on Behalf of a Minor or Incompetent. In the event any amount becomes payable under the Plan to a minor or a person who, in the sole judgment of the Committee, is considered by reason of physical or mental condition to be unable to give a valid receipt therefor, the Committee may direct that such payment be made to any person found by the Committee, in its sole judgment to have assumed the care of such minor or incompetent. Such determination shall constitute a full release and discharge of the Trustee, the Committee, the Employer and its officers and Employees. 
F.  Amendments. The Employer shall have the right to amend this Plan from time to time to amend or cancel any such amendments. Such amendment shall be stated in an instrument in writing, executed by the Employer in the same manner as this Plan. Except as may be required to permit the Plan to meet the requirements for qualification and tax exemption under the Code, or any other applicable law, no amendment may be made which may: 
1.  Cause any of the assets of the Plan or Trust, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to Participants and their Beneficiaries, to be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries and for defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan; 
2.  Have any retroactive effect so as to deprive any Participant or Beneficiary of any benefit which the Participant would be entitled to under this Plan if the Participant's employment were terminated at the time of such amendment. 
G.  Alienation. None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant, or Beneficiary, shall be subject to any claim of any creditor and, in particular, the same shall not be subject to attachment or garnishment or other legal process by any creditor, nor shall any such Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or proceeds which the Participant may expect to receive, contingently or otherwise, under this Plan. 
H.  Errors and Misstatements. In the event of any misstatement, omission of fact or error resulting in payment of benefits in an incorrect amount, the Committee shall promptly cause the amount of future payments to be corrected upon discovery of the true facts, and shall cause the Trustee to pay the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary any underpayment, in a lump sum cash amount, or to recoup any overpayment from future payments to the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary in such amounts as the Committee shall direct, or to proceed against the Participant or the Participant's Beneficiary for recovery of any such overpayment. 
I.  Titles. Titles are provided herein for convenience only and are not to serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of this Plan. 
J.  Governing Law; Severability. This Plan and the Trust shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of California to the extent not preempted by applicable federal law; provided, however, that if any provision is susceptible to more than one interpretation, such interpretation shall be given thereto as is consistent with this Plan being a tax-qualified employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code. If any provision of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective. 
K.  Merger or Consolidation. This Plan shall not be merged or consolidated with, nor shall its assets or liabilities be transferred to any other plan unless each Participant in this Plan (if the Plan then terminated) would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit the Participant would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if this Plan had been terminated). Where the foregoing requirement is satisfied this Plan may be merged or consolidated with another qualified Plan. 
L.  Contributions not Recoverable. It shall be impossible for any part of the contributions made under this Plan to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan; provided, however, that notwithstanding this or any other provision of this Plan, contributions made by the Employer because of a good faith mistake in fact may be returned to the Employer within one year of the date of the contribution. 
M.  Qualified Domestic Relations Order. This Plan must follow the terms of any qualified domestic relations order issued with respect to a Participant. A "Qualified Domestic Relations Order" is any judgment, decree or order, including the approval of a property settlement or agreement, provided that: 
1.  The order relates to the provision of child support, alimony or marital property rights and is made pursuant to state domestic relations or community property laws; 
2.  The order creates or recognizes the existence of an Alternate Payee's right to receive all or a portion of a Participant's Account balance; 
3.  The order specifies the name and last known mailing address of the Participant and each Alternate Payee covered by the order; 
4.  The order specifies the amount or percentage of the Participant's Account balance to be paid to each Alternate Payee or the manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined; 
5.  The order specifies the number of payments or the period to which the order applies; 
6.  The order specifically names this Plan as the plan to which the order applies; 
7.  The order does not require this Plan to provide any type of benefits or form of benefits not otherwise provided under this Plan; 
8.  The order does not require the payment of benefits to an Alternate Payee which are required to be paid to another Alternate Payee under another order previously determined by the Committee to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order; and 
9.  If the order requires that payments to the Alternate Payee commence before they commence with respect to the Participant, the order specifies that payments will not commence before the Participant attains or would have attained the earliest allowable retirement age under the Plan. 
    A Qualified Domestic Relations Order may provide that a former Spouse or Domestic Partner of the Participant is to be treated as a surviving Spouse or Domestic Partner for purposes of the death benefit provisions of this Plan. The following sets forth the procedures under which the Committee shall determine whether a domestic relations order properly qualifies. 
    The Committee shall not treat any judgment, order or decree as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, unless it meets all of the requirements set forth above. If the order meets these requirements, the Committee shall follow the terms of the order whether or not this Plan has been joined as a party to the legal proceeding out of which the order arises. Upon receipt of a domestic relations order, the Committee shall notify the Participant and Alternate Payee of: (1) its receipt of the order; and (2) its need to determine the qualified status of the order in accordance with this section. 
    The Alternate Payee may designate a representative to receive copies of future notices with respect to the qualified status of the order. To the extent an order calls for benefits to be paid to an Alternate Payee before the order is determined to be qualified, the Alternate Payee's share of the benefits must be separately accounted for.

Any enhancement to a Participant's retirement benefit under the Plan that is adopted on or after January 1, 2013, will apply only to service performed on or after the operative date (as defined in Section 7522.44 of the Government Code) of the enhancement, and will not be applied to any service performed before that date. This preceding sentence will not apply to any increase to a Participant's annual cost-of-living adjustment under the Plan within existing statutory limits. 
2.  Purchases of Nonqualified Service Credit Prohibited. The purchase of nonqualified service credit, as defined by Section 415(n)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not permitted. 
3.  Reinstatement of Retired Participants. Except as provided under Subsection 2.52.092.B if a Participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under the Plan is employed by, or provides services to, the employer, then the Participant will be subject to reinstatement. For this purpose, "reinstatement" means that the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan will cease, and the Participant will resume participation in the Plan in accordance with Chapter 2.04. 
4.  Exception to Reinstatement. A retired Participant will not be subject to reinstatement under Subsection 2.52.092.B.3 if the following conditions are satisfied: 
a.  The Employer's appointing authority appoints the Participant either during an emergency to prevent stoppage of public business or because he or she has skills needed to perform work of a limited duration. 
b.  The appointment does not exceed a total of nine hundred sixty hours or other equivalent limit in a plan year. 
c.  The rate of pay for the appointment is neither less than the minimum nor more than the maximum paid by the Employer to other employees performing comparable duties, divided by 173.333 to equal an hourly rate. 
d.  The Participant does not earn any benefit under the Plan during the appointment. 
e.  Upon accepting the appointment, the Participant certifies in writing that he or she did not, during the twelve months preceding the appointment, receive any unemployment-insurance compensation arising the Participant's prior employment with the Employer. If the Participant accepts the appointment after receiving that type of compensation, the Employer must terminate the Participant's employment or service on the last day of the current pay period; and, this Subsection 2.52.092.B.4 will not apply to the Participant for twelve months after the termination date. 
f.  The appointment may not begin within the one hundred eighty-day period after the Participant's retirement under the Plan, unless one of the following exceptions applies: (i) the Employer certifies the nature of the employment or service and that the appointment is necessary to fill a critically needed position before one hundred eighty days has passed, and the City Council of the City of Delano approves the appointment at a public meeting (the appointment may not be placed on a consent calendar), or (ii) the Participant is a public safety officer or firefighter. Neither exception, however, will apply if the Participant accepted a retirement incentive upon retirement. 
C.  Provisions Applicable to Post-2012 Participants. This Subsection 2.52.092.C applies only to persons who become Participants on or after January 1, 2013. 
1.  Definition of Compensation. "Compensation" means the normal monthly rate of pay or base pay of the Participant paid by the Employer in cash to similarly situated employees of the same group or class of employment for services rendered on a full-time basis during normal working hours, pursuant to publicly available pay schedules. Deferred amounts will be included in "compensation" when earned rather than when paid. The following amounts are excluded from compensation: 
a.  Any amount that the Committee determines has been paid to increase the Participant's retirement benefits under the Plan. 
b.  Any amount that (i) is paid in-kind to the Participant, or was paid directly to a third-party (other than the Plan) for the Participant's benefit, and (ii) is subsequently converted to and received by the employee in cash. 
c.  Any one-time or ad hoc payments to the Participant. 
d.  Severance or any other payment that is granted or awarded to the Participant in connection with, or in anticipation of, a separation from employment, but is received by the Participant while employed. 
e.  Any payments for unused vacation, annual leave, personal leave, sick leave, or compensatory time off, however denominated. 
f.  Any payments for additional services rendered outside of normal working hours. 
g.  Any Employer-provided allowance, reimbursement, or payment, including, but not limited to, one made for housing, vehicle, or uniforms. 
h.  Compensation for overtime work, other than as defined in Section 207(k) of Title 29 of the United States Code. 
i.  Employer contributions to deferred compensation or defined contribution plans. 
j.  Any bonus paid in addition to the amounts described in Subsection 2.52.092.C. 
k.  Any other form of compensation that the Committee determines is inconsistent with the requirements of Subsection 2.52.092.C.1. 
l.  Any other form of compensation that the Committee determines should not be included in compensation. 
m.  For each calendar year, any amount in excess of the following applicable percentage of the contribution and benefit base specified in section 430(b) of Title 42 of the United States Code on January 1, 2013: (i) one hundred percent, for a Participant whose service is included under the old age, survivors, disability and health insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act; or (ii) one hundred twenty percent, for a Participant whose service is not included under the old age, survivors, disability and health insurance provisions of the federal Social Security Act. The Committee will adjust the annual Compensation limit described in this paragraph after each actuarial valuation of the Plan based on changes to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The adjustment shall be effective annually on the January 1 following the annual valuation. 
2.  Participant Contributions. 
a.  Each Participant must contribute at least fifty percent of the normal cost of the Plan. The initial contribution rate will equal at least the greater of (i) fifty percent of the normal cost rate of the Plan, rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent, or (ii) the current contribution rate of similarly situated employees. The Employer may not pay any portion of this contribution for any Participant. 
b.  Once established, the Participant contribution rate will be adjusted to reflect a change in the normal cost rate, but only if the normal cost rate increases by more than one percent of payroll above or below the normal cost rate in effect on the later of: (i) the date the Participant contribution rate is first established, or (ii) the date of the last adjustment to the Participant contribution rate under this paragraph. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "normal cost rate" means the annual actuarially determined normal cost for the Plan expressed as a percentage of payroll. 
c.  The Participant contribution rate may be more than fifty percent of the normal cost rate, but only if the requirements of Section 7522.30(e) of the Government Code are satisfied. 
d.  To the extent the preceding provisions of this Subsection 2.52.092(C) would impair the terms of any contract or memorandum of understanding (MOU) in effect on January 1, 2013, between the Employer and its employees, those provisions will not apply to the employees covered by that contract or MOU until the earlier of (i) the contract's or MOU's expiration, or (ii) the renewal, amendment, or other extension of the contract or MOU. 
3.  Service Retirement Benefit. 
a.  Each Participant who has (i) completed at least five years of service, (ii) reached age fifty-two (i.e., "Early Retirement Age" for persons who become Participants on or after January 1, 2013), and (iii) filed a written application with the Committee stating when he or she desires to retire, may retire for service and receive a "service retirement benefit." 
b.  The service retirement benefit payable to a Participant upon retirement will equal the percentage of the Participant's Final Average Compensation, as determined in accordance with the following schedule based on the Participant's age at retirement, taken to the preceding quarter year, multiplied by the Participant's Years of Service.

D.  Funding. 
1.  In any plan year, the Employer's contribution to the Plan, in combination with Participant contributions to the Plan, may not be less than the normal cost rate, as defined in Subsection 2.52.092.C.2.b. 
2.  The Committee may suspend contributions only when all of the following occur: 
a.  The Plan is funded by more than one hundred twenty percent, based on the computation by the Plan's actuary in accordance with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board requirements that is included in the annual valuation. 
b.  The Plan's actuary determines, based on the annual valuation, that continuing to accrue excess earnings could result in disqualification of the Plan's tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code. 
c.  The Committee determines that the receipt of any additional contributions required by this subsection would conflict with its fiduciary responsibility set forth in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. 
E.  Felony Convictions. If a Participant who is subject to Sections 7522.70, 7522.72 or 7522.74 of the California Government Code is convicted of a felony described in the applicable section or sections, he or she shall forfeit his or her accrued rights and benefits, and will not accrue further benefits, in the Plan to the extent provided in the applicable section or sections. This paragraph will be interpreted and administered in accordance with the requirements of Sections 7522.70, 7522.72 and 7522.74 of the California Government Code, including, but not limited to, any applicable rules governing return of Participant contributions, notice, and reversal of conviction, which requirements are herein incorporated by this reference.

The amount credited need not be based on any actual service, however the years of service to be credited shall not exceed the actual years of service by more than two years. 
B.  The Employer will determine the amount of the contribution required to purchase the desired credit. The required contribution may not be greater than the estimated increase in the Employer's liability under the Plan resulting from the purchase, as determined by the Plan's actuary using the interest and mortality factors that were used in the Plan's most recent actuarial valuation. 
C.  To purchase service credit under this section, the Participant must, at the time and in the manner specified by the Employer, do the following: (1) file an executed written election with the Board under which the Participant agrees to contribute the amount required to purchase the credit; and (2) transfer an amount equal to the required contribution from the Participant's account under the Employer's "eligible deferred compensation plan" (within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Code) to this Plan, in a manner that satisfies the requirements of section 457(e)(17) of the Code.

(Ord. No. 2011-1221, § 1(Exh. 1), 2-7-2011) 
Appendix B. - Required minimum distributions. 
B.1  General Rules. 
(a)  Precedence and Effective Date. The requirements of this Section shall apply to any distribution of a Participant's interest and will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this Plan. Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this Section apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2002. 
(b)  Requirements of Regulations Incorporated. All distributions required under this Section shall be determined and made in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Code, including the incidental death benefit requirement in section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Code, and the Treasury regulations thereunder. 
(c)  TEFRA § 242(b) Elections. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Section to the contrary, distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. 
B.2  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
(a)  Required Beginning Date. The Participant's entire interest must be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date. 
(b)  Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin. If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest must be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(1)  If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section B.6 of this Appendix, distributions to the surviving Spouse must begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 701/2, if later. 
(2)  If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then, except as provided in Section B.6 of this Appendix, distributions to the Designated Beneficiary must begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died. 
(3)  If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
(4)  If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse are required to begin, this section B.2(b), other than section B.2(b)(1), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant. 
    For purposes of this section B.2(b) and section B.5, unless section B.2(b)(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If section B.2(b)(4) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under section B.2(b)(1). If distributions under an annuity meeting the requirements of this Appendix commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant's surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under section B.2(b)(1)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(c)  Form of Distribution. Unless the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year distributions must be made in accordance with sections B.3, B.4 and B.5 of this Appendix. If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder must be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the Participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9) of the Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
B.3  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
(a)  General Annuity Requirements. If the Participant's interest is to be paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity must satisfy the following requirements: 
(1)  The annuity distributions must be paid in periodic payments made at uniform intervals not longer than one year; 
(2)  The distribution period must be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period described in section B.4 or B.5; 
(3)  Once payments have begun over a period, the period must not be changed except as otherwise permitted by the Plan in accordance with Q&A-13 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations; 
(4)  Payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows: 
(A)  By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; 
(B)  By a constant percentage of less than five percent per year, applied not less frequently than annually; 
(C)  To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the Participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit, but only if there is no longer a survivor benefit because the Beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period described in subsection D. dies or is no longer the Participant's Beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; 
(D)  To provide a final payment upon the Participant's death not greater than the excess of the actuarial present value of the Participant's accrued benefit (within the meaning of section 411(a)(7) of the Code) calculated as of the Annuity Starting Date using the Applicable Interest Rate defined in section 5.11(d) of the Plan and the Applicable Mortality Table defined in section 5.11(e) of the Plan (or, if greater, the total amount of employee contributions) over the total of payments before the Participant's death; 
(E)  To allow a Beneficiary to convert the survivor portion of a joint and survivor annuity into a single sum distribution upon the Participant's death; or 
(F)  To pay increased benefits that result from a Plan amendment. 
(b)  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date and Later Payment Intervals. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section B.2(b)(1) or (2)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first Distribution Calendar Year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Participant's Required Beginning Date. 
(c)  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Participant in a calendar year after the first Distribution Calendar Year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such benefit accrues. 
B.4  Requirements For Annuity Distributions That Commence During Participant's Lifetime. 
(a)  Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary Is Not the Participant's Spouse. If the Participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-Spouse Beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant's Required Beginning Date to the Designated Beneficiary after the Participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2(c)(2) of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations; provided, however, that if the Participant's Annuity Starting Date precedes the year in which the Participant attains age seventy, the Participant's and non-Spouse Designated Beneficiary's age difference must be adjusted as set forth in Q&A-2(c)(1) in order to determine the applicable percentage as provided in the table set forth in Q&A-2(c)(2). If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-Spouse Beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the Designated Beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(b)  Period Certain Annuities. Unless the Participant's Spouse is the sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Annuity Starting Date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age seventy, the applicable distribution period for the Participant is the distribution period for age seventy under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of seventy over the age of the Participant as of the Participant's birthday in the year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. If the Participant's Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this section B.4(b), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's Spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Q&A-3 of section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations using the Participant's and Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and Spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. 
B.5  Requirements For Minimum Distributions After the Participant's Death. 
(a)  Death After Distributions Begin. If the Participant dies after distribution of the Participant's interest begins in the form of an annuity meeting the requirements of this Appendix, the remaining portion of the Participant's interest will continue to be distributed over the remaining period over which distributions commenced. 
(b)  Death Before Distributions Begin. 
(1)  Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. Except as provided in Section B.6, if the Participant dies before the date distribution of the Participant's interest begins and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in sections B.2(b)(1) or (2), over the life of the Designated Beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(A)  Unless the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year, the Life Expectancy of the Designated Beneficiary determined using the Beneficiary's age as of the Beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the Participant's death; or 
(B)  If the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year, the Life Expectancy of the Designated Beneficiary determined using the Beneficiary's age as of the Beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the Annuity Starting Date. 
(2)  No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
(3)  Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Begin. If the Participant dies before the date distribution of the Participant's interest begins, the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and the surviving Spouse dies before distributions to the surviving Spouse begin, this Section B.5 will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section B.2(b)(1). 
B.6  Election of Five-Year Rule. Participants and Beneficiaries may elect on an individual basis whether the five-year rule or the life expectancy rule in Sections B.2(b) and B.5(b) of this Appendix applies to distributions after the death of the Participant who has a Designated Beneficiary. The election must be made no later than the earlier of September 30 of the calendar year in which the distribution would be required to begin under Section B.2(b), or by September 30 of the calendar year which contains the fifth anniversary of the Participant's (or, if applicable, the surviving Spouse's) death. If neither the Participant, nor the Designated Beneficiary makes an election under this Section, distributions will be made in accordance with Sections B.2(b) and B.5(b) of this Appendix. 
B.7  Definitions. The following words and phrases used in this Appendix B have the following meanings: 
(a)  Designated Beneficiary. "Designated Beneficiary" means the individual who is designated as the Beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4 of the Treasury regulations. 
(b)  Distribution Calendar Year. "Distribution Calendar Year" means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first Distribution Calendar Year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section B.2(b) of this Appendix B. 
(c)  Life Expectancy. "Life Expectancy" means life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations.

3.08.010 - General provisions. 
    The procedures of this chapter are adopted in accordance with provisions of Sections 54201 through 54205 of the Government Code of the State of California. This does not cover the procurement or reimbursement of travel expenses, as they may be treated by other government ordinance or resolution. 
A.  Purchasing Authority. The finance department shall oversee the purchasing function that is administered by each department. Each department shall be responsible for purchasing its own needs subject to the approval by the department head. The approval of purchases of less than five thousand dollars may be delegated to supervisory staff as deemed necessary for maximum efficiency and control. No expenditures shall be made without the appropriate reviews and approval as provided in this chapter. 
B.  Purchasing Goals. The purchasing procedures described in this chapter aim to achieve the following goals: 
1.  To establish efficient procedures for the purchase of supplies, equipment and services; 
2.  To procure for the city, supplies, equipment, and services at the lowest possible cost commensurate with quality and quantity needed; 
3.  To exercise positive financial control and accountability over purchasing; 
4.  To give preference to local merchants, with quality and price being equal (when accounting for additional costs such as shipping vs. travel time to pick up or deliver an item, or sales tax to be received by the city); 
5.  To minimize the need for warehousing thereby saving space, insurance and handling costs; 
6.  To clearly define authority and responsibilities for the purchasing function. 
C.  Centralized Purchasing. Centralized purchasing shall be encouraged as a means of acquiring goods and services common to many departments. Such efforts may result in cost savings like volume discounts and will eliminate duplication of effort. All computer hardware and software purchases shall be reviewed by the information systems coordinator for consistency and compatibility. Centralization is recommended for departments close and adjacent to each other and shall be zoned as follows: city hall, police, corporation yard, CCF, and community services. Centralized purchasing is recommended for such items as fuel oil, motor vehicle parts, office supplies and stationery. 
D.  Budget Transfers. Budget overruns shall not be tolerated but may be remedied through budget transfers. From time to time, budget transfers may be needed to pay for some higher than anticipated costs in purchasing supplies and services, or for existing capital improvement projects. Budget transfers shall be allowed only for line items within a division, subject to approval by the city manager with the following caps: 
1.  New capital outlay over five thousand dollars and all budget transfers for items other than capital outlay in excess of thirty-five thousand dollars shall be approved by the city council. 
2.  Budget transfers shall not be allowed for new capital improvement projects. 
3.  Budget transfers shall be certified by the finance director for no new money appropriations and approved by the city manager through an appropriations transfer request. 
4.  Budget transfers subject to the approval of the city council shall be included in the consent agenda accompanied by a duly approved appropriations transfer request staff report and city council resolution. 
E.  Purchasing Principles. Generally, the procurement procedure involves the determination of quantity, quality and related requirements, negotiation and canvassing of prices, referral of bids for analysis and recommendations, award of purchase order and contracts, the supervision of receipt and acceptance procedures and the approval of invoices for payments. Except as provided herewith, the following purchasing functions shall be observed on a departmental level. Each department: 
1.  Shall process the purchase of and contract for all supplies, equipment and contractual personal services, according to its needs;

The finance department shall prescribe, design and issue forms needed for the purchasing function and shall process payments of purchases with the assurance that such purchases were authorized, that the items purchased were actually received in a satisfactory manner, that the quantity and prices indicated in the purchase order are the same as those indicated in the invoice. Any variance noted between the purchase order and the invoice shall have to be authorized and confirmed by the department head before payment of the invoice; 
9.  The finance department shall also maintain a bidders' list, vendor's catalog file and other records used in modern procurement operations; 
10.  The city clerk shall receive and process all formal bids to assure that every bidder complies with all applicable municipal, state and federal safety regulations. 
F.  Specifications. 
1.  As needed, each department shall develop standards specifications for repetitively procured items and services. 
2.  Every specification shall be prepared to assure the broadest possible bidder participation, consistent with the needs of the using department or agency. 
3.  Alternate specification provisions for any particular bid invitation may be established. 
4.  No oral interpretation of any written specification shall be made to any bidder as to the meaning of the specification. If a prospective bidder discovers discrepancies or omissions in any specification or if the bidder is in doubt as to the naming of the specification, the bidder shall request clarification or modification from the city in writing and delivered to the person authorized in the specification at least five days before the time specified for the opening of bids, unless a different time is specified in the specifications.

(Ord. 1156 § 1 (Exh. A), 2007; Ord. 1146 § 1(part), 2006). 
(Ord. No. 2013-1258, § 1(exh. A), 4-15-2013) 
3.08.020 - Purchase requisition procedure. 
A.  Purchase Requisitions. Prior to initiating a purchase, department heads or their designees shall submit a purchase order request form for supplies, materials, maintenance and equipment to the finance department. By approving the purchase request, the department head or his designee shall ensure that the appropriate purchasing procedures have been followed. 
    By approving the purchase, the finance director or his/her designee shall confirm the existence of a budgetary appropriation, that sufficient funds are available, that the account distribution and calculations of cost are accurate. 
    Following confirmation, the finance department shall prepare a purchase order, consistent with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Purchase Orders. Upon appropriate approval, purchase orders shall be distributed as follows: 
Original To vendor (via department buying) Copy To department buying Copy To finance department  
    The finance department shall encumber the amount of the purchase order in the designated budgetary accounts as a reduction of the funds budgeted for that line item. Unless it is an emergency, no purchase orders shall be allowed fifteen days before the end of the fiscal year. This will simplify closing and budgeting procedures and avoid rush purchases. Any unused purchases upon which purchase orders have been placed and a binding obligation of the city shall be reappropriated in the following fiscal year as a consent agenda item. 
    Upon receipt of goods and/or completion of services, the user department head or his designee shall provide proof of receipt of goods or services and provide invoices to the finance department. The finance department shall proceed with processing payment to the vendor. Partial payments shall be permitted when materials, supplies or equipment are received in separate shipments. 
C.  Open Purchase Arrangements. 
1.  Open Purchase Orders. Open purchase orders are similar to a charge account set up by the city with certain vendors to provide small equipment or supplies on an "as needed" basis. A blanket order provides a mechanism for purchasing items locally, which are not economical for either the operating department or central stores (garage parts, for example) to stock. This allows employees timely access to materials needed to accomplish their work. 
Open purchase orders shall not be used to purchase services, capital items or items stored in central stores. Once an open purchase order is issued to a vendor, any authorized city employee may contact the vendor directly to order items per the terms and conditions specified on the open purchase order. 
Some reasons to consider using an open purchase order include: 
a.  Less paperwork; 
b.  Quantity purchasing power, possibly combining needs of more than one department; 
c.  Price protection for a specified period of time; 
d.  Minimizes on-site inventory (pay-as-you-go); 
e.  Provides an organized procedure for reviewing purchases of like items. 
For open purchase arrangements, the requirements for quotes or bids shall be waived because it is assumed that a diverse and variable quantity in a particular category shall be required on a contingent "as needed" basis. Because of the diverse, variable and contingent nature of such purchases, quotes and bids are not feasible. However, no individual item may exceed a daily order of one thousand dollars or a unit cost of one thousand dollars. 
To avoid storing excessive amounts of emergency repair and replacement parts and caustic chemicals and food, the water, wastewater, garage, and streets divisions of the public works department, senior citizens' nutrition program and the CCF (for raw food), may go beyond the spending limit of one thousand dollars per day. 
2.  Open Purchase Order Exceptions. The following items shall not be purchased on an open purchase order: 
a.  Tools, both power and hand types, regardless of cost; 
b.  Office furniture and large office equipment; 
c.  Capital outlay and improvement items. 
3.  Open purchase orders shall set a limit on the total amount by indicating the words "Not to Exceed." All open purchase orders exceeding thirty-five thousand dollars shall be included as a consent agenda item except for the waiver provided for in Resolution 2000-108. 
4.  After the open purchase order is approved, department staff may then order goods or services and then applied against the purchase order. Each department head shall be responsible for monitoring daily purchases using open purchase orders so as not to exceed budgetary appropriations. 
5.  Revolving Fund/Petty Cash. A centralized revolving fund shall be maintained by the finance department for the purchase of seventy-five dollars or less from vendors without open purchase orders. All petty cash purchases shall be accomplished through a petty cash voucher supported by documentary proof of purchase such as receipts or invoices. 
(Ord. 1146 §1(part), 2006). 
3.08.030 - Vendor quotation/call for bids-Supplies, materials, maintenance and equipment. 
    Purchases of supplies, materials, maintenance and equipment shall strictly adhere to the following quotation/call for bids requirements dictated by the dollar amount of the purchase. The quotation/call for bids requirements and dollar limits are as follows: 
A.  Immediate Procurement Procedure/Up to One Thousand Dollars. Each department head may exercise his/her own discretion with regard to vendor choices with preference given to local merchants, with quality and price being equal. 
The department shall identify the necessary supplies, services or equipment and complete a requisition form with the appropriate account number(s) approved by the department head and forwarded to the finance department so that the expenditure is immediately encumbered. This requisition can immediately be used and submitted to the vendor to obtain the supplies or services. No purchase order is necessary unless the vendor requests for it. 
B.  Verbal Quotation Procedure/One Thousand One Dollars to Two Thousand Dollars. Each department head or his/her designee shall acquire a verbal quote from at least three vendors. Telephone quotes shall be documented on a telephone sheet. The department head shall select the vendor and shall identify the necessary supplies, services or equipment and complete a requisition form approved by him with appropriate account numbers. The requisition form shall be forwarded to the finance department that prepares the purchase order after verifying that all procedures have been followed. The finance department shall encumber the amount. A formal purchase order is needed before procuring supplies and/or services at this level. 
C.  Written Quotation Procedure/Two Thousand One Dollars to Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars. Each department head or his/her designee shall solicit written quotations from at least three vendors. Vendors shall submit by fax or e-mail or letter, their written quotations directly to the departments seeking quotations. The department head shall select the vendor and shall then complete a requisition form with the appropriate account numbers. The requisition form shall be approved by the department head or his/her designee and shall be forwarded to the finance department for purchase order preparation after verifying that all purchase procedures have been complied with. All purchases costing thirty-five thousand dollars and over shall be approved by the city council as a consent agenda item except for the waiver provided in Resolution 2000-108. 
Exceptions. The written quotation procedure shall be waived for the following types of purchases: 
1.  Purchase of vehicles or equipment which are acquired at a public auction. These purchases shall have prior approval by the city manager or his/her designee; 
2.  Purchases of vehicles or equipment through cooperative agreements with the State of California or other public agencies; 
3.  Where the vendors are selected by other agencies under contract with the city through their normal purchasing procedures. 
D.  Formal Purchasing Procedure/Call for Bids Over Thirty-Five Dollars. A formal bid shall be required if the estimated dollar amount of the purchase, including tax, shipping and related costs, exceeds thirty-five thousand dollars. Capital improvement purchasing procedures are further elaborated in Section 3.08.070. 
1.  The department head or his/her designee shall prepare a bid package to solicit bids from qualified firms. The bid package shall consist of the following items: 
a.  Notice inviting bids; 
b.  Information to bidders; 
c.  Bid specifications; 
d.  Proposal form; 
e.  Insurance and/or bond requirements. 
Notice inviting bids shall include a general description of the articles to be purchased and shall state where the bid forms and specifications may be secured, as well as the time and place for the opening of bids. The notice shall specify which factors will be given special consideration in determining the lowest responsible bidder. 
When considered necessary, bidders' security may be prescribed in the notice inviting bids. Bidders shall be entitled to return of bid securities, provided, however, that the successful bidder shall forfeit the bid security upon the refusal of the bidder to execute the contract within the time designated in the bid specifications. The council, on the refusal or failure of the successful bidder to execute the contract, may award the contract to the next lowest responsible bidder. If the council awards the contract to the next lowest bidder, the amount of the lowest bidder's security shall be applied by the city to the contract price differential between the lowest bid and the second lowest bid, and the surplus, if any, shall be returned to the lowest bidder. Lowest responsible bidder shall mean the bidder which best responds to the price, quality, service, fitness or capacity to the particular requirements of the city. Price alone shall not be the determining factor but shall be considered along with other factors relating to the particular needs of the city. 
Example: Clause to add to bid requirements: 
The bidders must not appear on any list of debarred, suspended or ineligible concerns or individuals that would compromise the funding agency's ability to comply with Executive Orders 12549 and 126898 related to "Debarment and Suspension." 
2.  The city clerk shall administer the bidding process and shall follow bid procedures regarding posting notices, sending notice inviting bids, receiving bids, and opening and tabulation of bids. Confidentiality of bids shall be maintained and shall not be disclosed directly or indirectly to any other bidder until the bidding is closed or other further bidding is excluded. If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality or service being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the re-advertising of bids, the city council may accept the one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of opening. Before bid opening, ensure none of the bidders are debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded. If any are, reject those bids before opening them. 
3.  The city council shall have the authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract in such amount as it finds reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the city. If the city council requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids. 
4.  When the council finds that it is in the public interest and necessity or that it is impractical to purchase supplies or equipment without compliance with formal contract procedures set forth in this section, the council may waive such procedures by so declaring with a separate motion or resolution. 
5.  The council reserves the right to reject any or all bids or to waive any irregularities or informalities in any bid or all bidding and to determine which bid in the judgment of the council is the lowest responsible bidder and which bid should be accepted in the best interest of the city. 
6.  The department head shall recommend award of contract to the lowest responsible bidder to the city manager. The department shall prepare an agenda report and present it to the city manager, who shall then present the item to the city council as a regular agenda item. In all cases, price shall not be the sole determining factor, but shall be considered along with other factors, including, but not limited to, ability of the vendor to deliver, ability to service, prior experience, quality, compatibility with existing city equipment, and other particular needs of the city. 
7.  Upon award of contract by the city council, the department head or his/her designee shall submit a purchase requisition with award recommendation and documentation, appropriate account numbers, including contract, if applicable, to the finance department which shall prepare the purchase order. 
8.  After award of the contract by the city council, the vendor awarded the contract shall be notified by the city clerk. 
9.  The city clerk shall send notices to vendor(s) not selected. 
(Ord. 1146 §1(part), 2006). 
(Ord. No. 2013-1258, § 1(exh. A), 4-15-2013) 
3.08.040 - Emergency purchases. 
A.  An emergency is a situation in which the delay in procurement of material, equipment or service may jeopardize the life, health, welfare, or convenience of local residents, or the city manager determines that an emergency purchase is necessary to ensure operational efficiency and/or fiscal responsibility of the city.

1.  There is a great public disaster. 
2.  There is an immediate need to prepare for a national or local defense. 
3.  There is a breakdown in machinery or an essential service which requires the immediate procurement of supplies or equipment or services to protect the public health, welfare or safety. 
4.  An essential departmental operation affecting the public health, welfare or safety would be greatly hampered if the prescribed purchase would cause an undue delay in the procurement of the needed item. 
B.  Each department head may exercise his/her own discretion with regard to vendor choice with preference given to local merchants, with quality and price being equal. The department identifies necessary supplies, services or equipment and completes a purchase request clearly labeled "EMERGENCY PURCHASE." The request shall be accompanied by a fully costed invoice duly signed by the department head and forwarded to the finance department, who shall follow up with the issuance of a purchase order. The request number is all that is needed at this level, though a formal purchase order is issued later. 
C.  Emergency purchases in excess of five thousand dollars shall require written approval by the city manager or his/her designee. 
(Ord. 1146 §1(part), 2006). 
3.08.050 - Sole-source vendors. 
    Sole-source specifications shall be avoided whenever possible, as they minimize or eliminate competition. The appropriate authority may waive bidding requirements if sufficient written justification for a sole-source purchase exists. In the case of sole-source vendors, a department head or his/her designee shall indicate a "sole source" notation on the requisition and forward it to the finance department before a purchase order is approved. Sole-source vendors shall include those that provide equipment, parts, supplies and services that are uniquely compatible to existing equipment or systems. Any sole-source purchase in excess of thirty-five thousand dollars shall be approved by the city council except for the waiver provided for in Resolution 2000-108.

The request shall include identification of the unencumbered funding source for the project, based on the estimated project cost. The request shall include a bid opening date, which shall be approved by the city clerk. 
E.  City council approval is required for all plans and specifications for capital improvements prepared by the city engineer. If the project involves federal or state dollars, the department shall observe federal and state statutes regarding the bidding process and selection of vendors. 
F.  The sealed bids shall be received by the city clerk who shall be responsible for publicly opening and reading sealed bids at the stipulated time.

1.  Cause the project to go over budget; 
2.  Require transfers between funds and reserves;

State Law reference- For statutory provisions authorizing cities to impose a tax on transients who occupy room space within the city limits, see Rev. & Tax. Code §§7280, 7281. 

3.20.010 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax law of the City of Delano. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.020 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter, as follows: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile-home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. "Hotel" does not include a private home, vacation cabin or similar facility which is rented by a person who is not regularly engaged in the business of renting such facility and does so only occasionally and incidentally to his own use thereof; 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes; 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both; 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit; 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever;

G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified herein may be considered. 
(Ord. 1078 § 1(part), 2002; Ord. 457 § 1(part), 1965) 
3.20.030 - Tax imposed. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 915 § 1, 1991: Ord. 594 § 1, 1973: Ord. 519 § 1, 1968: Ord. 457 § 1(part), 1965).

(Ord. 469 § 1, 1965; Ord. 457 § 1(part), 1965) 
3.20.050 - Operator's duties. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.

The certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The name and address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator of the City of Delano. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit."; 
E.  Such additional information as may be required by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 457 § 1(part), 1965). 
3.20.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the previous month, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 1078 § 1(part), 2002: Ord. 457 § 1(party, 1965). 
3.20.080 - Penalties and interest. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter, within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B). 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 457 § 1(part), 1965). 
3.20.090 - Failure to collect and report tax-Determination of amount due. 
    If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he deems best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.20.100. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.100 - Appeal. 
    Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.110 - Records. 
    It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.120 - Refunds-Claim filing. 
    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in Sections 3.20.130 and 3.20.140; provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.130 - Operator may claim refund when. 
    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.140 - Refund to transient. 
    A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city filing a claim in the manner provided in Section 3.20.120, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.150 - Establishing right to refund. 
    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this chapter unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.160 - Actions to collect. 
    Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Ord. 457 §1(part), 1965). 
3.20.170 - Violations-Penalties. 
    Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable as provided in Chapter 1.16. 
    Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this division to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax chapter which shall be operative if a simple majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the State of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
C.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Tax. 
D.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made.

Such estimate, if accepted by the collector as reasonable, shall be used in determining the amount of business tax to be paid by the applicant; provided, however, the amount of the business tax so determined shall be tentative only, and such person shall, within thirty days after the expiration of the period for which such business tax certificate was issued, furnish the collector with a sworn statement, upon a form furnished by the collector, showing the gross receipts during the period of such business tax certificate, and the business tax for such period shall be finally ascertained and paid in the manner provided by this chapter, for the ascertaining and paying of renewal business taxes for other businesses, after deducting from the payment found to be due, the amount paid at the time such first business tax certificate was issued.

In case of failure to apply for a business tax certificate, a ten-percent penalty shall be added to the tax due. 
    If the collector is not satisfied with the information supplied in statements or applications filed, he may determine the amount of any business tax due by means of any information he may be able to obtain.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Prior ordinance history: Ords. 906 and 944. 

9.26.010 - Intent. 
    Graffiti on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property, but also the value of the adjacent and surrounding areas. Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes a city to enact ordinances to provide for use of city funds to remove graffiti from public and privately owned permanent structures located within the city. The City Council of the City of Delano finds that graffiti or related inscribed materials is obnoxious and, pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.3, authorizes that a program be instituted allowing for the use of city funds to remove graffiti on public and private property. It is the city council's further intent to provide for the prohibition of the placement of graffiti on public or private property as set forth in this chapter. 
(Ord. 1097 §1(part), 2003). 
9.26.020 - Graffiti defined. 
    "Graffiti" means any inscription, word, figure or design marked, etched, scratched, drawn or painted upon the surface of a building, structure, tree, shrub, fence, walkway, light standard, sidewalk, or any other facility, regardless of the material used on such surface, without the written permission of the owner, or owner's representative, through the use of a graffiti implement or aerosol paint.

(Ord. 1097 §1(part), 2003). 
9.26.030 - Purposes. 
    The Delano city council does hereby find that: 
A.  The increase of graffiti on both public and private buildings, structures, and in other places creates a condition of blight within the city, which can result in the actual or perceived deterioration of property values, business opportunities, and enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding properties. 
B.  The continued existence of graffiti is inconsistent with the city's standards for property maintenance, crime prevention, and aesthetic standards; and, unless graffiti is quickly removed from public and private properties, other properties soon become the target of graffiti vandalism. 
C.  Graffiti, defacement and other similar acts of vandalism are inimical and destructive of the rights of owners and tenants, and to the values of public and private property, and thus are injurious to the community welfare. 
D.  The presence of graffiti and graffiti-attracting surfaces within the city are public nuisances. 
E.  The purposes of this article are to protect the public welfare by prohibiting graffiti vandalism, prescribing penalties for violation of its provisions, establishing a graffiti abatement program as authorized by Government Code Section 56069.3, and establishing a cost-recovery program to assist the city in the eradication of graffiti.

Chapter 9.37 - LOUD OR UNRULY EVENTS 
Sections: 

9.37.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means for recovering the costs incurred by the city for the city police and fire department personnel participating in a second or subsequent response to a loud or unruly event from the person or persons responsible for such event or multiple responses to multiple loud or unruly events at the same address. 
    Further, this chapter is intended to deter the service to, and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons. This purpose is implemented by the imposition of a civil money penalty against social hosts and landowners (including landlords) for loud or unruly events where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by, underage persons. 
    A violation of this chapter shall be a civil offense separate from any potential criminal implications. As such, violators may be subject to the civil remedies available to the City of Delano, such as fines, restitution and abatement measures. Further, unlike criminal offenses, a violation of this chapter does not carry the possibility of incarceration. 
(Ord. 2008-1181 § 1(part), 2008). 
9.37.020 - Findings. 
    The city council finds as follows: 
A.  That personnel from this city police and fire departments spend a significant amount of their time responding to loud and unruly events as defined in this chapter. 
B.  That frequently, police and fire department personnel are required to respond a second or multiple times to the same loud or unruly event after warning the person or persons responsible for such event that the event is being conducted in an unlawful manner and must be terminated and that frequently, a response is required because those responsible failed to take the steps necessary to terminate such unlawful conduct. 
C.  That frequently, police and fire department personnel are required to respond multiple times to the same address for multiple loud or unruly events after warning the person or persons responsible for such events that they are being conducted in an unlawful manner and that frequently, a response is required because those responsible failed to take the steps necessary to prevent the occurrence of further unlawful events at that address. 
D.  That it would be appropriate to recover from the person or persons responsible for a loud or unruly event that costs incurred by the city for the police and fire department personnel participating in a second or subsequent response to an address in those situations in which such person or persons were duly warned at the time of the initial response that a service fee would be assessed against them if further responses were required due to the continuation of the unlawful event or the occurrence of future unlawful events. 
E.  That the occurrence of loud and unruly events were alcoholic beverages are served to, or consumed by, underage persons is harmful to the underage persons involved and a threat to public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property and the general welfare. Underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at events that are under the control of a person who knows, or should know, of the underage consumption of alcohol. 
F.  That in many cases, persons having possession or control of property who are responsible for the occurrence of loud or unruly events on that property have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to, nor consumed by, underage persons that these events. Furthermore, problems associated with loud or unruly events where alcoholic beverages are served to, consumed by underage persons are difficult to prevent and deter unless the Delano police department has the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering. 
G.  That law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have and are required to, respond, sometimes on multiple occasions in the same calendar year to loud and unruly events resulting in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and delaying official responses to regular and emergency calls in the rest of the city. Additionally, underage drinking at such events has resulted in disproportionately higher numbers of underage persons driving while intoxicated, increased social violence, and incidents of sexual assault. 
(Ord. 2008-1181 § 1(part), 2008). 
9.37.030 - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined as follows: 
    "Alcohol" means ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl, or spirits of wine, from whatever source or by whatever process produced.

    "Juvenile" means any person under eighteen years of age. 
    A "loud event" means an event or incident which results in any loud or unusual noise which disturbs the peace and quiet of a neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of normal sensitivity residing in the neighborhood and is unlawful under the provisions of Chapter 9.37. "Persons responsible," for purpose of this chapter, means a person over the age of eighteen shall be considered to be responsible for an event if: 
1.  Such person is entitled to possession of any private property on which the event occurs, either by reason of the fact that such person is an owner entitled to possession of such property or by reason of the fact that such person is a lessee or tenant entitled to possession of the property; 
2.  Such person is entitled to the use of any public property or, which the event occurs by reason of any permit or entitlement issued to such person by the city or any other governmental agency owning or otherwise controlling the property; or 
3.  Such person accepts responsibility for the event. 
    A responsible person for a loud or unruly event need not be present at such event resulting in the response giving rise to the imposition of civil money penalties or response costs.

(Ord. 2008-1181 § 1(part), 2008). 
9.37.050 - Warning issued at time of initial response.

Such warning shall set forth the date and time of the initial response, a brief description of the unlawful activity complained of and/or observed at the event, the address of the property on which the event occurred, and a statement that if city police or fire department personnel are required to respond a second time or a subsequent time to the same address within a twenty-four-hour period because of the same event or another event by reason of the fact that the event continues to be conducted in an unlawful manner or by reason of the fact that future events are loud or unruly events as defined in Section 9.37.030 of this chapter, such person or persons may be assessed a service fee for the city's second or subsequent response costs in the amount provided for by this chapter. Such warning shall also state that the service fee, if any, shall be in addition to any criminal fine or other sanction arising out of any arrest of such person or the issuance of a citation to such person as a result of such response or responses.

B.  At the time of making such initial response, personnel from the city police or fire department warned such person or persons, in writing, that the event was being conducted in an unlawful manner, and that if police or fire department personnel were required to respond a second time or multiple times to the address because of the same loud or unruly event or other loud or unruly events, a service fee for the city's response; and 
C.  Following such initial response, the city police or fire department were required to respond a second or subsequent time to the same address by reason of the fact that either the event continued to be conducted in an unlawful manner, or another loud or unruly event was held in an unlawful manner at the same address, notwithstanding such previous written warning. 
(Ord. 2008-1181 § 1(part), 2008).

If the chief of police or his designee determines that a second response or subsequent response has been made to a loud or unruly event within a twenty-four-hour period following the initial response to the same address, the chief of police or his designee may assess a service fee against any person or persons responsible for the event who was issued a written warning at the time of the initial response to the event in the manner provided by this chapter. Such service fee shall be consistent with the actual costs incurred by the city for all of the police and/or fire department personnel participating in the second, or subsequent response, or the sum of one thousand dollars, whichever is less. Where two or more persons are assessed a service fee for the same response to a loud or unruly event, all such persons shall be jointly and severally liable to the city for the full amount of such fee. Each response by city police or fire department personnel is a separate event, and a corresponding serve fee may be assessed for each such response that occurs within thirty days after an initial warning is given.

In the event of the failure of a person assessed a service fee or fees to pay such fee when due a delinquency penalty of ten percent shall be added to the fee on the last day of each month after the due date thereof provided, however, that the total amount of such penalties shall not exceed fifty percent of the fee or fees. In addition, in the event of the failure of a person assessed a service fee or fees to pay such fee or fees when due, such person shall be assessed interest on the amount of the delinquent fee or fees, exclusive of any penalties thereon, at the rate of one percent per month, or any fraction thereof, from the date the fee or fees first became delinquent until the date the fee or fees is paid.

    "Alarm systems" means any mechanical or electrical device which is designed or used for either the detection of fire or instruction into a building, structure or facility or both, which detection causes a local audible alarm or transmission of a signal or message, or which is used to evoke police or fire department response, whether the alarm system is monitored or not by an alarm agent. Alarm systems include, but are not limited to, direct-dial telephone devices. Devices which are not designed or used to evoke police or fire response and devices which are designed so as not to be audible, visible, or perceptible outside of the protected building, structure or facility are considered as alarm systems if an actual police or fire response occurs, irrespective of how the police or fire departments were notified.

A false alarm shall not include alarms caused by malfunction of telephone line circuits or external causes beyond the control of the owner or lessee of the alarm system. 
    "Misuse" means the actual activation of an alarm system to summon the aid of police or fire services when the actual circumstances would otherwise prompt a routine (nonemergency) response from police or fire personnel. 
    "Person" means a person, firm, corporation, association, partnership, individual, organization or company.

The lessee or owner of any alarm system or audible alarm system that is not monitored by an alarm agent or alarm business, shall at the time of obtaining their alarm permit, provide the police department with emergency contact information for the lessee or owner, and at least two additional emergency contact numbers for a responsible party to respond, in the event of an alarm activation, upon the request of the police department or fire department. Information that must be provided to the alarm agent, alarm business, or police department shall include, name, address, and telephone number of lessee or owner, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers for at least two additional emergency contacts.

All costs associated with the securing of any alarm location due to the failure of the owner, lessee, or other emergency contact as listed in Section 9.70.030 to respond, shall be the sole responsibility of the alarm owner or lessee.

    On November 7, 2006, the voters of the State of California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 83 "The Sexual Predator Punishment and Control Act: Jessica's Law," so as to better protect Californians, and the children of this state in particular, from sex offenders. Proposition 83 enacted new subsection (b) of Penal Code 3003.5 which made it unlawful for any registered sex offender to reside within two thousand feet of any public or private school, or any park where children regularly gather. In addition, Proposition 83 specifies in subsection (c) of Penal Code Section 3003.5 that municipal jurisdictions may enact local ordinances that further restrict the residency of sex offenders. The city council of the City of Delano has determined that the factors set forth in Section 2 of Proposition 83, including the high recidivism rate of sex offenders and the frequency with which they prey on victims under the age of eighteen, make it incumbent upon the City of Delano to enact additional restrictions as to control behavior by sex offenders to decrease the potential for their victimization of children and to protect its residents.

A.  When any well is to be constructed or reconstructed in such a manner that it will penetrate two or more water bearing strata, one or more of which has been determined by the city engineer to contain ground water of a quality which will cause the degradation of ground water in the other strata if the waters are allowed to intermingle, the undesirable stratum shall be sealed off to prevent the flow of the poor quality water through the annular space from degrading water in the strata containing water of an acceptable quality. 
B.  Whenever an aquifer containing poor quality water is required to be sealed off as provided in subsection A of this section, a minimum of a twenty foot annual seal shall be placed in the confining formation separating the aquifers containing poor quality water from the aquifers containing acceptable quality water. An electrical geophysical log of the well shall be run to assist in the placement of the annular seal, and a copy made available to the city engineer. The strata producing the undesirable quality water shall be sealed off by pumping an impervious material opposite the strata no less than twenty feet, even when the confining formation is less than twenty feet in thickness. The sealing material shall fill the annular space in the interval to be sealed and the surrounding void spaces which absorb the sealing material. The sealing material shall be placed from the bottom to the top of the interval to be sealed. 
C.  Gravel chute shall extend through the annular seal at least two feet into the gravel pack. 
D.  Sealing materials shall consist of neat cement, cement grout or cement. In areas of subsidence or under special conditions, the use of other approved sealing materials may be allowed with prior approval of the city engineer. 
E.  In areas where deep subsidence may occur (as, for example, portions of the San Joaquin Valley), provision shall be made for maintaining the integrity of the annular seal in the event of subsidence. Such preventive measures may include the installation of sleeve or slip joint in the casing, which will allow vertical movement in the casing without its collapse. 
(Ord. 901 (part), 1990). 
13.09.160 - Well development or redevelopment. 
A.  Developing, redeveloping, or conditioning of a well shall be done with care and by methods which will not cause damage to the well or cause adverse subsurface conditions that may destroy barriers to the vertical movement of water between aquifers. The following methods used in the developing, redeveloping, or conditioning of a well when done with care are acceptable: 
1.  Overpumping; 
2.  Surging by use of a plunger; 
3.  Surging with compressed air; 
4.  Backwashing or surging by alternately starting and stopping the pump; 
5.  Jetting with water; 
6.  Introduction of chemicals designed for this purpose; 
7.  Bailing;

The concrete slab shall be constructed so as to adequately drain water away from the well casing. Where deviation from this pattern of construction would serve a practical purpose without lessening well protection, the city engineer may approve such deviation. All wells shall be provided with a sanitary seal so as to prevent surface water from entering the well. Each slab (or well) shall be identified by the name of the owner on the well permit, or APN number, or other approved method. 
B.  In those cases where it is not possible to meet the horizontal setback distances from pollution sources described in Section 13.09.080 an alternative means of protection for the well may be to increase the depth of the upper annular seal. Where horizontal setback distances cannot be met or adverse or special hazards exist (such as perched water), the depth of the upper annular seal shall be increased as required by the city engineer. 
C.  In hard rock formations, the minimum depth of seal shall be twenty feet or one foot into hard rock if encountered first. Sampled hard rock cuttings shall be collected and held at the site for inspection by the city engineer.

Chapter 13.10 - CONTROL OF BACKFLOW AND CROSS-CONNECTIONS 
Sections: 
ARTICLE I. - CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL-GENERAL POLICY 

13.10.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is: 
1.  To protect the public potable water supply of city from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the customer's internal distribution system(s) or the consumer's private water system(s) such contaminants or pollutants which could backflow into the public water systems; and 
2.  To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections, actual or potential, between the consumer's in-plant potable water system(s) and nonpotable water system(s), plumbing fixtures and industrial piping systems; and 
3.  To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of all potable water systems. 
(Ord. 908 (part), 1990). 
13.10.020 - Responsibility. 
    The city engineer shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution/system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of said city engineer, an approved backflow prevention assembly is required (at the customer's water service connection; or, within the customer's private water system) for the safety of the water system, the city engineer or his designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved backflow prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on his premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved assembly(s) at the consumer's own expense; and, failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install, have tested and maintain said assembly(s) shall constitute a ground for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
(Ord. 908 (part), 1990). 
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

13.10.025 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions set forth in the following sections shall apply throughout this chapter. 
A.  Water Commissioner or Health Official. The City Engineer of the City of Delano is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  "Approved" means accepted by the city engineer as meeting an applicable specification stated or cited in this chapter, or as suitable for the proposed use. 
C.  Auxiliary Water Supply. Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public water supply will be considered as an auxiliary water supply. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source(s) such as a well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
D.  "Backflow" means the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either backpressure or backsiphonage. 
E.  "Backpressure" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source or sources other than the intended source. 
F.  "Backsiphonage" means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply from any source other than its intended source caused by the reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system. 
G.  "Backflow preventer" means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow. 
1.  "Air-gap" means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing, fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of said vessel. An approved airgap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the overflow rim of the vessel; and in no case less than one inch. 
2.  "Reduced pressure principle assembly" means an assembly of two independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating mechanically independent differential pressure relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specification as determined by American Water Works Association Standard #AWWA C506-84 and a field evaluation program resulting in the approval by the city engineer. The assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the assembly. At cessation of a normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the assembly will be submerged. 
3.  "Double check valve assembly" means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by American Water Works Association Standard #AWWA C506-84 and field evaluation program resulting in the approval by the city engineer. To be approved, these assemblies must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the assembly will be submerged. 
H.  "Contamination" means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewerage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease. 
I.  "Cross-connection" means any physical connection or arrangement of piping of fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. This would include any temporary connections, such as swing connections, removable sections, four way plug valves, spools, dummy section of pipe, swivel or change-over devices or sliding multiport tube. 
J.  Cross-Connections-Controlled. "Controlled cross-connection" means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
K.  "Cross-connection control by containment" means the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross-connections within the customer's water system; or, it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross-connections which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross-connection. 
L.  Hazard, Degree of. The term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. 
1.  Hazard-Health. "Health hazard" means any condition, device, or practice in the water supply system and its operation which could create, or in the judgment of the city engineer, may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. 
2.  Hazard-Plumbing. "Plumbing hazard" means a plumbing type cross-connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air-gap or approved backflow prevention assembly. 
3.  Hazard-Pollutional. "Pollutional hazard" means an actual or potential threat to the physical properties of the water system or to the potability of the public or the consumer's potable water system but which would constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable or could cause damage to the system or its appurtenances, but would not be dangerous to health. 
4.  Hazard-System. "System hazard" means an actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination which would have a protracted affect on the quality of the potable water in the system. 
M.  "Industrial fluids systems" means any system containing a fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system, pollutional or plumbing hazard if introduced into an approved water supply. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and "used waters" originating from the public potable water system which may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalines; circulating cooling water connected to an open cooling tower and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilized with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as from well, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or system, etc.; oils, gases, glycerine, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes or for fire-fighting purposes. 
N.  "Pollution" means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use. 
O.  Water-Potable. "Potable water" means any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption. 
P.  Water-Nonpotable. "Nonpotable water" means water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability. 
Q.  Water-Service connection. "Service connection" means connection from the public potable water system; i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or any back-flow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system. 
R.  Water-Used. "Used water" means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor. 
(Ord. 908 (part), 1990). 
ARTICLE III. - REQUIREMENTS

Prior history: Ord. 596 as amended by 881. 

13.32.010 - When. 
    It is not the general policy of the city to extend public sewers at city expense. The city may, when it is deemed to be in the best interests of the city and its inhabitants, participate in such sewer main extensions that are in excess of the minimum of eight inches in diameter. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.020 - On approved dedicated property. 
    No extension of a public sewer main shall be made except in an approved dedicated street, alley or recorded easement. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.030 - Industrial areas. 
    For "industrial areas" the extensions of public sewers shall be on an individual basis, at their own expense, since the size of sewer mains is dependent upon individual specific needs. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.040 - Maximum length. 
    The maximum length of the public sewer main extension which the applicant shall be required to install shall not exceed the distance from the location of service to the nearest public sewer main of adequate capacity. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.050 - Size. 
    The size of the sewer main extension shall be based on the requirements to meet the service demands for that extension. Eight-inch mains shall be the minimum size considered for general use. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.060 - Right-of-way. 
    If right-of-way is needed for the sewer main extension, the person desiring the extension shall obtain the right-of-way, or pay the cost to the city for acquiring such right-of-way. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.070 - Pump station.

    The person who has financed a sewer main extension may enter into an agreement with the city under the terms of which the city will reimburse him for that portion of the cost of the sewer main extension over and above the cost applicable to his premises. The source of funds for such reimbursement shall be the "special sewer fees" collected from other users of the "special sewer main" and payable within ninety days following the date of collection. Such agreement shall terminate within ten years from the date of execution of the agreement and the costs reimbursed shall not exceed the person's actual contribution toward the cost of sewer main extension. 
(Ord. 913 (part), 1991). 
13.32.110 - Procedure for extension due to location of premises or capacity of available sewer. 
    Whenever an extension of a public sewer is necessary or required because the principal part of the premises to be served does not lie along an existing public sewer or along a public sewer with adequate capacity, the extension will be installed under the following procedures: 
    The applicant shall make a request in writing to the engineer for preliminary investigation into the feasibility for such extension. If the extension as requested is found to be feasible, the engineer shall inform the applicant of the feasibility along with recommendations, conditions and alternatives for installation as follows: 
A.  Applicant may cause the public sewer main to be extended and enter into an agreement with the city for reimbursement as outlined in Section 13.32.100; 
B.  Applicant may enter into an agreement with the city and deposit therewith the estimated cost of construction, engineering, inspection and administration. The city will then cause the extension to be installed; 
C.  Applicant may cause the public sewer main to be extended and the city may participate in the oversized mains (those greater than eight inches in diameter) to serve future development along the public sewer main extension and/or areas beyond such extension, by allowing "construction credits" at a lineal foot cost. The construction credit shall be the difference in actual cost between minimum eight-inch pipe and the size of pipe installed plus a percentage of the installation costs, all to be determined by the engineer upon submittal of a copy of the successful bidder's bid.

(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.120 - Application exceeding capacity of system. 
    In the event of demands upon the sewerage system by several applicants which in the aggregate exceed the surplus capacity of such sewerage system, the engineer shall prorate among the several applicants the available carrying and treatment capacity upon an equitable basis, taking into consideration the total amount of industrial wastes of each applicant and the character and quantity of such wastes. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.130 - Inspection manhole and other observation and sampling equipment-Piping arrangement. 
    When required by the engineer, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable inspection manhole together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. The piping to and from the manhole or sampling compartment shall be arrayed so that observations may be made of all of the industrial liquid waste flow prior to admixture with domestic sewage and so that the industrial liquid waste flow may be plugged off without impeding the flow of domestic sewage. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the engineer. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.140 - Determination of measurements and tests-Procedure. 
    All measurements, tests, and analysis of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter and Chapters 13.12 through 13.40 shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at the inspection manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the inspection manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the inspection manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. (The particular analysis involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, B.O.D. and suspended solids analysis are obtained from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from period grab samples.) 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.150 - Installation of measuring device. 
    The engineer may require the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit has been issued to install a measuring device at that person's expense, so that the measurement of the flow may be made. If there is a possibility of the industrial liquid waste consisting of low pH acid waste or high pH basic waste, the engineer may require the installation of pH recording equipment at that person's expense, and if such recording equipment is required and installed, the record shall be submitted to the engineer. The engineer may require a person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit is issued to provide, at his own expense, for inspection of the quality of the industrial liquid waste or performance of industrial liquid waste pretreatment facilities by an impartial third party, which party shall meet the approval of the engineer. Such third party shall furnish to the engineer a signed copy of such report. The engineer may require a person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit is issued to report to him from time to time the nature and amount of materials processed by the industry and such other information as the engineer may find necessary to evaluate the effect of industrial liquid waste on the public sewer. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.160 - Industrial wastes discharged separately from sanitary sewage. 
    Whenever an applicant seeks a permit for a connection which will principally discharge industrial wastes, the engineer may as a condition to granting such permit require that industrial wastes be discharged separately from sanitary sewage into a manhole on the main line. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.170 - Alterations in equipment-Request for permit. 
    If a person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit is issued desires to make any alterations in his pretreatment facilities or alteration of connections to the sewer, or if such person desires to discharge additional industrial liquid waste into a main line sewer in excess of the amount previously authorized or desires to discharge into a main line sewer industrial liquid waste of a different kind or character than previously authorized, he shall file an application for such a change with the engineer, and request that a new permit be issued. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006).

C.  Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. Users discharging nondomestic wastewater into the POTW shall provide protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited wastes. Prior to the commencement of any nondomestic discharge and at least once every two years, the city shall evaluate whether each significant user requires an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for any user. Each plan shall include the following as a minimum: 
1.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
2.  Description of stored chemicals; 
3.  Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by this chapter; 
4.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, measures and equipment for emergency response and any other procedures deemed necessary to prevent accidental slug discharges from entering the POTW. 
D.  Additional Pretreatment Measures. 
1.  Whenever deemed necessary, the city may require user to restrict their discharge during peak-flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when deemed necessary by the city for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand. Such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the city and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning an inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at the user's expense. 
3.  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006).

The applicant for a wastewater permit shall furnish all information required by the engineer and/or inspector. The inspector, if he deems it necessary, may require plans of the proposed plumbing connection, interceptor and other appurtenances. If the applicant complies with all regulations and ordinances of the city, the engineer and/or inspector may issue a revocable permit to the applicant. Conditions and/or restrictions may be added to the permit as deemed necessary by the engineer and/or inspector in order that the public sewer may serve its intended purpose. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.260 - Interceptors. 
    The engineer may require that wastewater discharged into a public sewer be routed through an interceptor, which interceptor shall be constructed and maintained by the person to whom a wastewater permit is issued. The design of such interceptor shall meet with the approval of the engineer. The interceptor shall at all reasonable times be available and accessible to the engineer or other persons authorized by law to make such inspections. The piping to and from any interceptor shall be arranged so that wastewater will flow through the interceptor prior to a mixture with domestic sewage and so that wastewater flow may be plugged off without impeding the flow of domestic sewage. If an interceptor is required, the person to whom a wastewater disposal permit is issued shall provide an interceptor of sufficient size and capacity so that wastewater will be detained in the interceptor for at least one-half hour at maximum flow. The interceptor shall be water-tight and structurally sound and durable. It shall be easily accessible for cleaning by permittee and for inspection by the engineer and/or inspector or other authorized personnel. The failure of a person to keep the interceptor in proper working condition shall constitute grounds for termination of the revocable permit and the capping or plugging of the wastewater connecting sewer. An interceptor shall not be considered as properly maintained if sand and oil accumulations total more than twenty-five percent of the operating fluid capacity. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.270 - Manholes or sampling compartments. 
    The engineer and/or inspector may require that all wastewater discharged into a public sewer maintained by the city be routed through a manhole or sampling compartment which shall be constructed and maintained by the person to whom a wastewater permit is issued. The design of such manhole or sampling compartment shall meet with the approval of the engineer. The manhole or sampling compartment shall be available and accessible at all times to the engineer and/or inspector or other persons authorized by law to make such inspections. The piping to and from the manhole or sampling compartment shall be arranged so that observations may be made of all of the wastewater flow prior to admixture with domestic sewage and so that the wastewater flow may be plugged off without impeding the flow of domestic sewage.

(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.310 - Application to discharge additional wastewater. 
    If a person to whom a wastewater disposal permit has been issued desires to discharge additional wastewater into a main line sewer in excess of the amount previously authorized, he shall file an application and request the engineer and/or inspector to issue a new permit. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.320 - Failure to comply with permit provisions-Action. 
    If the engineer and/or inspector finds that the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit or a wastewater disposal permit has been issued has not complied with the provisions of the permit, or has failed to comply with the provisions of this chapter or Chapters 13.12 through 13.40 of this title, or other applicable ordinances or statutes governing the discharge of industrial liquid waste or wastewater into a main line sewer, or such person supplied false or misleading information in his application or if the discharge of industrial liquid waste or wastewater into a main line sewer causes a nuisance in the operation of a main line sewer, the engineer or inspector may give such person a ten-day notice, in writing, specifying the manner in which such person has failed to comply with the provisions of the permit, or the manner in which the discharge constitutes an unreasonable burden in the operation of a main line sewer. If such person within the time specified in the notice does not remedy the condition, or conditions, specified in the notice, the engineer may revoke the permit and cause to be capped the industrial liquid waste outlet or the wastewater outlet so that industrial liquid waste or wastewater disposal will not be discharged into a main line sewer. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.330 - Determination sewer is insufficient after permit issuance-Action. 
    If, after an industrial liquid waste disposal permit or a wastewater disposal permit has been issued, the engineer ascertains that the capacity of the main line sewer into which industrial liquid waste or wastewater is discharged is insufficient to handle the sewage sought to be discharged into such main line sewer, the engineer may, after the delivery of at least a ten-day notice, in writing, to the person to whom such industrial liquid waste disposal permit or wastewater disposal permit has been issued, either: 
A.  Cancel the permit previously issued authorizing the discharge of industrial liquid waste or wastewater into a main line sewer; 
B.  Modify any such permit by reducing the amount of industrial liquid waste or wastewater which may be discharged into a main line sewer; or 
C.  Limit the period of time during which industrial liquid waste or wastewater may be discharged into a main line sewer. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.340 - Increased costs due to permitted discharge increase-Payment by permittee. 
    If the discharge of industrial liquid waste or wastewater into a main line sewer pursuant to a permit issued by the engineer results in increased sewer maintenance costs to the city, the person to whom an industrial liquid waste permit or a wastewater disposal permit has been issued, shall reimburse the city for any increase in maintenance costs resulting from such discharge. If the engineer ascertains that increased maintenance costs have resulted from the discharge of industrial liquid waste or wastewater into a main line sewer, the engineer shall prepare and deliver to the person to whom the industrial liquid waste disposal permit or wastewater disposal permit has been issued, a statement of such increased maintenance cost and such person shall pay the sum to the engineer within fifteen days after the presentation of such statement. Fee schedule for COD surcharge is listed in Section 13.44.440 of this chapter. Till such time as fee schedules for other pollutants are added on to Section 13.44.440 of this chapter, fee surcharges for other pollutants shall be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis. Users will also be subject to costs incurred due to inspection, monitoring, sampling and analysis as stated under Section 13.44.470 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.350 - Right of entry. 
    The engineer and other duly authorized employees of the city bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all wastewater facilities of all properties served by the city for purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing, inspection and copying of records or documents, or any other duty in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.360 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  Users who propose to discharge, or who in the judgment of the city could discharge now or in the future, wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that produced by a dwelling unit may be required to install a monitoring facility. 
B.  When more than one user can discharge into a common building sewer, the city may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each use. When, in the judgment of the city there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the city may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. 
C.  Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of wastewaters produced by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the city, it shall be provided, installed, and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside of the building. The city may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the city and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
D.  If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for city personnel, such as a gate secured with a city lock. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and the sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at the expense of the user. 
E.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications. When, in the judgment of the city, an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be complete within ninety days following written notification unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.370 - Inspection and sampling. 
    The city may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative's ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection or sampling or in the performance of any of their duties. The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city will be permitted at any time to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
A.  Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards or required in the permit. At the direction of the director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
B.  Monthly monitoring reports submitted to the director for the purpose of collecting wastewater user fees must be submitted no later than the seventh day of the month following that report. 
C.  The director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection A of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of samples, an analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. 
D.  Significant users shall meet the requirements of the General Pretreatment Regulations for sampling and analysis. Other users shall meet the requirements for sampling and analysis as stated herein or in the user's control document. For all users, containers, preservation techniques, and holding times for samples shall comply with methods and procedures found at Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 136. For all users, sample analysis shall be in accordance with approved test procedures. The city, at its discretion, may specify which approved test procedure shall be used. Type of samples (grab or composite) and flow measurement shall be consistent with the type of discharge and parameters being regulated and shall be specified by the city in the permit. 
E.  Users shall provide a control point for the purpose of sampling and flow measurement. The location and design of the control point shall be approved by the city. The control point shall be placed so that nondomestic sewage can be sampled and measured prior to any commingling with domestic sewage or nonprocess flows. Written approval of exceptions to this requirement shall be obtained by a user from the city. It is recommended that the control point for sampling and flow measurement be at the same location. Flow may be determined by water supply meter measurements if no other flow device is available and no other source of raw water is used. Other methods for estimating wastewater discharge flow must approved by the city. 
F.  The city may select an independent contractor to conduct the independent monitoring by the city. 
(Ord. 1153 §5 (Att. C (part)), 2006). 
13.44.380 - Data collection. 
A.  Measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, C.O.D., B.O.D., T.O.C., grease and suspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial wastewater treatment charges and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary by the engineer may be required of each discharger. All sampling analyses and flow measurements of industrial wastewater shall be performed by a state certified independent laboratory, by a laboratory of the industrial discharger approved by the engineer, or by personnel of the city. If performed by the city's personnel, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the discharger requesting the test.

a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was being operated properly and in compliance with applicable and appropriate operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the city within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset: 
i.  A description of the nature of the discharge and cause of the noncompliance, 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including the exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue, 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance; 
d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
e.  Users will have the opportunity for judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards; 
f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment requirements upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power for the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
B.  Bypass. 
1.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
2.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. 
3.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it is also for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
4.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. A user shall submit oral notice to the city of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if proper oral notice has been given. 
5.  Bypass is prohibited, and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.

iii.  The total estimated or measured nondomestic discharge as determined by methods specified in the user's permit. 
    8.34 - conversion factor for units of measure in surcharge equations. 
    B - cost per pound of COD. 
    Fees may be set by resolution of the city council COD - COD concentration in mg/l. For more than one nondomestic discharge, this shall be the flow-weighted concentration. 
    450 - normal daily average COD in mg/l. 
3.  Sampling and Analysis. The city shall sample for BOD, TSS, and COD and any other pollutant or parameter of interest. The time of sampling shall be at the sole discretion of the city. The city may select an independent contractor to conduct the sampling and/or analyses. 
4.  Period of Surcharge. If analyses for or COD shows that a surcharge is applicable, the surcharge shall be retroactive for two monthly billing periods and shall continue for four monthly billing periods. 
5.  Costs of Analyses. When analyses show that a surcharge shall be applied, a fee shall be added to a user's bill to cover the sampling, handling, and laboratory analyses. When analyses show that a surcharge shall not be applied, then this fee shall not be added to the user's bill. The city may bill the user for the cost of sampling, handling, and laboratory analyses.

Chapter 13.52 - RECYCLING AND DIVERSION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION (C&D) WASTE 
Sections: 

13.52.010 - Statement of policy. 
A.  Under California law as embodied in the California Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code Sections 40000 et seq.), the City of Delano is required to prepare, adopt and implement source reduction and recycling plans to reach landfill diversion goals, and is required to make substantial reductions in the volume of waste materials going to the landfills, or face fines up to ten thousand dollars per day. In order to meet these goals, it is necessary that the city promote the reduction of solid waste, and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills. 
B.  Waste from construction, demolition, and renovation of buildings represents a significant portion of the volume of waste presently coming from the City of Delano and much of this waste is particularly suitable for recycling and reuse. 
C.  The city's commitment to the reduction of waste requires the establishment of programs for recycling and salvaging of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.020 - Definitions. 
    Definitions used in this chapter shall conform to Section 13.48.020 of the Delano Municipal Code and the following: 
    "Waste management plan compliance official" means the city manager or a designee of the city manager. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.030 - Diversion requirement. 
    It is required that at least fifty percent of waste tonnage from construction, demolition, and renovation waste shall be diverted from disposal in landfills or similar facilities. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.040 - Diversion requirement exemption. 
A.  Application. If an applicant for a covered project experiences circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for a diversion requirement exemption at the time that he or she submits the waste management plan (WMP) required under Section 13.52.060. 
B.  Granting of Exemption. If the WMP compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirements, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for waste generated by the project and shall indicate the new diversion requirement the applicant shall be required to meet, and will inform the applicant in writing of the new requirement. The applicant shall then have thirty calendar days to resubmit another WMP, which is in compliance with the new diversion requirement. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.050 - Thresholds for covered projects. 
A.  Covered Projects (Construction and Renovation). All construction and renovation projects within the city that are two hundred square feet or greater shall comply with this chapter, shall submit a waste management plan prior to beginning any construction or demolition activities, and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this chapter shall subject the project applicant to the full range of enforcement mechanisms set forth in Section 13.52.100 (Fines/penalties) of this chapter. 
B.  Covered Projects (Demolition). All demolition projects within the city that are seventy-five square feet or greater shall comply with this chapter, shall submit a waste management plan prior to beginning any demolition activities, and shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.

E.  Deconstruction/Recovery Interval for Covered Demolition Projects. Every covered demolition project shall be made available for deconstruction, salvage, and recovery prior to demolition. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to recover the maximum feasible amount of designated recyclable and reusable materials prior to demolition. In order to provide sufficient time for deconstruction, salvage, and recovery, no demolition may take place until a period of ten working days has elapsed from the date of issuance of the demolition permit. Recovered and salvaged designated recyclable and reusable material from every project shall qualify to be counted in meeting diversion requirements of Section 13.52.030 (Diversion requirement). Recovered or salvaged designated recyclables and reusable materials may be given away or sold on the premises, or may be removed to reuse facilities for storage or sale.

5.  Projects where no structural building modifications are required; 
6.  Emergency demolition required to protect public health and safety. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.060 - Waste management plan. 
A.  Prior to starting the project, every applicant shall submit a properly completed "waste management plan" (WMP) to the WMP compliance official, in a form as prescribed by that official, as a portion of the building or demolition permit process. The completed WMP shall contain the following: 
1.  The estimated volume or weight of project waste to be generated by material type; 
2.  The maximum volume or weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling by material type; 
3.  The vendor(s) that the applicant proposes to use to haul the materials; 
4.  Facility(s) the materials will be hauled to, and their expected diversion rates by material type; 
5.  Estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition waste that will be disposed. 
    In estimating the volume or weight of materials as identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the City of Delano for this purpose. Approval of the WMP as complete and accurate shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any building or demolition permit. If the applicant calculates the projected feasible diversion rate as described above, and finds the rate does not meet the diversion goal, the applicant must then submit information supporting the lower diversion rate. 
B.  Approval. No building or demolition permit shall be issued for any covered project unless and until the WMP compliance official has approved the WMP. Approval shall not be required, however, where emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety. The WMP compliance official shall only approve a WMP if he or she determines that all of the following conditions have been met: 
1.  The WMP provides all of the information set forth in this section; 
2.  The WMP indicates that fifty percent of all C&D waste generated by the project shall be diverted (or new diversion goal set in accordance with the applicant's approved diversion exemption request); and

C.  Use of Contractors. The applicant for a project may submit a WMP and provide disposal using vehicles and forces in the direct employ of the applicant, or the applicant shall use the services of a contractor with a franchise for roll-off containers licensed by the City of Delano and in accordance with Section 13.48.220 of the Delano Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.070 - Deposit required. 
    As a condition precedent to the issuance of any permit for construction or demolition for a covered project, the applicant shall post a deposit (cash, letter of credit, performance or surety bond, money order) in the amount set by a resolution of the city council. The deposit shall be returned, without interest, in total or prorated, upon proof of satisfaction by the WMP compliance official that no less than the required percentage of construction and demolition waste tonnage generated by the covered project has been diverted from disposal and has been recycled or reused or stored for later reuse or recycling. If a lesser percentage of construction and demolition waste tonnage than required is diverted, a proportionate share of the deposit shall be returned. The deposit shall be forfeited entirely or to the prorated extent that there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The city may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required deposit. 
(Ord. 1139 §1(part), 2006). 
13.52.080 - On-site practices. 
    During the term of the covered project, the applicant shall recycle and reuse the required percentage of waste, and keep records of the tonnage or other measurements approved by the City of Delano that can be converted to tonnage amounts.

    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, this chapter and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.) 
    "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the area within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in accordance with sound engineering standards. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway" or "designated floodway." 
    "Floodway encroachment lines" means the lines marking the limits of floodways on federal, state and local floodplain maps. 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the designated floodway where encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 14.60.320 through Section 14.60.380 regarding variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council of the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Habitable floor" is any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, recreation or a combination thereof. For floodplain management regulation purposes, "habitable floor" and "lowest floor" will share the same definition. 
    "Hardship" as related to Section 14.60.320 through Section 14.60.380 regarding variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council of the city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Landfill" means a permitted location for the disposal, placement, or dumping of garbage, trash, debris, junk, or waste material. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in Subsection 14.60.260(D); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 14.60.240; 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 14.60.250; and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 14.60.270. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
    "Nonresidential building" means and includes, but is not limited to, small business concerns, churches, schools, nursing homes, farm buildings (including grain bins and silos), government buildings, mercantile structures, industrial plants and warehouses. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year Flood. See "Base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 14.60.320 through Section 14.60.380, regarding variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Person" includes any individual or his agent, firm or group of individuals, partnership, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or any other entity including the state or its agencies or political subdivisions. 
    "Principal structure" means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and

    For floodplain management purposes, the term "recreational vehicle" also includes, but is not limited to, park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Scour depth" means the distance below prevailing ground resulting from the erosive action of running water which temporarily or permanently excavates and carries away material from the prevailing ground or channel bed during flooding. 
    Sheet Flow Area. See "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
    "Start of construction" means and includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    "Structure" means a roofed building, with one or more walls, that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure by reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvements to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development or improvement of a structure, the cumulative replacement cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the initial improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

C.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
D.  Within zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.260 - Elevations and floodproofing. 
A.  Except for areas of shallow flooding, new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development of any structure in a special flood hazard area shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation. Nonresidential structures may meet the standards in Subsection 14.60.260C. Qualifying uninhabitable attached garages or storage rooms and accessory structures (such as a shed or detached garage) may meet the requirements of Subsection 14.60.260E. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered professional engineer, architect or licensed surveyor, or verified by the building official to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
B.  For areas of shallow flooding, new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development of any structure in a special flood hazard area shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one foot above the shallow flooding depth or depth number specified in feet on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or at least two feet if no depth number is specified.

E.  For an uninhabitable attached garage or storage facility on a residential structure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement, or for accessory structures (such as a shed or detached garage), not representing a significant investment as determined by the floodplain administrator in exercise of his reasonable discretion, may be allowed to have the finished floor of the attached garage, storage room or accessory structure built below the base flood elevation without floodproofing, provided that conditions shall be imposed relating to the construction and use of such accessory structure, as follows: 
1.  Such structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement which may result in damage to other property. 
2.  Such structure shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. 
3.  Such structure shall be constructed with utilities, if any (e.g., electrical plumbing, etc.), resistant to flood damage. Utilities, if any, should be elevated or floodproofed. 
4.  Such structure shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. The structure should be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters. 
5.  The structure shall not be used for human habitation, including but not limited to, placement of laundry facilities, workshops, or other similar uses. 
F.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 14.60.290. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.270 - Standards for utilities. 
A.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Other utilities are addressed at Sections 14.60.250 and 14.60.280. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.280 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood and elevation of the base flood consistent with this chapter. 
B.  All final subdivision plans will provide the elevations of proposed structure(s), and grading for pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevations, the final pad elevation shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and the certification provided to the floodplain administrator. 
C.  All subdivision proposals: 
1.  Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; and 
2.  Have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage; and 
3.  Provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.290 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within a special flood hazard area either outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood shall: 
1.  Be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top of the steel frame is one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement; or 
2.  If the manufactured home is to be placed on an earth pad, the finished pad elevation shall be one foot above the base flood elevation and the manufactured home must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision in a special flood hazard area that are not subject to the provisions of Subsection 14.60.290.A shall be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either: 
1.  The top of the steel frame, or the top of the finished pad when an earth pad is used to meet the elevation requirements, is one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.300 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within area of special flood hazard will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use - a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions, or 
3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 14.60.130 through Section 14.60.220 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 14.60.290. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.310 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 14.60.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If Subsection 14.60.310.A is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.320 - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. In general, a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.330 - Authority and conditions to grant variances. 
    The floodplain administrator is empowered to grant variances from the terms of one or more regulations in this chapter in the following cases: 
A.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size which is contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the regulatory flood elevation, providing that the procedures of Sections 14.60.130 through 14.60.310 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 14.60.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Subsections 14.60.330.A through C and 14.60.350.B are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
    Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection 14.60.350.A and the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain administrator may impose other reasonable conditions on any variance mentioned in this section as deemed necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.340 - Special definitions. 
    For the purpose of Sections 14.60.320 through 14.60.390, certain terms and words are defined as provided in this section: 
    "Applicant" means a person who has applied for a development permit or for approval of a subdivision map, parcel map or variance. 
    "Application" means an application for a variance under this section. 
    "City" means the City of Delano City Council. 
    "Clerk" means the City of Delano City Clerk. 
    "Fraud and victimization" means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the floodplain administrator will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the elevation requirement of Section 14.60.260 are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Hardship" means the hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The floodplain administrator requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as exceptional hardships. All of these problems can be resolved through other means, without granting a variance. This is so even if the alternative means are more expensive or complicated than building with a variance or if they require the property owner to put the parcel to a difference use than originally intended, or to build elsewhere. 
    "Minimum necessary" means the minimum necessary to afford relief to the applicant of a variance with a minimum deviation from the requirements of this chapter. In case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, for example, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
    "Public safety and nuisances" means the granting of a variance must not result in additional threats to public safety or create nuisances. This chapter is intended to help protect the health, safety, well-being and property of local citizens. This is a long-range community effort made up of a combination of approaches such as adequate drainage systems, warning and evacuation plans, and keeping new property above flood levels. These long-term goals can only be met if exceptions to the requirements of this chapter are kept to a bare minimum. 
    "Responsible authority" means the officer or body with the duty of issuing any permit or rendering any approval required under this chapter which is subject to the regulations as to which a variance is sought. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.350 - Grounds for granting variance. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
6.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
7.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
8.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
9.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
10.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  The applicant for a variance shall show at the hearing thereon and before granting a variance, the floodplain administrator shall find: 
1.  That there is a good and sufficient cause for variance. 
2.  That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 
3.  That the granting of such variance and any construction, improvement, development, or other action which may be undertaken under it will not: 
a.  Result in any increased flood heights, additional threats to the public safety, or extraordinary public expense; 
b.  Create a nuisance; 
c.  Cause fraud on or victimization of the public; or 
d.  Conflict with any other ordinance or regulation of the city. 
4.  That the extent of the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief, considering the flood hazard. 
C.  It is recognized that, under Section 16.6(a)(6) of the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, the city is required to make a biennial report, or as requested by the Federal Insurance Administrator, and report therein any variances which have been granted, and that said administrator is empowered to review the findings justifying the granting of variances, and that if said administrator determines that such variances show a patter inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management, said administrator may take action under Section 59.24(b) of said regulations to suspend eligibility of the city from the National Flood Insurance Program. 
D.  It is also recognized that, under Section 60.6(a) of said regulations, the issuance of a variance is only for purposes of application of the floodplain management regulations in this chapter, and that flood insurance rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance, and that construction of a structure below the regulatory flood elevation, or otherwise inconsistently with the objectives of sound floodplain management, may result in flood insurance premium rates on such structure beyond the means of its owner, which are not modified by the granting of a variance. 
E.  For the reasons mentioned in subsections C and D of this section, it shall be the policy of the city to give the provisions of this chapter a conservative construction and application, with the objective of avoiding, wherever feasible, the granting of any variance which would be inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management or which may result in rendering residents of the city ineligible for flood insurance or which might place flood insurance beyond the means of the owner of a structure constructed under such variance. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.360 - General provisions for variances. 
A.  If an application for a variance is filed before the responsible authority has acted on a related application for development permit, subdivision map, or parcel map, it shall not make a decision thereon nor issue such permit or approve such map until the floodplain administrator has made his determination with respect to the variance. By filing such application for variance, the applicant shall be deemed to have consented to extension of the time within which action is required to be taken on such application for permit or map for a period of at least thirty days from and after the date of the floodplain administrator's determination with respect to the variance. 
B.  An application for variance may be filed prior to the filing of an application for a development permit or submission of proposed subdivision map or parcel map, but in such case, the applicant for variance shall furnish with the application for variance such information as the floodplain administrator may deem sufficient, in his reasonable discretion, to permit him to fully understand the application for variance and its effect in the context of the proposed development or subdivision, including, but not confined to, environmental information. 
C.  If the floodplain administrator determines that insufficient information has been provided to comply with any rules adopted pursuant to subsection D of this section or to permit him to fully understand the application for variance and its effect in the context of the proposed development or subdivision (including, but not confined to, its environmental effect), he is empowered to make an order requiring the applicant to furnish such information and to delay or continue the hearing until a reasonable time after such information has been furnished. 
D.  The floodplain administrator may, from time to time, adopt reasonable rules relating to the information to be furnished by the applicant for a variance. 
(Ord. 1038 § 1(part), 1999). 
14.60.370 - Procedure for filing and processing application for variance.

2.  Such construction below the regulatory flood elevation increases risk to life and property; and 
3.  Any other relevant information prescribed by the floodplain administrator; and 
4.  A copy of such notice shall be maintained with the record of the variance action mentioned in subsection E of this section. 
5.  A copy of such notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Kern County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
E.  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions by the floodplain administrator or by the city in connection with any appeal to it relating to a variance. Such record shall include the findings or other justifications for issuance of each variance.

Title 15 - LAND DEVELOPMENT 
Chapters: 
Chapter 15.04 - AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE PROCEDURES 
Sections: 

15.04.010 - Intent and purpose. 
    The intent of this chapter is to authorize the City of Delano to designate suitable areas of the city as agricultural preserves by resolution of the city council pursuant to the Williamson Act of 1965 (Government Code Section 51200 et seq.) for the purpose of establishing agricultural and compatible land uses. 
(Ord. 1132 §1(part), 2005). 
15.04.020 - Administration. 
    Agricultural preserves shall be administered pursuant only to those portions of the Williamson Act of 1965 that apply to the preservation of agricultural lands, as now enacted or hereafter amended, and pursuant to the uniform rules, as defined under this chapter, which shall apply in all agricultural preserves now or hereafter established. Other aspects of the legislation, as defined by Section 51205 of the Government Code, can be included only if they are secondary to the primary agricultural use of the land.

The proposed alternate land uses are also contingent upon approval of the cancellation of the contract. Approval of the petition for cancellation, with proposed alternative land uses, shall be considered by the city council at a noticed public hearing. 
D.  Final approval of cancellation of the contract shall be conditioned upon finalization of the alternative land use (such as recordation of a tentative tract map) and the payment of a penalty fee. The penalty fee shall be twelve and one-half percent of the cancellation valuation of the property (assessment value of the land as though it was free of the contractual restriction). An additional penalty fee may be levied pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 51283.1 by resolution of the city council. 
E.  No contract shall be canceled until after the city council has given notice and has held a public hearing on the matter. Notice of the hearing shall be published pursuant to Section 6061 of the Government Code and shall be mailed to every owner under contract, any portion of which is situated within one mile of the exterior boundary of the land upon which the contract is proposed to be canceled. 
1.  Within thirty days of tentative cancellation of the contract, the city, as required by Government Code Section 51284, shall comply with the following: 
a.  Deliver a copy of the public notice of the decision (including findings made pursuant to Government Code Section 51282) to the director of the department of conservation; 
b.  Advertise in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the city, in a minimum display size of one-eighth of a newspaper page. 
F.  The city council may grant tentative approval for cancellation of a contract only after making one of the following findings: 
1.  That the cancellation is consistent with the purposes of the Williamson Act. Consistency with the Williamson Act is found only if the city council makes all of the following findings: 
a.  That the cancellation is for land on which a notice of nonrenewal has been served; 
b.  That cancellation is not likely to result in the removal of adjacent lands from agricultural use; 
c.  That cancellation is for an alternative use which is consistent with the applicable provisions of the city general plan; 
d.  That cancellation will not result in discontinuous patterns of urban development; 
e.  That there is no proximate noncontracted land which is available and suitable for proposed use of the contracted land, or, that development of the contracted land would provide more contiguous patterns of urban development than development of proximate noncontracted land. 
2.  Cancellation is in the Public Interest. The cancellation is determined to be in the public interest only if the city council makes the following findings: 
a.  That other public concerns substantially outweigh the objectives of the Williamson Act; and 
b.  That there is no proximate contracted land which is both available and suitable for the use to which it is proposed in contracted land to be put, or that development of the contracted land would provide more contiguous patterns of urban development than development of proximate noncontracted land. 
G.  Unless the penalty fee is paid, or a final certificate of cancellation is issued within one year from the date of the recording of the certificate of tentative cancellation, the penalty fee will be recomputed as of the date of the applicant's notice to the city council that all the conditions of the certificate of tentative cancellation have been satisfied. 
H.  The land conservation contract will stay in effect until all conditions of the certificate of tentative cancellation have been met and a final certificate of cancellation has been adopted by the city council and has been recorded with the Kern County Recorder's Office.

The completed application shall be submitted to the city council for public review. 
B.  The city council shall investigate the facts bearing on each case and shall verify information necessary to assure action consistent with the intent and purpose of this Code. 
C.  A person may not file and the community development director shall not accept an application which is the same as or substantially the same as an application upon which final action has been taken by the City of Delano within twelve months prior to the date of such application, unless accepted by a motion of the city council. 
(Ord. 1132 §1(part), 2005).

    Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city shall deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.30.090, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
    The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.30.090.C. 
(Ord. 1100 §1(part), 2003).

Such requirements will be satisfied by a combination of: (1) park land and park development dedications pursuant to this chapter; (2) usable open space, acceptable in accordance with Section 16.34.040. The adopted parkland and park development dedication standard shall reflect the ratio of parkland to residents, as set forth in California Government Code Section 66477. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.040 - Formula for determining land dedication. 
    Where a park or recreation facility has been designated in the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall dedicate land for a local park sufficient in size and topography that bears a reasonable relationship to serve the present and future needs of the residents of the subdivision. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following formula: 
    The formula for determining acreage to be dedicated shall be as follows: 
average no. of 
persons/unit ÷ 1,000 population = minimum acreage 
dedication 3  
Example for single-family dwelling unit (DU): 
4.21 ÷ 1,000 = .01264 acres/DU 3  
    The following table of population density has been established pursuant to Section 66477(b) of the Government Code: 
Park Land Dedication Formula Table 
Types of Dwellings Average Density/DU Acreage/DU (3 ac. Std.) Single-Family 4.21 .01264 Duplex, Low Density 3.49 .01048 Duplex, Med/High 3.40 .01021 Mobile Homes 3.73 .01120  
    Dedication of the land shall be made in accordance with the procedures contained in Section 16.34.110 of this chapter. 
    For the purpose of this section, the number of dwelling units shall be based upon the number of parcels indicated on the map when in an area zoned for one dwelling unit per parcel. When all or part of the subdivision is located in area zoned for more than one dwelling unit per parcel, the number of proposed dwelling units in the area so zoned shall equal the maximum allowed under that zone, including any applicable density increases. In the case of a condominium project, the number of new dwelling units shall be the number of condominium units. The term "new dwelling unit" does not include dwelling units lawfully in place prior to the date on which the parcel or final map is filed. 
    The land to be dedicated pursuant to this section shall be reviewed at the tentative map stage in accordance with the criteria set forth on Section 16.34.040 and approved by the community services director. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.050 - Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication. 
A.  General Formula. If there is no park or recreational facility designated in the City of Delano Park Master Plan, to be located in whole or in part within the proposed subdivision for the purpose of serving the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision, the developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to the value of the land prescribed for dedication in Section 16.34.030 of this chapter and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.34.070 of this chapter. 
B.  Fees in Lieu of Land; Fifty Parcels or Less. If the proposed subdivision contains fifty parcels or less, the subdivider shall pay a fee equal to the fair market value of the land or the portion of the local park required to serve the needs of residents of the proposed subdivision as prescribed in Section 16.34.080 of this chapter and in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.34.040 of this chapter. 
    However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in subdivisions of fifty parcels or less, where the subdivider proposes such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city council. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.060 - Criteria for requiring both land dedication and in-lieu fee. 
    In subdivisions of more than fifty parcels, the subdivider shall both dedicate land and pay a fee in accordance with the following formula: 
A.  When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed on the City of Delano Park Master Plan as the site for park purposes, such portion shall be dedicated for park purposes and a fee computed pursuant to the provision of this section shall be paid for the value of any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 16.34.070 of this chapter. 
B.  When a major part of the local park or recreation site has already been acquired by the city and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, such remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed pursuant to the provisions of Section 16.34.070 of this chapter shall be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land to be used for the improvements of the existing park and recreation facility or for the improvement of other local parks and recreation facilities in the area serving the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.070 - Amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. 
    When a fee is to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the value of the amount of such fee shall be based upon the fair market value of the amount of land which would otherwise be required for dedication pursuant to Section 16.34.050. The fee shall be determined by the following formula: 
Park Acreage Dedication: 
DUs × Pop × 3 acres × FMV = subtotal × 6/5= in-lieu 
fee DU 1,000 people buildable acre  
where 
DU's = Number of dwelling units as defined in Section 16.34.040. 
Pop = Population per dwelling unit. 
DU 
    Park acreage dedication standard, the adopted amount of park land and park development per one thousand residents that is required pursuant to this chapter, as determined by city council as set forth in Section 16.34.030. 
FMV = Fair market value determined by Section 16.34.080. 
Buildable acre =a typical acre of the subdivision, with a slope less than ten percent, and located in other than an area on which building is excluded because of flooding, easements, or other restrictions. 
    Fees to be collected pursuant to this section shall be reviewed by the community services director to ascertain if they comply with the formula set forth in this section. If compliance is found, then the fees shall be approved by the community services director. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.080 - Determination of fair market value. 
    The fair market value shall be determined by the city with a written appraisal report from the subdivider, prepared and signed by an appraiser acceptable to the city. The appraisal shall be made immediately prior to the filing of the final map. The subdivider shall notify the city of the expected filing date at least six weeks prior to filing of the final map. If more than one year elapses prior to filing the final map, the city will prepare a new appraisal and will bill the subdivider for the cost of the reappraisal. For the purposes of this chapter, the determination of the fair market value of a buildable acre, as defined in Section 16.34.070, shall consider, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
A.  Approval of and conditions of the tentative subdivision map; 
B.  The general plan; 
C.  Zoning; 
D.  Property location; 
E.  Site characteristics of the property. 
    If the subdivider objects to the determined fair market value, he/she may appeal to the city council who shall hear the appeal under the same rules and obligations current for local board of equalization hearings, except that the burden of proof shall lie with the subdivider. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.090 - Determination of land or fee. 
    Whether the city council body accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
A.  The natural features, topography, geology, access and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication; 
B.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication; 
C.  Feasibility of dedication; 
D.  Compatibility of dedication with the general plan; and 
E.  The location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways. 
    The determination of the city council as to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.100 - Credit for private open space. 
    No credit shall be given for private open space in the subdivision except as hereinafter provided. 
    Where private open space usable for active recreational purposes in a planned development, real estate development, stock cooperative, and community apartment project, as defined in Sections 11003, 11003.1, 11003.4 and 11004, respectively, of the Business and Professions Code, and condominiums, as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code, partial credit, not to exceed forty-five percent, shall be given against the requirement of the land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all the following standards are met: 
A.  Yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open space areas required by the zoning and building ordinances and regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
B.  Private park and recreation facilities shall be owned by a homes' association composed of all property owners in the subdivision and being and incorporated nonprofit organization capable of dissolution only by seventy-five percent affirmative vote of the membership and approved by the city, operated under recorded land agreements through which each lot owner in the neighborhood is automatically a member, and each lot is subject to a change for a proportionate share of expenses for maintaining the facilities; and 
C.  Use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreation purposes by recorded covenant which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; and 
D.  The proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location; and 
E.  Facilities proposed for the open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreation purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location; and 
F.  The open spaces, for which credit is given, is a minimum of three acres and provides all of the local park basic elements listed below, or a combination of such and other recreation improvements that will meet the specific recreation needs of future residents of the area: 
Elements Acres Children's play apparatus area .50 to .75 Landscape park-like with quiet areas .50 to 1.00 Family picnic area .25 to .50 Game court area .25 to .50 Turf playfield 1.00 to 3.00 Swimming pool (42' × 75') with adjacent deck lawn areas .25 to .50 Recreation center building .15 to .25  
    Before a credit is given, the city council shall make written findings that the standards set out in this section are met. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.110 - Procedure. 
    At the time of the approval of the tentative map, or tentative parcel map, rezoning, issuance of a building permit, or any other discretionary approval for development, the city council shall, pursuant to this chapter, require the dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof and the payment of fees for park development. 
    At the time of the filing of the final subdivision map or parcel map, the subdivider shall dedicate the land as required by the city council. Where the city council has determined that fees shall be paid in lieu of or in addition to the dedication of land, the city council shall set the in-lieu fees based on the land dedication requirements as established at the time of tentative map approval using current land values at the time of final map approval with the formula set forth in Section 16.34.070 and using the process of determining fair market value as set forth in Section 16.34.080. The subdivider shall pay such fees in accordance with the following schedule: 
A.  For any subdivision consisting of ten or more lots, fees shall be paid, in their entirety, prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any lot in the subdivision. 
B.  For any subdivision consisting of nine or less lots, fees shall be paid on a lot-by-lot basis prior to the issuance of any building permit for any building or structure to be located upon any one of the lots in the subdivision. 
    Open space covenants for private park or recreation facilities shall be submitted to the city prior to approval of the final subdivision map or parcel map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final subdivision map or parcel map. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.120 - Disposition of fees. 
    Fees determined pursuant to Section 16.34.070 shall be paid to the city engineering department and shall be deposited into the city park in-lieu (Quimby) fund, or its successor. Money in such fund, including accrued interest, shall be expended solely for acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of park land, or improvements related thereto. 
    Collected fees shall be appropriated by the city for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year within five years upon receipt of payment or within five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. 
    If such fees are not so committed, these fees, less an administrative charge, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bares to the total area of all lots in the subdivision. 
    The city finance director shall report to the city council at least annually on income, expenditures, and status of the subdivision city park Quimby Fund. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.130 - Exemptions. 
    Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter; provided, however, that a condition shall be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structure on one or more of the parcels, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit. 
    The provisions of this chapter do not apply to commercial or industrial subdivisions; nor do they apply to condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.140 - Developer-provided park and recreation improvements. 
    After the city council determines the land required for dedication and/or in-lieu fee payment by the developer, the developer may apply to the community services department for permission to construct specified park and recreation improvements on the land of the developer required for dedication or on land within the same city service area to be developed as a park. If the city council grants the developer permission for the construction of specified park and recreation improvements on the land, the city council shall fix the dollar value of the park and recreation improvements provided by the community services department. The dollar value of park and recreation improvements provided by the developer in the manner described in this chapter shall be credited against the fees required by this chapter. The city council reserves the right to approve such improvements prior to agreeing to accept the dedication of land and to require in-lieu fee payments should the land and improvements be unacceptable. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.150 - Schedule for use of land and/or fees. 
    The community services department shall develop a schedule specifying how, when and where it will use the land or fees, or both, to develop park and recreational facilities to serve residents of the subdivision. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.160 - Access. 
    All land offered for dedication to local park or recreational purposes shall have access to at least one existing or proposed public street. This requirement may be waived by the city council if the city council determines that public street access is unnecessary for the maintenance of the park area or use thereof by the residents. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.170 - Sale of dedicated land. 
    If during the ensuing times between dedication of land for park purposes and the commencement of first-stage development, circumstances arise which indicate that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational purposes serving the subdivision and the neighborhood (such as gift of park land or change in school location) by mutual agreement of the subdivider or owner and the city council, the land may be sold upon the approval of the city council with the resultant funds being used for the purchase of a more suitable site. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006). 
16.34.180 - Criteria for acceptance of public open space. 
    The city council may accept and maintain open space lands that promote public health, safety and welfare. 
    Such open space lands must provide substantial public use and one or more of the following: (1) contiguity to existing parks and open space areas; (2) major linkage between parks or open space areas; (3) a major off-street trail or pathway system which connects, or has the potential to connect, to other such trails; (4) valuable pedestrian experience on its own. Provisions of open space accepted pursuant to this section or protected by other techniques shall not be credited against the provision of park and recreational land or in-lieu fees as determined by this chapter, nor shall they in any way displace the need for provisions of adequate usable park space per this chapter. 
    Nothing in this section shall limit the offer of land dedication or donation and acceptance thereof by provisions outside this chapter. 
(Ord. 1144 §2(part), 2006).

(Ord. 1095 §5 (Exh. A (part)), 2003: Ord. 1094 §5 (Exh. A (part)), 2003). 
16.36.030 - Preparation-Recommendations. 
    If the preliminary soil report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, a soil investigation of each lot in the subdivision shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the State of California. The soil investigation shall recommend corrective action which is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling proposed to be constructed on the expansive soil. The report shall be filed with the director of public works. 
(Ord. 1095 §5 (Exh. A (part)), 2003: Ord. 1094 §5 (Exh. A (part)), 2003). 
16.36.040 - Approval. 
    The city engineer shall approve the soil investigation if it determines that the recommended corrective action is likely to prevent structural damage to each dwelling to be constructed on each lot in the subdivision. Appeal from such determination shall be to the city council. The building permit shall be conditioned upon the incorporation of the approved recommended corrective action in the construction of each dwelling.

20.2.50 - Conditional use permits. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. A conditional use permit is intended to control the establishment of those uses that have some special impact or uniqueness, such that their effect on the surrounding environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed for a particular location. The conditional use permit application provides for the review of the location and design of the proposed use, configuration of improvements, potential impact on the surrounding area from the proposed use, and the evaluation of the use based on fixed and established standards.

c.  The site is suitable for the type and intensity of use or development proposed; and 
d.  There are adequate provisions for water, sanitation, public utilities and services to ensure public health and safety; and 
e.  The proposed use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or materially injurious to properties and improvements in the vicinity; and 
f.  The proposed use would not result in a significant effect on the environment; unless overriding considerations outweigh the potential impacts. 
6.  Conditions of Approval. In granting a conditional use permit, the Planning Commission shall require that the use and development of the property conform with the site plan, architectural drawings, statements submitted in support of the application, and with such modifications thereof as may be deemed necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare and to secure the objectives of the General Plan. The Planning Commission may also impose such other conditions as may be deemed necessary to achieve these purposes, including, but not limited to the following matters:

7.  Acceptance of Conditions. A conditional use permit shall not become effective for any purpose unless an "Acceptance of Conditions" form has been signed by the applicant. 
A conditional use permit may be recorded against the property.

a.  That strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship not otherwise shared by others within the surrounding area or vicinity; and 
b.  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties in the vicinity and under the same zoning classification; and 
c.  That the strict interpretation and enforcement of the specified regulation would deprive the applicant of privileges enjoyed by the owners of other properties in the vicinity and under the same zoning classification; and 
d.  That the granting of the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and under the same zoning classification; and 
e.  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare, or materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity; and 
f.  That the granting of the variance is consistent with the objectives and policies of the General Plan and the intent of this Title. 
6.  Conditions. Conditions of approval for a variance may include, but shall not be limited to: 
a.  Requirements for open spaces, fences, wall, landscaping screening buffers, erosion control measures, and flood control measures including maintenance thereof;

(Ord. No. 2011-1241, § 1(Exh. A), 12-19-2011; Ord. No. 2017-1294, § 1(Exh. 2), 11-20-2017) 
20.2.70 - Development agreements. 
    Development agreements may be entered into and implemented by the City pursuant to the following procedures: 
1.  Purpose. 
a.  The Legislature of the State of California adopted Section 65864 et seq. of the Government Code, authorizing local governments to enter into development agreements with applicants for development projects. Under appropriate circumstances, development agreements will strengthen the public planning process, encourage private participation in comprehensive planning by providing a greater degree of certainty in that process, reduce the economic costs of development, allow for the orderly planning of public improvements and services and the allocation of costs therefore in order to achieve the maximum utilization of public and private resources in the development process, and assure, to the extent feasible, that appropriate measures to enhance and protect the environment of the City are achieved. 
b.  The objective of such an agreement is to provide assurances that, upon approval of the project, the applicant may proceed with the project in accord with existing policies, rules and regulations, subject to the conditions of approval, thus vesting certain development rights in the property. Development agreements will also ensure that all conditions of approval, including the construction of off-site improvements made necessary by such land developments, will proceed in an orderly and economical fashion to the benefit of the City. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish procedures and requirements for consideration of development agreements by the City consistent with State law. 
2.  Application Requirements and Forms. 
a.  An applicant may propose that the City consider entering into a development agreement pursuant to Article 2.5, Title 7 of the California Government Code commencing with Section 65864, by filing an application with the Community Development Department and demonstrate that the project satisfies the eligibility requirements of this Section. The form of said application shall be provided by the Community Development Director. 
b.  Applicant. An application may be filed only by the property owner or other person having a legal or equitable interest in the property that is the subject of the development agreement or by that person's authorized agent. The term "applicant" shall also include any successor in interest to the property owner, or successor in interest to any other person having a legal or equitable interest in the property. 
c.  Eligibility Requirements. The City Council finds that it may be in the City's best interest to enter into a development agreement when construction of the project will be phased over a several year period, is a large-scale development, shall occupy substantial acreage, or in some other way requires long-term certainty on the part of the developer and the City. The City Council reserves the sole right to determine whether a development agreement is appropriate and in the best interest of the City for a specific development project. 
3.  Proposed Development Agreement. 
a.  Each application shall be accompanied by a list of proposed conditions for a development agreement, which shall specify the duration of the agreement, the permitted uses of the property, the density and intensity of use, the maximum height and size of proposed buildings, and provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes. 
b.  A proposed development agreement may include conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions, provided that such conditions, terms, restrictions and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions shall not unreasonably prevent development of the land for the uses and to the density or intensity of the development set forth in the agreement. A proposed development agreement may also provide that construction shall be commenced within a specified time, and that the project or any phases thereof be completed within a specified time. 
c.  A program and standards for periodic review of the development agreement shall be included. 
d.  Appropriate provisions, acceptable to the City Attorney, providing security for the performance of the developer under the development agreement shall be included. 
e.  A development agreement shall include all conditions imposed by the City with respect to the development project, including those conditions required as a result of any environmental review prepared under the California Environmental Quality Act. Agreements for special purposes may be adopted covering only certain aspects of the project. Any such special purpose development agreement shall be identified as such. 
f.  All development agreements shall contain an indemnity and insurance clause, in form and substance acceptable to the City Attorney, requiring the developer to indemnify the City against claims arising out of the development process, provided that such a provision does not violate applicable law or constitute a joint venture, partnership or other participation in the business affairs of the developer by the City. 
g.  All development agreements, or any part of such development agreements, may be subject to subsequent condemnation proceedings by the City. 
h.  A proposed agreement may include such additional conditions, terms, restrictions or requirements as determined by the City Council to be in the public interest. 
4.  Parties to the Development Agreement. 
a.  Only a qualified applicant may file an application to enter into a development agreement with the City. The Community Development Director may require an applicant to submit proof of his interest in the real property and of the authority of the agent to act for the applicant. Such proof may include a preliminary title report issued by a title company licensed to do business in the State of California evidencing the requisite interest of the applicant in the real property. Before processing an application, the Community Development Director may obtain the opinion of the City Attorney as to the sufficiency of the applicant's interest in the real property to enter into a development agreement as a qualified applicant. 
b.  In addition to the City and the qualified applicant, any federal, State or local governmental agency or body may be included as a party to any development agreement. Any such additional party may be made a party to a development agreement pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act (Government Code 6500, et seq.) providing for joint powers agreements, or provisions of other applicable federal, State or local law, in order to create a legally binding agreement among such parties. 
5.  Review of Application. 
a.  The Community Development Director shall endorse the application on the date it is received. The application shall be reviewed and may be rejected if it is incomplete or inaccurate. If the application is complete, it will be accepted for filing. The Community Development Director shall review the application and determine any additional requirements necessary to complete the agreement form. After receiving the required information, a staff report and recommendation shall be prepared which will state whether or not the development agreement, as proposed or in an amended form (specifying the nature of the amendments), would be consistent with the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan, and with the provisions contained herein, and whether it meets the needs and requirements of the City. 
b.  The Community Development Director shall, as part of his review of the application, circulate copies of a proposed development agreement to those City departments and other agencies having jurisdiction over the development project to be undertaken pursuant to the development agreement, for review and comment by such City agencies. The proposed development agreement shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency and a proposed ordinance authorizing the City to enter into the development agreement, for action by the City Council upon hearing thereof as specified herein shall be prepared. The staff report and recommendation of the Community Development Director shall include any appropriate recommendations received by other agencies. 
c.  The Community Development Director shall, at the applicant's expense and in accord with City procedures for implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act, undertake environmental review and, upon completion of such review, transmit the application, together with a recommendation thereon, to the City Council. 
d.  Upon receipt of the application, the results of the environmental review, and the recommendations of the Community Development Director, the City Council shall schedule a public hearing. Notice of intention to consider the application shall be given as provided in Sections 65090 and 65091 of the California Government Code and as provided for in Section 20.2.150 of this Chapter. In addition, if the application is being processed together with the development project, notice of such intention shall be given as required for consideration of the development project. 
e.  Review Standard. The Planning Commission may recommend use of a development agreement as a method of implementing or providing standards and criteria for any development approval including but not limited to: 
(1)  A development approval pursuant to this Title; 
(2)  An amendment to the General Plan; 
(3)  The formation of an assessment district, benefit district, maintenance district, special benefit district, or any other mechanism for the installation of required on-site and/or off-site improvements; and/or

(6)  It will promote and encourage the development of the proposed project. 
6.  Hearing by City Council. 
a.  Adoption by Ordinance. A development agreement is a legislative act, and shall be enacted by ordinance only after a public hearing before the City Council is held pursuant to the procedures described herein. The ordinance shall refer to and incorporate by reference the text of the development agreement. 
b.  Conduct of Hearing. At the hearing, the City Council shall consider the Community Development Director's and Planning Commission's recommendation, together with any additional public testimony, and may approve, disapprove, or modify any recommendation of the Planning Commission or Community Development Director. 
c.  Consistency with the General Plan, and any Specific or Policy Plans. Before the City Council may approve a development agreement, it must find that its provisions are consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plans or policy plans of the City. If the City Council approves a development agreement in the form recommended by the Community Development Director, without further findings, it shall be deemed to have also adopted the findings of the Community Development Director. 
d.  Execution of a Development Agreement. If the City Council adopts an ordinance approving a development agreement, the parties thereto shall execute the development agreement within thirty calendar days after adoption of the ordinance; provided, however, that the development agreement shall not become effective until the ordinance authorizing the development agreement also becomes effective. The time for executing the agreement may be extended by the mutual consent of the City Council and the applicant. 
e.  Recordation. Within ten calendar days after the City enters into a development agreement, the City Clerk shall have the agreement recorded with the Kern County Recorder as required in Government Code Section 65868.5. If the parties to the agreement or their successors in interest amend or cancel the agreement as provided in Government Code Section 65868, or if the City determines or modifies the agreement as provided in Government Code Section 65865.1 for failure of the applicant to materially comply in good faith with the terms or conditions in the agreement, the City Clerk shall have notice of such action recorded with the Kern County Recorder. 
7.  Periodic Review. 
a.  The City shall periodically review a development agreement at least once every twelve months after the City enters into a development agreement. 
b.  Not less than forty-five, nor more than sixty calendar days prior to the yearly anniversary of the date a development agreement was entered into, the applicant shall submit evidence to the Community Development Director of the applicant's good faith compliance with the development agreement. Said notification shall be accompanied by a processing fee in such amount as may hereinafter be established by resolution of the City Council. 
c.  Finding of Compliance. If the Community Development Director finds good faith compliance by the developer with the terms of a development agreement, a certificate of compliance shall be issued, which shall be in recordable form and may be recorded by the developer in the official records. The issuance of a certificate of compliance by the Community Development Director and the expiration of the appeal period hereinafter specified without appeal, or the confirmation by the City Council of the issuance of the certificate on such appeal, shall conclude the review for the applicable period and such determination shall be final. 
d.  Finding of Noncompliance. If, based on substantial evidence, the Community Development Director finds the developer has not complied in good faith with the terms of a development agreement, the respects in which the developer has failed to comply shall be specified in writing. The Community Development Director shall also specify a reasonable time for the developer to meet the terms of compliance. If such areas of noncompliance are not corrected within the reasonable time limits as prescribed by the Community Development Director, the development agreement shall be subject to cancellation pursuant to provisions herein. 
e.  Appeal of Determination. Any interested person may file an appeal of the issuance of a certificate of compliance to the City Council within ten days after the certificate's issuance. The developer may also file an appeal to the City Council of a finding of noncompliance by the Community Development Director within ten days after giving notice of such determination. All appeals before the City Council shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of Section 20.2.180 of this Chapter at which time evidence shall be taken and findings thereon made. 
f.  Referral to the City Council. The Community Development Director may refer any review to be conducted hereunder to the City Council. Such referral shall be made together with a staff report of the Community Development Director's preliminary findings. Upon such referral, the City Council shall conduct a noticed public hearing to determine the good faith compliance by the developer with the terms of the development agreement in accordance with the provisions contained herein, and shall direct the issuance of a certificate of compliance upon a finding of good faith compliance, or make the determination of noncompliance on the basis of substantial evidence. 
8.  Cancellation or Modification. 
a.  Cancellation or Modification by Mutual Consent. Any development agreement may be canceled or modified by mutual consent of the parties, but only in the manner provided in California Government Code Section 65868. Any proposal to cancel or modify a development agreement shall be heard and determined in accordance with the same procedures specified by this Section for approval of a development agreement. 
b.  If, at any time during the term of a development agreement, the Community Development Director finds, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the developer has not complied in good faith with the terms and conditions of the development agreement, and such noncompliance has not been corrected, the City Council shall conduct a public hearing at which the developer must demonstrate good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. The burden of proof of substantial evidence of compliance by the developer is upon the developer. If such compliance cannot be shown, the City Council shall either commence proceedings to cancel the development agreement or recommend new terms and conditions intended to remedy the noncompliance. 
c.  The City Council shall conduct a noticed hearing, upon the recommendations of the Community Development Director, at which time the developer and any other interested persons shall be entitled to submit such evidence and testimony as may be germane to the issue of the developer's good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. If the City Council finds, based on substantial evidence, noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the development agreement, it may either cancel the development agreement upon giving 60 days notice to the developer or, in its discretion, may allow the development agreement to be continued by imposition of new terms and conditions intended to remedy such noncompliance. The City Council may impose such conditions to the action it takes as it considers necessary to protect the interest of the City. The decision of the City Council shall be final. 
d.  In the event that a development agreement should be canceled, or otherwise terminated, unless otherwise agreed all rights of the developer, property owner or successors in interests under the development agreement shall terminate. Any and all benefits, including money or land, received by the City shall be retained by the City. Notwithstanding the above provision, any termination of the development agreement shall not prevent the developer from completing and occupying a building or other improvements authorized pursuant to a valid building permit previously approved by the City or under construction at the time of termination, but the City may take any action permitted by law to prevent, stop, or correct any violation of law occurring during and after construction, and the developer or any tenant shall not occupy any portion of the project or any building not authorized by a previously issued building permit. As used herein, "construction" means work under a valid building permit, and "completing" means completion for beneficial occupancy for developer's use, or if a portion of the project is intended for use by a lessee or tenant, then for such portion. "Completion" means completion except for interior improvements such as partitions, duct and electrical runouts, floor coverings, wall coverings, lighting, furniture, trade fixtures, finished ceilings and other improvements typically constructed by or for tenants of similar buildings. At such time uses shall, to the extent possible, be deemed nonconforming uses, and shall be subject to the nonconforming use provisions of this Title. 
9.  Miscellaneous Provisions. 
a.  All development agreements shall be subject to the regulation and requirements of the laws of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; any codes, statutes, or executive mandates; and any court decision, State or Federal, thereunder. In the event that any such law, code, statue, mandate or decision made or enacted after a development agreement has been entered into prevents or precludes compliance with one or more provisions of the development agreement, such provisions of the development agreement shall be modified or suspended in the manner and pursuant to the procedures specified in the development agreement, as may be necessary to comply with such law, code, statute, mandate, or decision. 
b.  A development agreement entails and consists of a separate procedure from other land use planning procedures and shall not take the place of this Title, the General Plan, a conditional use permit, subdivision approval, building permit, or any other City development procedures. If so specified in a development agreement, it shall constitute an approval pursuant to such planning procedures as if separately enacted under other provisions of this Title or other City ordinances; to the extent practicable, public hearings on a proposed development agreement shall be held concurrent with the public hearings on all related land use approvals, and all such approvals shall be made concurrent with the approval of the development agreement. 
c.  When approved, a development agreement and any development control maps and all notations, references and regulations that are a part of the development agreement shall be part of the Development Agreement Ordinance. Development control maps include, but are not limited to, regulations intended to carry out any plan respecting location or type of activities; height, bulk, siding or design of structures; location or design of open areas; and landscaping and other comparable regulations. 
d.  This Section and any subsequent development agreement with respect to any development agreement enacted under this Chapter, any provision of such a development agreement that is in conflict with this Title shall be void. Unless otherwise provided by the development agreement, the City's rules, regulations and official policies governing permitted uses of land, governing density, and governing design, improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to development of the property subject to a development agreement shall be those City rules, regulations and official policies in force at the time of the approval of the development agreement by the City Council provided, however, that the developer is subject to all increases in City imposed fees, dedication requirements, and charges with respect to subsequent applications for development and construction within the property subject to a development agreement.

20.2.80 - Design review. 
1.  Purpose and Intent. 
a.  Reasonably ensure that construction of new buildings or structures and additions, renovations, conversions, and restorations to existing buildings or structures, including residential, institutional, commercial, and industrial development, (referred hereinafter in Section 20.2.80 of this Chapter as "development") does not have an adverse aesthetic, health, safety or architecturally related negative impact upon existing adjoining properties, or the City in general.

The Community Development Director may, at its discretion, refer any design review decision to the Planning Commission. 
5.  Design Criteria (Nonresidential). 
a.  The design and layout of a proposed development shall be consistent with the General Plan, the provisions of this Title, City Design Guidelines, and any adopted architectural criteria for specialized areas such as designated historic districts, theme areas, specific plans, or planned developments. 
b.  New, renovated, or remodeled development shall demonstrate that the following general design criteria have been integrated into the design and layout of the proposed development. 
(1)  Establish an architectural and siting design theme that is compatible with surrounding existing and planned development that includes the following elements: 
(a)  A relationship to prominent design features existing in the immediate area (i.e., trees, land form, key elements of adjacent development, etc.); 
(b)  A relationship to existing structures and neighborhood character. This includes prohibiting any device being or resembling security bars, gates, or other similar security devices from being placed over or on windows or doors on the exterior of any building, or the interior of any building if visible from a public street or public right-of-way; except for doors and windows on the ground level portion of the rear of a building facing an alley; 
(c)  A relationship to the natural environment (i.e., washes, native vegetation, and community landscaping). 
(2)  Design the development to create pleasing transitions to surrounding development by incorporating the following elements: 
(a)  The bulk of new structure(s) relates to the prevailing or planned scale of adjacent development; 
(b)  Setbacks from streets and adjacent properties relate to the scale of the structure and the function of the street and encourage pedestrian scale and uses; and 
(c)  Tall structures are made less imposing by physically stepping them back from the street. 
(3)  Respect the identified views and view corridors of existing developments to the greatest extent possible. Where applicable, view corridors oriented toward existing or proposed community amenities, such as parks, open space, or natural features, are to be enhanced. 
(4)  Create subtle variations in architectural and landscape components that provide visual interest, but do not create abrupt changes or cause discord in the overall character of the neighborhood. 
(5)  Provide appropriate transitions between different projects by providing buffer areas, landscaping, and other similar treatments (e.g., hedges, walls, fences, berms, or landscaped open space). 
(6)  Provide a harmonious appearance of the development with the surrounding environment and existing developments based on the compatibility of individual structures rather than one specific style of architecture. 
(7)  Avoid uninterrupted fences and walls, unless they are needed for specific screening, safety, or sound attenuation purpose. Where needed, fences or walls shall be required to: 
(a)  Relate to both the site being developed and surrounding developments, open spaces, streets, and pedestrian ways; 
(b)  Respect existing view corridors to the greatest extent possible; and 
(c)  Incorporate landscape elements or changes in materials, color, or texture in order to discourage graffiti, and prevent undue glare, heat, reflection, or aesthetic inconsistencies. 
(8)  Incorporate the following lighting concerns into development proposals: 
(a)  Lighting fixtures are to be attractively designed to complement the overall design theme of the project; 
(b)  Lighting shall create a festive atmosphere within commercial areas by outlining buildings, trees, or other architectural features to encourage nighttime use of those areas by pedestrians; and 
(c)  On-site lighting shall create a safe environment, adhering to established crime prevention standards, but shall not result in nuisance levels of light or glare on adjacent properties. 
(9)  Architectural plans for development shall be required to incorporate the following building elevation and screening criteria: 
(a)  All exterior wall elevations of buildings and screen walls shall have architectural treatments that enhance the appearance of the building or wall; 
(b)  Compatible materials and consistent style shall be evident within a development in all exterior elevations; and 
(c)  Within multifamily, commercial, office, and mixed use business park developments, trash enclosures, loading areas, mechanical equipment, and outdoor storage areas shall be screened from view from public streets, and from other public views, as appropriate. 
6.  Residential Subdivision Land Use Design Criteria. It is the intent of the General Plan and the provisions of this Title to encourage a variety of residential development types that are innovative in design and compatible with surrounding neighborhoods while being conducive to creating a balanced housing market in the City. The following represents components of design requirements for all residential subdivisions, except for the exemptions contained in Sections 20.2.80.6.e. (2) and (3): 
a.  Housing within new residential subdivisions should, where possible, be situated with recognizable variations in front and side yard building setbacks. 
b.  Residential developments should, where possible, maximize a feeling of openness by orienting road axes to open space areas and areas of visual interest. 
c.  The use of roof forms, including shed, gable, and hip roofs, alone or in combination shall be used to achieve a variety of roof lines for houses adjacent to public streets. All such roofs shall be of a concrete tile, approved shake, or an architectural style composition shingle with dimensional variations. All other proposed roofing materials shall be subject to review and approval by the City Building Official. 
d.  To reduce architectural massing at street corners and to create congruity where a two-story structure is next to a one-story structure, the incorporation of a one-story element into the two-story structure shall be required when feasible. 
e.  The minimum size for construction of a new house in the City shall be one thousand one hundred square feet. 
f.  All subdividers/developers shall be required to provide landscaping and an irrigation system for each lot of a residential subdivision prior to receiving a final inspection for any house constructed in that subdivision, as follows: 
(1)  Landscaping and an irrigation system for both the front yard and the street side yard, provided the street side yard is not obscured from sight from an adjacent street by fencing, of each lot shall be provided. Said landscaping shall consist of the following: (1) no less than one, fifteen-gallon-size tree; (2) ten percent of said yard area shall consist of a landscaped planter; and (3) the remaining portion of said yard area not occupied by a driveway, shall be improved with sod including one, six-station clock and two, one-inch valves. 
(2)  Any proposal for an alternative landscaping plan shall be subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director. 
g.  Architectural styles and themes should be compatible with the surrounding environment. However, to assure individuality among projects, each development shall vary its architectural design to avoid monotony and create interest, while remaining compatible with surrounding development. 
h.  If custom homes are not proposed, subdividers/developers of residential subdivision tracts shall provide a variety of floor plans and building elevations as depicted in Table 2.B, below.

20.2.85 - Residential density bonus and development incentives. 
1.  Purpose and intent. The specific purposes of the affordable housing density bonus and other incentives regulations are to: 
a.  Allow for density bonuses and additional incentives, consistent with Government Code Section 65915, for the production of affordable housing for lower and moderate income households, for seniors and disabled persons, and for development that includes a childcare facility; 
b.  Implement the policies of the general plan housing element to expand the provision of housing for lower and moderate income households, elderly residents and others with special housing needs; and 
c.  Establish requirements for resale and rental controls to ensure that units remain affordable for at least thirty years or such other term as required by the City, consistent with State law. 
2.  General provisions. 
a.  State Law Governs: The provisions of this article shall be governed by the requirements of Government Code Section 65915, as amended. Where conflict occurs between the provisions of this article and state law, the state law shall govern. 
b.  Land Use Compatibility: All affordable housing units shall be dispersed within market rate projects, whenever feasible. Affordable housing units within market rate projects shall be comparable with the design of market rate units in appearance, use of materials, and finished quality. Building forms, materials and proportions that are compatible with the character of the surroundings shall be used. 
c.  Availability: Affordable housing units shall be constructed concurrently with, and made available for qualified occupants at the same time as the market rate housing units within the same project unless both the City and the developer agree to an alternative schedule for development. 
d.  Effect of Granting Density Bonus: The granting of a density bonus shall not, in and of itself, require a general plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
e.  Income Levels: For purposes of determining income levels of households under this article, the City shall use the Kern County income limits in title 25, Section 6932 of the California Code of Regulations or other income limits adopted by the City council if the state department of housing and community development fails to provide timely updates of the income limits in the California Code of Regulations. 
3.  Application requirements. An application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, modification, or revised parking standard pursuant to this article shall be submitted in conjunction with the project application and shall be processed concurrently with all other applications that may be required for the project. The application shall be submitted on a form provided by the City and shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
a.  Site plan showing the total number of units, the number and location of the units dedicated pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(b), and the number and location of the proposed density bonus units; 
b.  The level of affordability of the dedicated units; 
c.  A description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards and evidence demonstrating that the application of the subject standard or requirement would preclude construction of the project at the densities provided for in California Government Code Section 65915 and that the waiver or modification is necessary to make development of the project financially feasible at the densities provided for in California Government Code Section 65915; 
d.  If a density bonus is requested for a land donation pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(g), the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that the requirements of Section 65915(g) have been met, thus entitling the project to the requested density bonus; and 
e.  If a density bonus is requested for construction of a childcare facility pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915(h), the application shall show the location and square footage of the proposed facility and provide evidence that the requirements of Section 65915(h) have been met, thus entitling the project to the requested density bonus. 
4.  Application review procedure. 
a.  Upon receipt of a complete application as outlined in Section 20.2.85.3 above, the request for a density bonus and/or development concession(s) shall be processed in conjunction with the appropriate project application(s). Upon acceptance of a complete application and a determination of project consistency with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the request shall be forwarded to the City of Delano Planning Commission to be considered at a noticed public hearing held in accordance with Section 20.2.140 of the Delano Municipal Code. 
b.  Following the public hearing held pursuant to Section 20.2.85.4.a. above, the Planning Commission shall adopt a resolution recommending to the City of Delano City Council approval, approval with conditions or denial the related application based on written findings, or the Planning Commission may continue such hearing in order to receive additional information prior to making a recommendation on the application. 
c.  Upon receipt of a recommendation from the Planning Commission on an application involving a request for a density bonus and/or development concession(s), the City Clerk shall schedule the matter for a noticed public hearing held in accordance with Section 20.2.140 of the Delano Municipal Code on the next available City Council agenda. The City Council shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the application based on written findings, or the City Council may continue such hearing in order to receive additional information prior to making a decision on the application.

b.  A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended in such a way as to occupy any part of the structure or site or another structure or site that it did not occupy at the time it became a nonconforming use, or in such a way as to displace any conforming use occupying a structure or site. 
c.  A nonconforming structure shall not be altered or reconstructed so as to increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards for front yard, side yard, rear yard, height of structures, distances between structures, or usable open space prescribed in the regulations for the zone district in which the structure is located. 
6.  Restoration of a Damaged Structure. 
a.  Whenever a nonconforming structure is destroyed to the extent of fifty percent or less by fire, calamity, or act of God, the structure may be restored and the nonconforming use may be resumed, provided that restoration is started within one hundred twenty calendar days and diligently pursued to completion. When the destruction exceeds fifty percent, or the structure is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations for the zone district in which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. 
b.  The extent of damage shall be based upon the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its condition prior to such damage to the estimated cost of duplicating the entire structure as it existed prior thereto. Estimates for this purpose shall be reviewed and approved by the Building Official and shall be based on the minimum cost of construction in compliance with the most currently adopted City Building Code. 
20.2.125 - Reasonable accommodation. 
A.  Purpose. In accordance with federal and state fair housing laws, it is the purpose of this section to provide reasonable accommodations in the city's zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices when needed to provide an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
B.  Review authority. The city manager or his/her designee, is hereby designated to approve, conditionally approve, or deny all applications for a reasonable accommodation. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then an applicant may request that the city manager hear the request for a reasonable accommodation at the same time as the other discretionary permit or approval. If the applicant does not request a simultaneous hearing, then the request for a reasonable accommodation shall not be heard until after a final administrative decision has been made regarding the other discretionary permit or approval. 
C.  Application for reasonable accommodation. 
1.  Applicant. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability. A reasonable accommodation may be approved only for the benefit of one or more individuals with a disability. 
2.  Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation from a zoning regulation, policy, or practice shall be made on a form provided by the community development department. No fee shall be required for a request for reasonable accommodation, but if the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits. 
3.  Other discretionary permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit. 
4.  Required submittals. In addition to materials required under other applicable provisions of this Code, an application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following: 
a.  Documentation that the applicant is: (i) an individual with a disability; (ii) applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability; or (iii) a developer or provider of housing for one or more individuals with a disability. 
b.  The specific exception or modification to the zoning code provision, policy, or practices requested by the applicant. 
c.  Documentation that the specific exception or modification requested by the applicant is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residence. 
d.  Any other information that the community development director reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether the findings required by Subsection B can be made, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individuals affected. 
D.  Decision. 
1.  City manager action. The city manager or his/her designee shall issue a written determination to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation, and the modification or revocation thereof in compliance with this section. The reasonable accommodation request shall be heard with, and subject to, the notice, review, approval, and appeal procedures prescribed for any other discretionary permit; provided that, notwithstanding Section 20.2.180, the standard of review on appeal shall not be de novo and the city council shall determine whether the findings made by the city manager are supported by substantial evidence presented during the evidentiary hearing. The city council, acting as the appellate body, may sustain, reverse or modify the decision of the city manager or remand the matter for further consideration, which remand shall include specific issues to be considered or a direction for a de novo hearing. 
2.  Findings. The written decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval: 
a.  The requested accommodation is requested by or on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws. 
b.  The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
c.  The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city as "undue financial or administrative burden" is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law. 
d.  The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program, as "fundamental alteration" is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law. 
e.  The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
In making these findings, the decision-maker may approve alternative reasonable accommodations which provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant. 
3.  The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling: 
a.  Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability. 
b.  Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation. 
c.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants. 
d.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting. 
4.  The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program: 
a.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood. 
b.  Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking. 
c.  Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an applicable specific plan. 
d.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation. 
5.  Rules while decision is pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 
6.  Effective date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until a decision is made by the city council on such appeal. 
E.  Expiration, time extension, violation, discontinuance and revocation. 
1.  Expiration. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms this section shall expire within twenty-four months from the effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless: 
a.  A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced; 
b.  A certificate of occupancy has been issued; 
c.  The use is established; or 
d.  A time extension has been granted. 
2.  Time extension. The city manager may approve a time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause for a period or periods not to exceed one year. An application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the community development director no less than thirty days or more than ninety days prior to the expiration date. 
3.  Notice. Notice of the city manager's decision on a time extension shall be provided in writing. All written decisions shall give notice of the right to appeal and to request reasonable accommodation in the appeals process as set forth in Subsection E.4. below. 
4.  Appeal of determination. A time extension for a reasonable accommodation shall be final unless appealed to the city council within fourteen calendar days of the date of mailing of the determination. An appeal shall be made in writing and shall be noticed and heard pursuant to the procedures established in Section 20.2.180 of this Code. 
5.  Violation of terms. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this Code may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. 
6.  Discontinuance. A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for one hundred eighty consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a residence vacate, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the community development director determines that: (1) the modification physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the Code; and (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The community development director may request the applicant or his or her successor-in-interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within ten days of the date of a request by the city shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the city of a previously approved reasonable accommodation. 
7.  Revocation. Procedures for revocation shall be as prescribed by Section 20.2.190. 
F.  Amendments. A request for changes in conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval shall be treated as a new application. The community development director may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve substantial alterations or addition to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval.

Table 3.B
Basic Safety Compatibility Qualities 
Zone 1: Runway Protection Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity
> Very high risk 
> Runway protection zone as defined by FAA criteria 
> For military airports, clear zones as defined by AlCUZ criteria 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> Airport ownership of property encouraged 
> Prohibit all new structures 
> Prohibit residential land uses 
> Avoid nonresidential uses except if very low intensity in character and confined to the sides and outer end of the area 
_____
Zone 2: Inner Approach/Departure Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity
> Substantial risk: RPZs together with inner safety zones encompass 30% to 50% of near-airport aircraft accident sites (air carrier and general aviation) 
> Zone extends beyond and, if RPZ is narrow, along sides of RPZ 
> Encompasses areas overflown at low altitudes - typically only 200 to 400 feet above runway elevation 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> Prohibit residential uses except on large, agricultural parcels 
> Limit nonresidential uses to activities which attract few people (uses such as shopping centers, most eating establishments, theaters, meeting halls, multi-story office buildings, and labor-intensive manufacturing plants unacceptable) 
> Prohibit children's schools, day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes 
> Prohibit hazardous uses (e.g., above ground bulk fuel storage) 
_____
Zone 3: Inner Turning Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity
> Zone primarily applicable to general aviation airports 
> Encompasses locations where aircraft are typically turning from the base to final approach legs of the standard traffic pattern and are descending from traffic pattern altitude 
> Zone also includes the area where departing aircraft normally complete the transition from takeoff power and flap settings to a climb mode and have begun to turn to their en route heading 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> Limit residential uses to very low densities (if not deemed unacceptable because of noise) 
> Avoid nonresidential uses having moderate or higher usage intensities (e.g., major shopping centers, fast food restaurants, theaters, meeting halls, buildings with more than three aboveground habitable floors are generally unacceptable) 
> Prohibit children's schools, large day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes 
> Avoid hazardous uses (e.g., above ground bulk fuel storage) 
_____
Zone 4: Outer Approach/Departure Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity
> Situated along extended runway centerline beyond Zone 3 
> Approaching aircraft usually at less than traffic pattern altitude 
> Particularly applicable for busy general aviation runways (because of elongated traffic pattern), runways with straight-in instrument approach procedures, and other runways where straight-in or straight-out flight paths are common 
> Zone can be reduced in size or eliminated for runways with very-low activity levels 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> In undeveloped areas, limit residential uses to very low densities (if not deemed unacceptable because of noise); if alternative uses are impractical, allow higher densities as infill in urban areas 
> Limit nonresidential uses as in Zone 3 
> Prohibit children's schools, large day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes 
_____
Zone 5: Sideline Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity
> Encompasses close-in area lateral to runways 
> Area not normally overflown; primary risk is with aircraft (especially twins) losing directional control on takeoff 
> Area is on airport property at most airports 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> Avoid residential uses unless airport related (noise usually also a factor) 
> Allow all common aviation-related activities provided that height-limit criteria are met 
> Limit other nonresidential uses similarly to Zone 3, but with slightly higher usage intensities 
> Prohibit children's schools, large day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes 
_____
Zone 6: Traffic Pattern Zone 
Risk Factors/Runway Proximity 
> Generally low likelihood of accident occurrence at most airports; risk concern primarily is with uses for which potential consequences are severe 
> Zone includes all other portions of regular traffic patterns and pattern entry routes 
Basic Compatibility Qualities
> Allow residential uses 
> Allow most nonresidential uses; prohibit outdoor stadiums and similar uses with very high intensities 
> Avoid children's schools, large day care centers, hospitals, nursing homes 
_____
Definitions 
As used in this table, the follow meanings are intended: 
> ;hg; Allow: Use is acceptable 
> ;hg; Limit: Use is acceptable only if density/intensity restrictions are met 
> ;hg; Avoid: Use generally should not be permitted unless no feasible alternative is available 
> ;hg; Prohibit: Use should not be permitted under any circumstances 
> ;hg; Children's Schools: Through grade 12 
> ;hg; Large Day Care Centers: Commercial facilities as defined in accordance with state law; for the purposes here, family day care homes and noncommercial facilities ancillary to a place of business are generally allowed. 
> ;hg; Above ground Bulk Storage of Fuel: Tank size greater than 6,000 gallons (this suggested criterion is based on Uniform Fire Code criteria which are more stringent for larger tank sizes)

a.  It is the purpose and intent of this section to provide an opportunity for interim use of residentially-zoned lands within City limits until such time as the development market supports the intended development of said lands. 
b.  Commercial agricultural cultivation may be allowed with a conditional use permit on an interim basis only where the impacts of an agricultural operation will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area. 
c.  Commercial agricultural cultivation allowed by this section is secondary to its availability for urban development and should be available for development as an urban use when market conditions improve for such a use. 
d.  Use of a subject site for crop cultivation for an interim period does not result in the land being construed as an agricultural resource requiring protection or preservation. 
e.  If residentially zoned, the land, regardless of the status of its agricultural use, will be considered in the City's Housing Element and the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) as available land for residential use. 
f.  It is the intent of this section to limit the use to an initial ten-year term with the option to consider ten-year extensions. At the discretion of the Planning Commission these time periods may be modified and/or reviewed, including a lesser time for the initial term and extensions thereof. 
g.  This section shall not be construed to apply to animal confinement. 
2.  Definitions. 
a.  Commercial Agricultural Cultivation: Agricultural use that results in the production of quantities of crops greater than what could be reasonably consumed in personal or household use and/or crops that are produced with the intent to sell commercially. 
b.  Non-commercial Agricultural Cultivation: Agricultural use that results in the production of quantities of crops that are no greater than what can be reasonably consumed for personal or household [use]; it typically includes tree orchards and flower and vegetable gardens for personal or household use. 
3.  Development Standards. 
a.  Commercial Agricultural Cultivation is a permitted use in the "R-A" (Residential Agricultural) zone district. Commercial Agricultural Cultivation is permitted upon approval of a conditional use permit application pursuant to Chapter 20.2.50 of this Title in the "R-1" (Single Family Residential) zone district. This aforementioned section of Title 20 does not apply to non-commercial agricultural cultivation as an accessory use in residential zone districts, or in districts where commercial agricultural cultivation is allowed as a permitted use. 
b.  The area to be farmed shall be of adequate size, dimension and topography to accommodate the proposed use, and shall comprise a minimum of forty contiguous acres, which may be a portion of a single parcel or a composition of multiple contiguous parcels under the same ownership. 
c.  The applicant/property owner shall not enter into a Williamson Act contract or other agricultural preservation measure, whether for tax reduction or other purposes, during the term of the permitted commercial agricultural cultivation use. 
4.  Conditions of Approval. The following conditions of approval will be considered on a project-by-project basis at the discretion of the Planning Commission: 
a.  Aerial application of fertilizers, pesticides, or other agricultural treatments is not allowed. 
b.  Burning of agricultural waste/trimmings/etc. is not allowed. 
c.  Sale of crops on-site is not allowed. 
d.  Installation of underground storage tanks is not permitted. 
e.  At least ten days prior to the application of pesticides, fungicides, or insecticides, notice will be given to all property owners within three hundred feet of the parcel(s), and notice shall be posted on site along every one hundred feet of street frontage. Notice shall be no smaller than ten inches by twelve inches and with the word "Notice" in eighty-point font. 
f.  Best Management Practices to reduce spray drift will be implemented. 
g.  Wells, as needed to serve the subject site, are subject to approval by the California Department of Public Health Services and review by the City Engineer. 
h.  Irrigation water run-off, if any, shall be contained on site. 
i.  The area shall be groomed of weeds and agricultural waste regularly to reduce potential fire hazard, proliferation of pests, and unsightly conditions. 
j.  Equipment and vehicles related to the active farming operation of the site shall not be parked in the public right of way. 
k.  Vehicular circulation related to the use shall occur on-site. 
l.  A minimum twenty-foot wide drive aisle clearance shall be maintained along all property boundaries 
m.  A vector control plan must be approved with the Conditional Use Permit and implemented for the term of the agricultural use. 
n.  The Planning Commission may consider other conditions as may be appropriate based on the location of the proposed use and may consider limiting some crop types due to impacts of excessive noise, dust, vibration, odors or other effects on surrounding uses.

Chapter 20.5 - COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

20.5.10 - Purpose and intent. 
1.  The General Plan outlines goals, objectives, and policies regarding the character and location of commercial uses and development within the City. It is the purpose of this Chapter to provide regulations which implement those goals, objectives and policies, and which assure the availability of commercial uses within the City. Commercial Districts should be conveniently located, efficient, attractive, and designed in a manner that ensures safe and convenient commercial activity, in order to serve the retail and service commercial needs of City residents and businesses. 
2.  It is the further intent of the regulations contained in this Chapter: 
a.  To provide appropriately located areas for retail stores, service establishments, and commercial commodities and services required by residents of the City and the surrounding market area; 
b.  To encourage the concentration of commercial and office uses for the convenience of the public, and to secure mutually beneficial relationships to one another; 
c.  To provide adequate space to meet the needs of commercial development, including off-street parking and loading areas; 
d.  To minimize traffic congestion and to avoid the overloading of utilities by regulating the construction of buildings of excessive size relative to the land uses in the City; 
e.  To protect commercial properties from noise, odor, smoke, unsightliness, and other objectionable influences incidental to industrial uses; and 
f.  To promote high standards of site planning, architecture and landscape design for commercial developments within the City. 
20.5.20 - Commercial development districts. 
1.  General Commercial (GC). The primary purpose of the General Commercial (GC) District is to provide sites for commercial uses that will serve a large segment of the population with a wide variety of retail, wholesale, service, and office uses. 
2.  Neighborhood Commercial (NC). The primary purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District is to satisfy the daily shopping needs of City residents by providing for a wide range of common retail and personal services in a centralized location. This district encourages the construction of conveniently located neighborhood centers which provide for limited retail and service commercial uses, in a manner which is compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhood. 
3.  Downtown Commercial (DC). 
a.  The primary purpose of the Downtown Commercial (DC) District is to encourage the establishment of a vital commercial, retail and service center for the City that strengthens the local economy, provides a central focus for a wide variety of community-serving businesses and civic uses, and allows for the development of mixed-uses including higher density residential buildings that will support the creation of a vital, active and attractive neighborhood environment. 
b.  The provisions of this Chapter are intended to ensure that the limited commercial and office related development permitted within the DC District respects the historic significance of the downtown area by requiring that all proposed buildings and structures reflect the downtown's architectural theme and are compatible with the surrounding residential community.

Chapter 20.6 - EMPLOYMENT DISTRICTS 
Sections: 

20.6.10 - Purpose and intent. 
1.  The General Plan outlines the goals, objectives and policies establishing the character and location of regional commercial and industrial land uses within the City. It is the purpose of this Chapter to provide regulations that implement those goals, objectives, and policies that assure the availability of a solid and diversified economic base that is capable of offering a wide range of employment opportunities to the residents of the City. 
2.  The provisions of this Chapter are intended to ensure that specific, well-defined patterns of industrial activities are established which are compatible with the surrounding land uses, provide adequate access to the regional transportation network, and accommodate the employment and personal needs of workers and business visitors which meet the service needs of local businesses. 
3.  It is the further intent of the provisions of this Chapter to: 
a.  Preserve appropriate areas for industrial uses and protect these areas from intrusion by residential and other incompatible land uses; 
b.  Protect adjacent land uses from noise, odor, dust, smoke, truck traffic, fire, explosion, radiation and other potential hazards and objectionable influences associated with certain industrial uses; 
c.  Provide adequate open space around industrial structures to protect them from hazards and to minimize the impact of industrial plants on nearby residential or commercial districts; and 
d.  Minimize traffic congestion and avoid overloading utilities by regulating the construction of buildings and structures of excessive size relative to the size of the building parcel. 
20.6.20 - Employment districts. 
1.  Community Retail Commercial (CRC).

Chapter 20.8 - SURFACE MINING AND LAND RECLAMATION REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

20.8.10 - Purpose and intent. 
    The City recognizes that extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic well-being and needs of society and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety. The City also recognizes that surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, biological, and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the specifications may vary accordingly. The purpose and intent of this Section is to regulate surface mining operations as authorized by California's Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code Sections 2710 et seq.), as amended, hereinafter referred to as "SMARA;" and Public Resources Code Section 2207; and the California Code of Regulations adopted pursuant thereto (14 Cal. Code of Regs., Sections 3500 et seq.), to ensure that: 
1.  Adverse environmental and other effects of surface mining operations will be prevented or minimized and reclamation of mined lands will provide for the beneficial, sustainable long-term productive use of the mined and reclaimed lands; and 
2.  The production and conservation of minerals will be encouraged while eliminating hazards to public health and safety and avoiding or minimizing adverse effects on the environment, including but not limited to, geologic subsidence, air pollution, water quality degradation, damage to biological resources, flooding, erosion, degradation of scenic quality, and noise pollution. 
20.8.20 - Incorporation of SMARA and state regulations. 
    The provisions of the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code, Sections 2710 et seq.), Public Resources Code Section 2207, and the California Code of Regulations implementing the Act (14 Cal. Code of Regulations, Sections 3500 et seq.), and 14 Cal. Code of Regulations, Article 9, Chapter 8, Sections 3700 et seq., "Reclamation Standards"), hereinafter also referred to as the "State Regulations," as those provisions may be amended from time to time, are made a part of this Chapter by reference with the same force and effect as if the provisions therein were specifically and fully set out herein, excepting that when the provisions of this Chapter are more restrictive than conflicting State provisions, this Chapter shall prevail. 
20.8.30 - Applicability. 
1.  Reclamation Plan. Unless exempted by the provisions of this Chapter, any person who proposes to engage in surface mining, or who proposes to permit another person to engage in surface mining on his property shall, prior to the commencement of said operations as defined in this Section, first file and obtain approval from the City a Reclamation Plan in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Chapter, as further provided in Sections 2772 et seq. of the Public Resources Code, 14 Cal. Code of Regulations, Article 9, Chapter 8, Sections 3700 et seq.; and financial assurances for reclamation. 
2.  Requirements for Reclamation Plans. A Reclamation Plan shall be required for all surface mining operations in all zone districts in which surface mining is allowed, as well as for those portions of existing surface mining operations which claim to have vested rights pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 2776, unless otherwise exempted from the requirements of SMARA or as set forth herein. Public Resources Code, Sec. 2770 et seq. 
3.  Exemptions. This Chapter shall not apply to the following activities: 
a.  Excavations or grading conducted for farming, on-site construction, or for the purpose of restoring land following a flood or natural disaster (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(a)). 
b.  Prospecting for, or the extraction of, minerals for commercial purposes and the removal of overburden in total amounts of less than one thousand cubic yards in any one location of one acre or less (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(b)). 
c.  Surface mining operations that are required by federal law in order to protect a mining claim, if such operations are conducted solely for that purpose. (SMARA, Sec. 2714(c)). 
d.  Such other surface mining operations which the State Mining and Geology Board determines to be of an infrequent nature and which involve only minor surface disturbances (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(d)). 
e.  Emergency excavations or grading conducted by the Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board for the purpose of averting, alleviating, repairing, or restoring damage to property due to imminent or recent floods, disasters, or other emergencies (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(f)). 
f.  Surface mining operations conducted on lands owned or leased, or upon which easements or rights-of-way have been obtained by the Department of Water Resources for the purpose of the State Water Resources Development System or flood control, and surface mining operations on lands owned or leased, or upon which easements or rights-of-way have been obtained, by the Reclamation Board for the purpose of flood control, if the Department of Water Resources adopts, after submission to and consultation with, the Department of Conservation, a reclamation plan for lands affected by these activities, and those lands are reclaimed in conformance with the standards specified in regulations of the Board adopted pursuant to this Chapter (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(g)(1)). 
Nothing in this Section shall require the Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board to obtain a permit or secure approval of a reclamation plan from the City in order to conduct surface mining operations specified in subsection 1., hereinabove. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the bringing of an enforcement action pursuant to Section 2774.1 if it is determined that a surface mine operator acting under contract with the Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board on lands other than those owned or leased, or upon which easements or rights-of-way have been obtained, by the Department of Water Resources or the Reclamation Board, is otherwise not in compliance with Public Resources Code Sections 2710 et seq. (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2714(g)(2)). 
An exemption under this Chapter does not automatically exempt a project or activity from the application of other regulations, ordinances or policies of the City, including, but not limited to, application of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.), the requirement of site approvals or other permits, the payment of development impact fees, or the imposition of other dedications and exactions as may be permitted under the law. 
20.8.40 - Contents of applications for surface mining operations and reclamation plans. 
1.  Applications for a Reclamation Plan for surface mining or land reclamation projects shall be made on forms provided by the Community Development Department. Said application shall be filed in accord with this Chapter and procedures established by the Community Development Director. 
2.  As many copies of a Reclamation Plan application as may be required shall be submitted in conjunction with all applications for Surface Mining Operations. The Reclamation Plan application shall include information concerning the mining operation that is required for processing the Reclamation Plan. 
3.  Applications shall include all required environmental review forms and information prescribed by the Community Development Director. 
4.  Upon completion of the environmental review procedure, and filing of all documents required by the Community Development Director, consideration of an application for the proposed or existing surface mine shall be completed prior to public hearing before the City Council, pursuant to Section 2774 of the Public Resources Code. 
20.8.50 - Processing. 
1.  Within thirty days of acceptance of an application for surface mining operations and/or a Reclamation Plan as complete, the Community Development Department shall notify the Director of the California Department of Conservation of the filing of the application (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2774(e)). Whenever mining operations are proposed in the 100-year floodplain of any stream, as shown in Zone A of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and within one mile, upstream or downstream, of any state highway bridge, the Community Development Department shall also notify the State Department of Transportation that the application has been received (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2770.5). 
2.  The Community Development Department shall process the application through environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.) and the City's Guidelines implementing CEQA.

5.  That the land and/or resources such as water bodies to be reclaimed will be restored to a condition that is as compatible with and blends in with the surrounding natural environmental, topography, and other resources, or that suitable off-site development will compensate for related disturbances to resource values; 
6.  That the Reclamation Plan will restore the mined lands to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses consistent with the General Plan and applicable resource plan; and 
7.  That a written response to the Director of the California Department of Conservation has been prepared, describing the disposition of major issues raised by the Director of the California Department of Conservation. Where the City's position is at variance with the recommendations and objections raised by the Director of the California Department of Conservation, said response shall address, in detail, why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2772(d)). 
20.8.90 - Financial assurances for reclamation plans. 
1.  In order to ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved Reclamation Plan, the City shall require, as a condition of approval, security which will be released upon satisfactory performance. The applicant may post security in an acceptable form of a surety bond, trust fund, irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial institution, trust funds or other method acceptable to the City and the Mining and Geology Board (the "Board") as specified in statewide regulations adopted by the Board, and which the City reasonably determines are adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the surface mining operation's approved Reclamation Plan. Financial assurances shall be made payable to the City and the Department of Conservation (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2773.1(a)(4)). 
2.  Financial assurances will be required to ensure compliance with elements of the Reclamation Plan including but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements; restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat; restoration of waterbodies and water quality; slope stability and erosion and drainage control; disposal of hazardous materials; and other mitigation measures. Financial assurances for such elements of the Plan shall be monitored by the Community Development Department. 
3.  The amount of the financial assurances shall be based upon the estimated costs of reclamation for the years or phases stipulated in pursuant to the approved Reclamation Plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas as may be required, subject to adjustment for the actual amount required to reclaim lands disturbed by surface mining activities since January 1, 1976, and new lands to be disturbed by surface mining activities in the upcoming year, as provided in subsection 6., hereinbelow. Cost estimates shall be prepared by a licensed engineer and/or other qualified professionals retained by the operator and approved by the Community Development Director. The estimated amount of the financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities necessary to implement the approved Reclamation Plan, the unit costs for each of these activities, the number of units of each of these activities, and the actual administrative costs. Financial assurances to ensure compliance with revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, and any other applicable element of the approved Reclamation Plan shall be based upon cost estimates that include, but may not be limited to, labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration, and reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee. 
4.  In projecting the costs of financial assurances, it shall be assumed without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the City or State may need to contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site. 
5.  The financial assurances shall remain in effect for the duration of the surface mining operation and any additional period until reclamation is completed, including any maintenance required (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2772.1(a)(2)). 
6.  The amount of financial assurances required of a surface mining operation for any one year shall be adjusted annually to account for new lands disturbed by surface mining operations, inflation, and reclamation of lands accomplished in accordance with the approved Reclamation Plan (Public Resources Code, Sec. 2773.1(a)(3)). The financial assurances shall include estimates to cover reclamation for existing conditions and anticipated activities during the upcoming year, excepting that the permittee may not claim credit for reclamation scheduled for completion during the coming year. 
7.  Revisions to financial assurances shall be submitted to the Community Development Director each year prior to the anniversary date for approval of the financial assurances. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of existing disturbance and anticipated activities for the next calendar year, including any required interim reclamation. If revisions to the financial assurances are not required, the operator shall explain, in writing, why revisions are not required. 
20.8.100 - Inspections.

    Except as provided in this Title, the following utility lines, existing and proposed shall be installed underground in conjunction with new development projects. Said undergrounding of utility lines shall include, but not be limited to, all new electrical distribution lines, existing electrical distribution lines of thirty-five thousand Volts or less, telephone lines, street light service lines, cable television and similar service wires or cable as which: 
a.  Provides new service to the property being developed; 
b.  Are existing and located within the boundaries of the property being developed; 
c.  Are existing between the property line and the centerline of the peripheral streets of the property being developed; or 
d.  Are along the project perimeter boundary. 
2.  Responsibility for Compliance. Arrangements, including payment of all costs, for undergrounding utility lines shall be made by the developer or owner of the property to be developed with the serving utility company(s). Undergrounding of utility lines and structures may be done by the developer, or owner, with permission from the serving utility. 
3.  Timing of Compliance. Undergrounding shall be completed: 
a.  Prior to the inspection approval of related street improvements; or 
b.  Prior to building occupancy if no related street improvements are required. 
4.  General Exceptions. The following exceptions shall apply: 
a.  Temporary overhead utility lines including necessary service poles, wires, and cables may be permitted and installed to the satisfaction of the Building Official for the period during which authorized construction is continuing for which valid building permits have been issued. All temporary overhead utility lines shall be removed prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy. 
b.  Appurtenances and associated equipment including, but not limited to, surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts from an underground system, may be placed above ground and installed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. 
c.  In established residential areas where overhead utility lines presently exist along or near lot lines and where an in-fill single-family dwelling unit is being developed on a single lot, or where an in-fill two-family or duplex dwelling unit is being developed on a single lot, overhead utility lines may be permitted and installed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer. 
5.  Exceptions Approved by the City Engineer. The following further exceptions may apply, subject in each case to the specific written approval of the City Engineer, and then only on the basis of a formal request detailing the reasons therefore: 
a.  On developments consisting of three lots or less that do not in total exceed one hundred fifty feet of frontage for residential, commercial, office professional, business park, public/institutional, or industrial development, the City Engineer may waive construction of underground utility lines along the peripheral streets or property lines, however, all on site utility service lines shall be installed underground. In such a situation, the developer or property owner shall deposit the cost, as determined by the City Engineer, for undergrounding utility lines along the peripheral streets or property lines with the City for future undergrounding work to be done by the City. 
b.  A new single-family residence constructed in rural undeveloped areas where there are no existing utility lines within a quarter mile radius. However, in such a situation, the developer or property owner shall deposit the cost as determined by the City Engineer for undergrounding utility lines along the peripheral streets or property lines with the City for future undergrounding work to be done by the City. 
6.  Nonconforming Structures. Buildings and structures which, on the effective date of this Title or any subsequent amendments thereto, are nonconforming in regard to above ground on-site utility lines and structures, may continue to be used, altered or enlarged in the same manner, as if such nonconforming utility lines did not exist. 
7.  Appeals. An appeal, along with the appropriate fee, may be submitted to the City Council for the consideration of waiving all or portions of the requirements of this Section due to topographic conditions, soil or other factors that render undergrounding unreasonable or impractical. All appeals shall be in writing, and shall state the reason why undergrounding is unreasonable or impractical. Appeals shall include a preliminary estimate of cost, in writing, from the serving utility company(s).

Chapter 20.11 - SPECIFIC USE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Sections: 

20.11.10 - Purpose and intent. 
1.  It is the purpose and intent of this Chapter to identify land uses and activities which possess the potential to cause deleterious effects to the community in which they are located, and to subject such uses to specific regulations with the intent of minimizing, to the extent practical, these deleterious effects. Further, it is intended that in the zone districts in which these land uses are permitted, they are conducted in a manner which is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in accordance with the goals, policies, objectives and implementation programs contained in the General Plan. 
2.  It is further determined that it is in the interest of public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City to protect minors from viewing publicly displayed harmful matter, and that pursuant to Penal Code Sections 313.1(d) and (e) the City is authorized to adopt ordinances which restrict the display of harmful matter to minors by the use of blinder racks. It has also been found that there exists an increasing trend toward the display of harmful matter, within the meaning of Penal Code Section 313, at grocery stores, convenience stores, video stores, and other retail outlets, as well as from newsracks, and that restriction of public display of such harmful matter will keep the adverse impacts of such harmful matter upon minors to a minimum. 
20.11.20 - Applicability. 
    The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the activities and land uses specified by this section in addition to any standards and regulations established by this Title which may also be applicable to these specified land uses or activities. 
20.11.30 - Adult-oriented businesses. 
1.  Applicability. It is the intent of this Chapter to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in the crime, and in addition the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Title to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of Adult-Oriented Businesses in certain areas. 
2.  Findings of the City Council. 
a.  The City Council, in adopting this ordinance, takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of Adult-Oriented Businesses in other cities: American Center for Law and Justice (1996); New York, New York (1994); State of New Jersey (1994); Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington (1989); Austin, Texas (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Houston, Texas (1983); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Whittier, California (1978); Amarillo, Texas (1977), Cleveland, Ohio (1977); Los Angeles, California (1977). The City Council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the City in enacting this ordinance to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of Adult-Oriented Businesses, and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that: 
(1)  Adult-Oriented Businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas. 
(2)  Both the proximity of Adult-Oriented Businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located. 
(3)  The proximity and concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses adjacent to residential, recreational, religious, educational and other Adult-Oriented Business uses can cause other businesses and residence to move elsewhere. 
(4)  There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by Adult-Oriented Businesses, including, but not limited to, an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use, prostitution, pandering and violence against persons and property. The studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that Adult-Oriented Businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas, causing, among other adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. 
b.  Based on the foregoing, the City Council finds and determines that special regulation of Adult-Oriented Businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas. The need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that Adult-Oriented Businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks, schools, churches, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of Adult-Oriented Businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects. 
c.  The locational requirements, established by this Chapter, do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected Adult Oriented Businesses that are provided by this ordinance. 
d.  In developing this ordinance, the City Council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of Adult-Oriented Businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendments of the United States and California Constitutions, but instead desires to enact reasonable time, place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of Adult Oriented Businesses. The City Council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding local regulations of Adult-Oriented Businesses, including but not limited to: Young v. American Mini Theaters. Inc. 427 U.S. 50 (1976) (Reh. Denied 475 U.S. 1132); FWIPBS. Inc. v. Dallas. 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glenn Theater. 501 U.S. 560 (1991); United States Court of Appeals 9th Circuit decisions, including but not limited to: Topanga Press. et a. v. City of Los Angeles. 989 F.2d 1524 (1993); several California cases including but not limited to: City of National City v. Wiener. 3 Cal.4th 832 (1993); People v. Superior Court (Lucero) 49 Cal.3d 14 (1989); and City of Vallejo v. Adult Books et al. 167 Cal.App.3d 1169 (1985); and other federal cases including Lakeland Lounge v.

City of Biloxi (5th Cir. 1986) 779 F.2d 1074. 
e.  The City Council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of Adult-Oriented Businesses are in the public interest. In addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates, decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located, the City Council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of K v, Inc. v. Kitsav County, 793 F.2d 1053 (1986), regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution, drug dealing, and other law enforcement problems. 
f.  The City Council finds the following, in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decision in the public record: 
(1)  Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in Adult-Oriented Businesses (collectively referred to as 'performers') have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of Adult-Oriented Businesses on the site of the Adult-Oriented Business; 
(2)  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed buy Adult-Oriented Businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows; 
(3)  Evidence indicates that performers at Adult-Oriented Businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment; 
(4)  Evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths, individual viewing areas, and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly, have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity; 
(5)  As a result of the above, and the increase in incidents of AIDS and Hepatitis B, which are both sexually transmitted diseases, the City has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the possibility of the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at Adult-Oriented Businesses. 
g.  Zoning, licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate, reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the City and to help assure that all operators of Adult-Oriented Businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the diverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses. 
h.  The City Council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such Adult Oriented Businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values, and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses, which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking through or visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses; and the City Council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of Adult-Oriented Businesses and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses; deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases. 
i.  It is not the intent of the City Council in enacting this ordinance, or any provision thereof, to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the City Council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the City. 
j.  Nothing in this ordinance is intended to authorize, legalize, or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any City ordinance or any statue of the State of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. 
k.  The City Council finds the following in part, based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record: 
(1)  Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in Adult-Oriented Businesses (collectively referred to as 'performers') have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of Adult-Oriented Businesses on the site of the Adult-Oriented Business; 
(2)  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by Adult- Oriented Businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows; 
(3)  Evidence indicates that performers at Adult-Oriented Businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment. 
l.  In prohibiting public nudity in Adult-Oriented Businesses, the City Council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity, but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity; and 
m.  The City Council also finds, as a wholly independent basis, that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality, and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity; and 
n.  While the City Council desires to protect the rights conferred by the United States Constitution to Adult-Oriented Businesses, it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the City and diminishes, to the greatest extent feasible, those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development operation of Adult-Oriented Businesses; and 
o.  In enacting a nudity limitation, the City declares that the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense. The City has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation. The City adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an Adult-Oriented Business permit issued pursuant to the City Code; and 
p.  The City Council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in Adult-Oriented Businesses; and 
q.  Requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales and/or transact sexual favors within the Adult-Oriented Business; and 
r.  Enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within Adult Oriented Businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises, including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease. Requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times, and that adequate lighting be provided are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for, and therefore the incidence of illegal conduct within Adult-Oriented Businesses, and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel.

c.  The Community Development Director may approve a parking adjustment with conditions which are found to be necessary to effectuate the purpose of these adjustments within the Downtown Commercial zone district; the decision of which may be appealed to the Planning Commission as provided in section 20.2.180 (Appeals) of this Title. 
(1)  Notice . Notice of an application for a parking adjustment shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation not less than ten days prior to the date set for the Community Development Director hearing. Notices shall also be mailed not less than ten days prior to the date of the meeting to owners of property within a radius of three hundred feet of the external boundaries of the property proposed for the modification described on the application, using for this purpose the name and address of such owners as shown on the latest official tax role of the County. 
(2)  Findings for Approval. The Community Development Director, in approving a Parking Adjustment, shall find as follows: 
(a)  The proposed parking modification and use of the structure is necessary or desirable for the development of the community, is in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the General Plan, and is not detrimental to existing uses or to uses specifically permitted in the zone district; 
(b)  That approving the proposed parking adjustment and use will significantly improve the possibility that the structure will be preserved and maintained; 
(c)  That the required parking cannot be provided without the approval of the requested adjustment; 
(d)  That the proposed parking scheme will function safely; 
(e)  That approval of the parking adjustment will not harm the integrity of the structure or the surrounding neighborhood. 
2.  Shared Parking. 
a.  A maximum reduction of thirty percent of the minimum parking requirements for individual uses may be granted by the Planning Agency where joint use of parking facilities or other factors will mitigate peak parking demand. 
b.  Requests for parking reductions resulting from joint usage shall be supported by information that generally follows the format described below: 
(1)  Initial project review involves documentation and quantification of proposed land uses and anticipated functional relationships between the parking needs of different land uses. The initial review will consist of data gathering regarding proximity to transit facilities, general location of parking facilities, surrounding land uses and mix, predicted pedestrian patterns, and similar variables which affect parking needs. 
(2)  Adjustments for Peak Parking Factor includes calculating the number of off-street parking spaces required for each land use within the area proposed for joint parking use based upon the requirements of section 20.13.30 of this Chapter. Other elements to be considered include seasonal adjustment for parking demand and a determination of the mode of transit used in reaching or departing the area being considered. 
(3)  Analysis of Hourly Accumulation involves an estimation of hourly parking accumulations for each land use during a typical week day or weekend day. 
(4)  Estimate of Shared Parking merges the hourly parking demand estimate to calculate the overall parking required to be provided within the area being considered for shared parking facilities. 
c.  In granting parking reductions for shared use of parking facilities, the Planning Agency shall make one or more of the following findings: 
(1)  The report justifies the requested parking reduction based upon the presence of two or more adjacent land uses which, because of their substantially different operating hours or difference peak parking characteristics, will allow joint use of the same parking facilities. 
(2)  The report indicates that there are public transportation facilities and/or pedestrian circulation opportunities that justify the requested reduction of parking facilities. 
(3)  The report finds that the use otherwise adheres to the parking standards in this Chapter. 
(4)  The report finds that the clustering of different land uses is such that a reduced number of parking spaces can serve multiple trip purposes to the area in question. 
d.  As a condition of approval to the granting of a reduction in required parking, the Planning Agency may require the granting of reciprocal access and parking agreements with surrounding properties; recordation of conditions, covenants, and restrictions; or creation of other legal instruments to assure the permanent continuation of the circumstances under which parking requirement reductions were granted. 
e.  Where parking spaces are provided for an individual development on a separate parcel, a joint access agreement will be required between affected property owners, in a form acceptable to the City. 
3.  Transportation Management Plans. 
a.  The number of parking spaces required for a project may be decreased up to twenty percent subject to Community Development Director approval of a transportation management plan supplied by the applicant for those applications requesting more than a ten percent reduction. Said plan shall provide evidence that identifies the actual parking requirement and supports and justifies the parking reduction request. Such a plan may include, but is not limited to car pooling, van pools, and staggered work hours. 
b.  Decreases in the required number of parking spaces, approved pursuant to this subsection, may be in addition to any other reductions allowed by this section. 
c.  Before approving such a request, the Community Development Director shall consider, among other factors: 
(1)  Projected effectiveness of car pool, van pool, staggered work hours, or similar transportation management programs. 
(2)  Proximity to public transportation facilities that could be reasonably expected to serve a significant portion of employees and/or customers. 
(3)  Evidence of the likelihood that employees and/or customers will utilize regular transportation alternatives rather then individual use of automobiles, including transportation management plans prepared pursuant to San Joaquin Unified Air Pollution Control District requirements and Chapter 20.12 of this Title. 
4.  Low Percentage of Usable Space. 
a.  Where buildings contain extensive areas of employee facilities such as, but not limited to, cafeterias, racquetball courts, health facilities, covered patios, multiple stairways and elevator shafts, or atriums in multiple story buildings, gross leasable space may be significantly below the eighty-five percent average assumed in the parking schedules. In such cases, a proportionate reduction in parking requirements may be granted by the Community Development Director. 
b.  To be eligible for reduction in parking requirements, due to low percentage of usable space, the applicant shall submit a detailed floor plan breaking down the proposed usage of all square footage within the building. 
c.  As a condition of granting a reduction in parking requirements, due to low percentage of usable space, the applicant shall be required to sign an agreement stating that the percentage of leasable space will not be increased unless additional parking is provided pursuant to the requirements of this Chapter. 
5.  Off-Site Parking Facilities. Required parking for a development may be provided off-site under certain instances. Requests for off-site parking facilities shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  The off-site parking shall be located so that it will adequately serve the use for which it is intended. In making this determination, the following shall be considered: 
(1)  Proximity of the off-site parking facilities; 
(2)  Ease of pedestrian access to the off-site parking facility; 
(3)  The type of use which the off-site parking is intended to serve, recognizing that such facilities are generally not appropriate for high-turnover uses; 
(4)  The need for locating parking facilities off-site, and the resulting urban design benefits of off-site parking, if any. 
b.  As a condition of granting approval to the development of off-site parking facilities, the applicant and other involved parties shall be required to sign an agreement ensuring the continued availability of the off-street parking facilities for the use they are intended to serve.

b.  All automobile spaces required for multifamily residential uses shall be located a maximum of one hundred fifty feet from the dwelling units they are serving. 
(1)  Distances shall be measured from a dwelling unit's entry to the parking space(s) serving that unit. For developments where a stairway or elevator provides access to a dwelling, the ground floor entry to that stairway or elevator shall be considered to be the dwelling entry for purposes of measuring distances to parking spaces. 
(2)  Because design considerations may make it impossible or undesirable to meet the maximum distance requirement, a variation to this requirement may be approved pursuant to section 20.13.50 (Adjustments to Off-Street Parking Requirements) of this Chapter. 
c.  All handicapped spaces shall be located as closely as possible to the entrance to the use they are intended to serve and shall be oriented so that the user of the handicapped parking space need not go past the rear of the parking space in order to reach said entrance. 
d.  All car pool parking spaces shall be clearly marked "Reserved for Carpool" and shall be located as close as possible to the entrance of the use they are intended to serve. 
e.  Permitted compact car spaces shall be dispersed throughout the parking facility in groups of five or more, if at least five compact spaces are provided. The location of compact parking facilities shall be approved by the Community Development Director. 
f.  All bicycle spaces shall be located as closely as possible to the entrance of the use they are intended to serve, but situated in a way that does not obstruct primary pedestrian circulation. 
g.  Bicycle facilities shall be located in highly visible areas to minimize conditions conducive to theft and vandalism. 
6.  Landscape and Screening Requirements/Parking Lot Shading Requirements. It is the purpose of this section to provide reasonable standards for landscaping of uncovered automobile parking areas. The standards as set forth are to promote an attractive visual environment, promote a transition between land uses, and reduce energy consumption in buildings and to decrease high summer temperature by blocking heat and glare. 
a.  Each unenclosed parking facility, excluding detached single-family residences, shall contain a minimum landscaped area in accordance with Table 13.D. of this Chapter. Where the total parking provided is separated by differences in grade or by at least ten feet of nonpaved area, each such area shall be considered to be a separate facility for the purpose of this requirement. 
The parking area shall be computed by including the areas used for access drives, aisles, stalls, maneuvering areas, and landscaping areas within that portion of the project site that is devoted to vehicular parking and circulation. 
Table 13.D 
Minimum Parking Area Landscaping 
Size of Facility 
(in square feet) Minimum Landscape Area 
(percent of total parking area) Under 15,000 feet  5.0% 15,001-29,999  7.5% 30,000 and greater 10.0%  
b.  All automobile parking areas with a capacity of eight parking spaces or more shall contain shade trees so that within fifteen years of planting forty percent of the parking stalls and back-up aisles shall be in shade. This standard will require a minimum of one tree well or planter at a maximum ratio of one tree for each eight parking spaces. When special circumstances or exceptional characteristics are applicable to the property involved (size, slope, extent of use, etc.) this standard may be modified by the Planning Commission. 
c.  No more than ten parking spaces shall be permitted in a single row unless separated by a landscaped island. Should anyone submitting a development proposal be either unwilling or unable to comply with this provision, that person may appear before the Community Development Director for its determination as to whether or not this provision shall apply. 
(1)  Landscaped islands shall have the following minimum dimensions, exclusive of curbing, and shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the growth of trees: 
(a)  Five feet wide by nineteen feet long for a single row of full size parking spaces. 
(b)  Five feet wide by thirty-eight feet long for a double row of full size parking spaces. 
(c)  Five (5) feet wide by sixteen (16) feet long for a single row of compact parking spaces. 
(d)  Five feet wide by thirty-two feet long for a double row of compact parking spaces. 
(2)  Within each landscaped island, a minimum of one canopy-type tree, at least fifteen gallons in size, shall be provided. 
d.  All landscaped areas shall be provided with an automatic irrigation system, which shall be continuously maintained. 
e.  In addition to the preceding landscape standards, parking facilities containing more than three thousand six hundred square feet of uncovered parking area shall include landscape islands at the ends of all parking lanes. 
f.  The parking area landscape standards, contained herein, shall not apply to temporary parking facilities; however, minimum landscaping may be required for temporary parking facilities as part of the issuance of a temporary use permit. 
g.  Factors to be considered in determining compliance with this requirement are as follows: 
(1)  Shade trees shall generally be evenly distributed throughout the parking surface area. Multiple canopies shading the same surface area shall not be counted as multiple credits. 
(2)  Trees planted along the perimeter of a lot may be counted as providing shade for only that portion of the paved area that is shaded. 
(3)  Landscaped planters beneath the canopy may be considered shaded paved parkway areas for determining compliance. 
(4)  All trees shall be installed within a tree well or continuous planter entirely enclosed within a concrete curb not less than six inches high. Growing area shall not be less than four feet wide. 
(5)  Shrubs and trees shall be arranged in such a way as to avoid damage from the front of parked cars extending into the planter area. 
(6)  Tree placement shall permit adequate sight-distance for motorists and pedestrians and shall not interfere with the effectiveness of parking lot lighting. 
7.  Access. 
a.  Parking Access from Streets. 
(1)  Access to parking spaces, other than four or fewer spaces serving a residential use, shall not require backing onto a public or private street. 
(2)  All spaces within a parking facility shall be accessible without entering a public right-of-way or private street. 
b.  Driveway Widths and Clearances. For purposes of this Section, a driveway shall be defined as an access leading from a public street, a right-of-way, or a private street to a parking area, or from one parking area to another, but shall not be defined to include any aisle, or maneuvering area. All driveways shall comply with the following standards: 
(1)  Driveways for single-family structures shall not be less than ten feet in width for a one-car garage and sixteen feet in width for a two-car garage, and shall be maintained free and clear of all obstructions. 
(2)  Driveways for multifamily dwelling units and nonresidential uses shall be in accordance with the requirements of Table 13.E of this Chapter. 
(3)  Driveways which serve a single-family development shall be defined as the paved area leading from a public street, or right-of-way, or a private street to the designated parking area. 
(4)  All abandoned or unused existing driveway approaches, within a street right-of-way, shall be removed and shall be replaced with sidewalk, curb, and gutter at the expense of the lot owner in accordance with the standards adopted in this Title. 
c.  Gated Entries. Gates which serve to limit or control access to parking facilities require special consideration and regulation since their design may significantly impact parking demand and usage, as well as vehicular circulation into and within the parking area. Requests for gated entries shall be submitted to the Community Development Director and shall be accompanied by a study addressing the following issues: 
(1)  Type and operation of gate; 
(2)  Adequacy of vehicle stacking area; 
(3)  Effect of gated entry on parking usage and distribution on the site; and 
(4)  Effect of gated entry on parking for surrounding or adjacent areas. 
8.  Loading Area Design Requirements. 
a.  Loading areas shall be designed to provide adequate area for backing and maneuvering on-site, and shall not require maneuvering within public rights-of-way or backing onto or from a public street. 
b.  Loading doors fronting a public street shall not be located closer than seventy feet from the property line, and shall not encroach into side or rear setback areas. 
c.  Screen walls and wing walls for screening loading areas shall have a maximum height of twelve feet.

CHAPTER 20.14 - SIGN REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

20.14.10 - Intent. 
1.  Signs are considered to be an essential economic and visual element of any community. They contribute significantly to its visual quality, thus influencing perceptions of that community. In communities where there has been an uncontrolled proliferation of signs, the result has often been clutter, confusion, and visual blight to the detriment of that community's image, and to its economic development. However, under proper regulation, signs may be designed and displayed to effectively convey their intended message and to help create a community, which is well-organized and visually appealing. 
2.  It is the intent of this Chapter to control proposed and existing signs in the City in order to protect its physical and economic environment, to implement the policies of the General Plan, and to promote public health, safety and general welfare. 
    The general objectives and provisions of this Chapter are intended to: 
a.  Ensure that signs serve primarily to identify an establishment on a site and to direct persons to various activities and enterprises in order to provide for maximum public convenience; 
b.  Ensure that signs are compatible and harmonious with their surroundings and adjacent land uses; 
c.  Ensure that signs are expressive of the identity of the individual properties and of the community as a whole; 
d.  Avoid traffic hazards by minimizing visual competition among signs and by providing clear identification of businesses. 
e.  Encourage signs which are well designed and attractive in appearance and provide incentives and latitude for variety, innovation, pleasing design relationships, and spacing; and 
f.  Provide criteria for signs to ensure the development of a high quality visual environment. 
3.  It is the City's policy and intent to regulate all signs in a manner that is consistent with the United States and California Constitutions, and which is content-neutral as to protected noncommercial speech. 
4.  Subject to the property owner's approval, a protected noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure is legal, without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval, permitting or notice to the City. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. 
5.  When any parcel, land use or structure has not used all of its permissible sign area for commercial messages, then the unused portion may be employed for the display of signs displaying noncommercial messages. In such cases, a permit is required only if the sign qualifies as a structure that is subject to a building permit under the California Building Code and/or City Ordinance. This allowable message substitution shall not create a right to increase the total amount of signage permitted on a parcel, or for a land use or structure; nor shall it allow the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of either an on-site commercial message or a noncommercial message. 
6.  Within this chapter, the distinction between on-site signs and off-site signs applies only to commercial speech messages. It does not apply to signs displaying noncommercial messages or messages providing directional or other factual information. 
(Ord. No. 2013-1263, § 1(Exh. A-1), 6-17-2013) 
20.14.20 - Administration. 
1.  Compliance Required. No person, business, organization or entity of any kind whatsoever shall place, erect or maintain or cause or allow to be placed, erected or maintained any sign or sign structure, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter. 
a.  Any sign or sign structure, which is being displayed or is being poorly maintained in violation of the provisions of this Title, shall be taken down, removed, or altered to comply with the provisions of this Chapter. It shall be the responsibility of the owner, agent, or person having the beneficial use of the building or structure or land upon which such sign or sign structure may be found to take down, remove or alter the sign or sign structure to comply with the provisions of this Chapter. 
2.  Sign Permits and Review. 
a.  Permits Required. No sign or sign structure shall be placed, erected or maintained within the City without prior issuance of a sign permit unless such sign is specifically exempted by this Title or by other City Ordinance. Building and electrical permits may also be required. Signs or sign structures placed, erected, or maintained without all required permits, and not exempted by this Title or by other City Ordinance, shall be deemed illegal. 
b.  Permit Applications. Applications for sign permits or for approval of Planned Sign Programs shall be made on forms provided by the Community Development Director and shall be accompanied by plans and exhibits as required. Upon receipt of a sign application, the Community Development Director shall inform the applicant as to the completeness of the submittal and of additional materials required, if any. No sign application shall be forwarded to the appropriate reviewing authority for approval, approval subject to modifications, or denial, until the applicant has submitted a complete application. 
c.  Review and Decision. The reviewing authority shall determine if the proposed sign or Planned Sign Program conforms to the provisions of this Chapter and shall accordingly approve, approve subject to modifications and/or conditions, or deny the sign application. 
3.  Written Authorization. Written authorization shall be required from the owner or authorized agent of the premises prior to placing, erecting or maintaining a sign or sign structure on any property. 
4.  Review Responsibilities. 
a.  Community Development Director. The following signs shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director: 
(1)  All initial Planned Sign Programs. 
(2)  Freestanding directional signs (e.g., parking lot entry signs) over four square feet in area and four feet in height. 
(3)  Any sign requiring a sign permit as required by the provisions of this Title. 
b.  Planning Commission. Generally, the following signs shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission: 
(1)  Sign variances. 
(2)  Where signage is part of a development application requiring Planning Commission review. 
5.  Interpretations. In all sign applications, where a matter of interpretation arises, the more specific definition or the more rigorous standard shall prevail. Whenever the Community Development Director determines that the application of any provision for this Chapter is uncertain, the issue shall be referred to the Planning Commission for determination. 
6.  Appeals. Appeals to decisions regarding signs shall be filed and reviewed pursuant to the provisions of section 20.2.180 of this Title except that the Planning Commission shall consider appeals of all staff decisions upon receipt of any such appeal. 
7.  Variances. Variances from the requirements of this Chapter shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 20.2.60 of this Title. In addition to the findings specified in section 20.2.60, the following additional findings shall be made prior to approving a variance for signs: 
a.  The site has a unique character or features that cause visibility problems, thus causing undue economic burden or business hardship; and 
b.  No other proposed signing alternative or design would be feasible or would provide reasonable signage in accordance with this Chapter; and 
c.  The proposed sign does not create a traffic hazard; and 
d.  The proposed sign does not create a visual blight to the community; and 
e.  The proposed sign does not adversely affect adjacent properties; and 
f.  The proposed sign is in compliance with the provisions of this Title in regard to regulations apart from those imposed by this Chapter. 
8.  Illegal Signs. 
a.  The following signs and sign structures shall be considered illegal: 
(1)  Unsafe Signs or Sign Structures. A sign or sign structure shall be deemed unsafe if determined by the Building Official to be a danger or to create a potential hazard to the public. 
(2)  Abandoned Signs and Sign Structures. A sign or sign structure which, for a period of one hundred eighty days or more, does not advertise or identify an ongoing business, business product, or service available on or off the premises where the sign or sign structure is located, shall be deemed abandoned. 
(3)  Illegally Erected Signs and Sign Structures. A sign or sign structure shall be illegally erected if it violates any provision of this Chapter including but not limited to, a sign or sign structure which does not have required permits, or a sign or sign structure which has been erected without first complying with all ordinances and regulations in effect at its time of construction and erection or use. No sign or sign structure that was placed or erected in violation of any previously existing sign ordinances or regulations, by virtue of adoption of this Chapter, shall become conforming or legal. 
b.  All illegal signs and sign structures are hereby deemed to be nuisances. 
9.  Prohibited Signs and Sign Structures. The following types of signs are prohibited in the City: 
a.  Signs or sign structures having any animated, moving or rotating parts, except for signs or sign structures which have historical marketing significance unique to a profession, rather than an individual business, such as barber poles, including signs that have alternating messages that change more than once an hour. Notwithstanding the above, time and temperature displays may be permitted in Commercial and Employment zone districts. 
b.  Flashing or otherwise light-animated signs which contain or are illuminated by lights which are intermittently on and off, change in intensity, or which create the illusion of flashing in any manner. 
c.  Signs, which make sounds. 
d.  Signs or sign structures which by color, wording, design, location or illustration resemble, obscure, imitate, or otherwise limit the effectiveness of traffic control signs or devices. 
e.  Signs or sign structures which create a potential safety hazard by obscuring a clear view of pedestrian or vehicular traffic.

k.  Signs or sign structures placed within, on, or over public right-of-way, on public land, or on utility poles, unless an encroachment permit has been approved for such a sign by the City Engineer. 
l.  Any sign or sign structure not specifically permitted in this Chapter. 
m.  Any sign that projects more than twelve inches from a building wall. 
10.  Enforcement. It shall be the duty and authority of the Code Enforcement Officer to enforce the provisions of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2013-1263, § 1(Exh. A-2), 6-17-2013) 
20.14.30 - Sign standards. 
    The following design criteria shall be used by the Community Development Director in order to determine if a proposed sign is consistent with the intent of this Chapter: 
1.  Identification. Major identification signs shall serve primarily to identify the name or type of business or other land use. 
2.  Architectural Context. Sign design shall harmonize with the architectural design and details of the building it serves, with other signs on the building, with the building's surroundings, and with the business or other activity that the sign identifies. Further, signs shall not cover or obstruct significant architectural elements. 
3.  Design Elements. The following design elements shall be addressed: 
a.  Materials. Creativity in use of materials is encouraged. Durable materials, which are compatible in appearance with the building supporting or identified by the sign, shall be used. 
b.  Colors. Sign colors should harmonize with the building it serves and with adjacent landscaping and buildings. 
c.  Letter Style. Simple lettering styles should be used for ease of identification. Legibility should take priority over complexity in the design of the sign face. 
d.  Illumination. Illuminated signs shall be lighted to the minimum level required to ensure adequate nighttime readability. Specific illumination levels shall be in accordance with this Title. 
e.  Landscaping. Freestanding signs shall be located in a landscaped area, flanking all sides of the sign, which is of a shape, design and size equal to at least the area of the sign face and that is in scale with the overall proportions of the sign and its support structures. 
f.  Signs should not detract from the visibility of other signs on or adjacent to the site where the sign is placed. 
g.  Registered trademarks may be permitted as design elements. 
4.  Sign Area Measurement. For the purposes of this Chapter, sign size shall mean the sign area. Such area shall be more specifically defined as follows: 
a.  Sign Area. Sign size or area shall be defined as the entire area of the sign face, including non-structural perimeter trim and excluding architectural detailing, support structures, and/or uprights on which the sign is supported. 
b.  Window Signs. "Window area" shall be computed by calculating each window pane or panel. The area shall be separate for each building face and for each window. A group of window panes or panels may be considered one window if they are adjoining on the building face and are less than six inches apart. 
c.  Building-Mounted and Wall Signs with Individual Letters. The area of building-mounted or wall signs composed of individual letters affixed to a building or wall shall be considered to be the aggregate area within a maximum of three rectangular figures which enclose and connect the extreme limits of up to three message areas consisting of any writing, representation, emblem or any figure or similar character. 
d.  Wall Sign Panel. If a sign panel is inserted into or onto a wall, the area of the panel shall be considered to be the sign area. 
e.  Double-Faced Signs. If a sign has sign faces, which are placed back to back, no more than two feet from one another, its sign area shall be considered to be the area of the larger face if the two faces are of unequal area. If, for example, the maximum permitted sign area is twenty square feet, a double-faced sign may have an area of twenty square feet on each face. 
f.  Three-Dimensional Signs. If a sign has three or more faces, its sign area shall be considered to be the sum of the areas of each individual face. Thus, if a sign has four faces and the maximum permitted sign area is twenty square feet, the maximum allowable area for each face is five square feet. 
g.  V-Shaped Signs. If a sign is "V"-shaped, with an angle between the two adjoining faces, its sign area shall be the sum of the areas of the two sign faces. 
h.  Separated-Panel Signs. The sign area of separated panel signs (those signs having empty spaces between copy panels) shall be considered to be the entire area encompassed by the sign face, including the empty spaces between panels. 
i.  Signs Painted on Buildings. Any sign painted on a building shall be included in the calculation of the total sign area for the site upon which it is placed. 
5.  Sign Height Measurement. 
Freestanding Signs. Sign height for freestanding signs shall mean the greatest vertical distance, between the top of the sign, including any accompanying architectural features of the sign and the average elevation as measured at the roadbed of the nearest street. 
6.  Sign Location. 
a.  By District. Signs shall be located in accordance with the provisions for each land use district, type of development, or type of sign, as designated in Table 14.A of this Chapter. 
b.  No Off-Site Signs. All signs shall be located on the same premises as the land use or activity identified by the sign, unless the provisions of this Chapter expressly permit the off-site location of a sign. 
c.  Utility Lines. No sign shall be located closer to overhead utility lines than the distance prescribed by California law, or by the rules duly promulgated by agencies of the State, or by the applicable public utility. 
d.  Traffic Safety. No sign shall be located in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear vision of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
e.  Public Right-of-Way. No sign shall be located within, over, or across a public right-of-way except as expressly permitted in section 20.14.20.9.m. of this Chapter. 
7.  Sign Illumination. 
a.  Illumination Levels. The sign permittee shall be required to adjust a sign's illumination level if it is determined to be excessive as the result of the City's evaluation. Illumination shall be considered excessive if it is substantially greater than the illumination of other nearby signs, if it interferes with the visibility of other signs or with the perception of objects or buildings in the vicinity of the sign, if it directs glare toward streets or motorists, or if it adversely impacts nearby residences or neighborhoods. The maximum illumination level for fluorescent lamps shall be four hundred thirty milliamperes. Illumination levels shall be indicated on the sign plan. 
b.  Externally-Illuminated Signs. The light source for externally illuminated signs shall be arranged and shielded to substantially confine all direct light rays to the sign face and away from streets and adjacent properties. Externally-illuminated signs shall be subject to illumination level review. 
8.  Sign Maintenance. Every sign and sign structure within the City shall be maintained in good, safe structural and physical condition. All signs, together with supports, braces, guys, anchors, and electrical components, shall be kept in safe, presentable and good structural condition. All defective or broken parts shall be replaced. Exposed surfaces shall be kept clean, in good repair, and painted where paint is required. The Building Official may order the repair or removal of any sign determined by the Building Official to be unsafe, defective, damaged, or substantially deteriorated. 
9.  Signs on Vehicles. Signs are allowed on vehicles, without sign permits, when they are painted or attached directly to the vehicle so as to not extend or project beyond the vehicle's original profile. Signs, which are painted on or attached to vehicles, must be incidental to the vehicle's primary purpose of transporting people or goods on the public right-of-way, and the vehicle may not be used primarily for advertising purposes. Signs on vehicles may not include arrows or other directional devices, the purpose of which is to direct those who observe such signs to a particular place of business. 
10.  Off-Site Advertising Sign Standards. 
a.  Zones Permitted. Off-Site advertising signs shall be permitted only within the "GC" (General Commercial), "CRC" (Community Retail Commercial) and "I" (Industrial) zone districts within the City of Delano. 
b.  Location of Signs. 
(1)  An off-site advertising sign shall only identify a business or organization whose closest property line of the parcel on which the same business or organization is actually located is no more than three thousand feet from the outer edge of the overlay sign district. 
(2)  An off-site advertising sign for a business or organization shall be located no more than five hundred feet from the centerline of State Route 99. 
(3)  An off-site advertising sign shall be located no closer than five hundred feet to any other off-site advertising sign. 
(4)  An off-site advertising sign shall be located no closer than three hundred feet to any other legally established freestanding sign structure, with the exception of permitted "for sale" and construction site signs. 
(5)  An off-site advertising sign shall be located no closer than one thousand feet to any residentially-zoned or developed parcel. 
c.  Notwithstanding Chapter 20.14.20(9)(j), a sign extending above the roofline or parapet of a structure may be permitted within the overlay sign district in conformance with a Planned Sign Program approved in accordance with Chapter 20.14.80 of this ordinance. 
d.  Sign Size. An off-site advertising sign shall not exceed three hundred square feet in area excluding cutouts or extensions provided they do not exceed thirty square feet in area. 
e.  Sign Height. An off-site advertising sign shall not exceed a height of forty-five feet, not including any cutouts or extensions as referred to in Subsection 20.14.30(10)(d) above. 
f.  Processing. Any proposed off-site advertising sign shall not be permitted except after the submittal of a Planned Sign Program application and its approval by the Community Development Department. 
g.  Changeable Copy Displays. Off-site advertising signs containing electronic or mechanical changeable copy or digital displays shall not be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 2013-1263, § 1(Exh. A-2), 6-17-2013) 
20.14.35 - Signs with changeable copy. 
A.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 20.14.20.9.a above, electronic and mechanical signs that have changeable copy may be allowed in the General Commercial (GC) District and the Community Retail Commercial (CRC) District subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. 
    The following operational and locational criteria shall be addressed for traffic safety and aesthetics and conditioned in the CUP: 
1.  Proposed location and height of the sign with respect to traffic control devices; 
2.  Size and height of proposed sign; 
3.  Existing and proposed illumination levels; 
4.  Length of time between copy changes; 
5.  Method of transition between copy changes; 
6.  Proximity of sign to residential development; 
7.  Cumulative effect of signs with changeable copy in an area or along a street. 
B.  Further, the sign may display commercial identification and the advertising of merchandise and services for only those occupants of the parcel on which the sign is to be located. The sign shall not be used as a billboard for advertising off-site businesses, products, services, or events. The sign may display noncommercial messages. 
C.  Signs with changeable copy shall not contain moving text or graphics, flashing images or changing colors or illumination within the copy being displayed.
