PREFACE 
    The Anderson, California, Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1975, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mr. W. Leonard Wingate, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, Chapter, and Section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 823, passed April 2, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title , then chapter , and ending with section . Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-reerenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with periods. (Example: 31, 32, 32.1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Chapter 1.18 - DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
Sections: 

1.18.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide greater certainty to the city and to applicants for discretionary land use approvals concerning how legal challenges to such projects shall be addressed. Acknowledging that applicants are the parties primarily interested in and benefiting from development approvals sought from the city, and recognizing that legal challenges may result in significant potential public agency expenses even in the event of meritless actions to attack or set aside such approvals, this chapter is intended to require the applicants for discretionary land use approvals to assume the primary responsibility for any such challenges. 
(Ord. 682 § 1 (part), 1999) 
1.18.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter the following words and phrases are used and defined as follows:

The City of Anderson has seen an increase in crime within its jurisdiction and to combat such crime the city's police department has pursued proactive policing methods such as POP (problem oriented policing) and other saturation methods of similar kind. A proactive policing effort has been impactful on the crime rates and safety of those present within the City of Anderson. 
B.  That the City of Anderson's ability to maintain a consistent use of proactive policing methods is conditional on the police department's ability to maintain full staffing, which can be adversely impacted through sworn officers use of sick leave, family medical leave, vacation, and absences of similar kind. 
C.  That the City of Anderson would greatly benefit from a reserve officer program to assist in maintaining full staffing and the resulting police presence where otherwise unable to do so. 
D.  That the California Penal Code Section 830.6 (a) (2) provides that a city reserve police officer designated by local ordinance, either individually or by class, that is assigned to the prevention and detection of crime and the general enforcement of the laws of this state by that authority, and meeting the level I reserve officer designation is a peace officer. 
E.  That California Penal Code Section 832.6 (a) sets forth three classifications of reserve officers varying from reserve officer I, which carries full police authority to reserve officer III, which allows for the performance of limited duties not requiring general law enforcement powers in their routine work. 
F.  That the City of Anderson Police Department can benefit from the presence of a reserve officer program by maintaining a consistent presence of proactive policing methods.

A.  Initial Appointments at the Beginning of a Term. Each councilmember, upon first entering office or beginning a new term of office, shall be eligible to nominate an individual to be a planning commissioner if such nomination is made in a timely manner. The procedure for filling such a position is that set forth below for the filling of vacancies.

C.  Procedure to Fill Vacancies.

As soon as a vacancy occurs, the public shall be notified in the manner required by law (Maddy Act) and a period of not less than twenty-one days shall be provided for interested persons to submit applications to the city clerk requesting appointment to the position. The city clerk will then schedule an interview process for all those who have submitted timely applications and the entire city council, with the assistance of planning staff, will be allowed an opportunity to interview candidates and discuss their qualifications. In accordance with the open meeting requirements of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the council will neither make a decision nor reach a concurrence about the appointment before the meeting at which a nomination is presented to them by the eligible councilmember. 
2.  Within thirty days following the completion of interviews, the councilmember who is eligible to make a nomination to fill the vacancy shall do so by placing the name and qualifications of his or her selection on a regular agenda by the Wednesday preceding the council meeting at which the appointment is to be considered. If he or she fails to place a nomination on the agenda within this period of time, or any extensions allowed by the council, any other councilmember shall be entitled to nominate a person to fill the vacancy. 
3.  If a councilmember is eligible to make a nomination and does so in a timely manner, but his or her nominee is not approved by the council, he or she shall be eligible to continue making nominations from among the applicants who have been interviewed until such time as a nominee is approved. In the event a nominee is disapproved by the council, the councilmember who is eligible to continue making nominations shall have an additional thirty days following each such disapproval to place a new nomination on the council agenda. 
4.  The council retains the authority at any time to readvertise the position, conduct new interviews and go through the entire process again if it deems it appropriate to do so.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 785, adopted March 4, 2014, was approved by majority vote at an election held June 3, 2014, and established rates operative Oct. 1, 2014. 

3.38.010 - Purpose. 
    The ordinance from which this chapter is derived is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes: 
A.  To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt the tax ordinance from which this chapter is derived, which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose. 
B.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. 
C.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefore that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California state sales and use taxes. 
D.  To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provisions of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and, at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 785, § 4(Exh. A), 3-4-2014) 
3.38.020 - Contract with state. 
    Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax chapter; provided that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract.

    For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. 
(Ord. No. 785, § 4(Exh. A), 3-4-2014)

Chapter 3.40 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX* 

3.40.010 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to July 1, 1965 may be considered. 
(Prior code § 21.21) 
3.40.020 - Imposition-Payment. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the city clerk shall require that such tax be paid directly to the city clerk. 
(Ord. 624 § 1, 1994; Ord. 608 § 1, 1993; Ord. 377 § 1, 1977; prior code § 21.22)

3.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

(Prior code § 21.23) 
3.40.040 - Collection-Operator's duties. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator or that it will not be added to the rent or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in Section 3.40.150. 
(Prior code § 21.24) 
3.40.050 - Transient occupancy registration certificate. 
    Within thirty days after July 1, 1965, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the city clerk and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the City Clerk for the purpose of collection from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the City Clerk. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Prior code § 21.25) 
3.40.060 - Reporting and remitting. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the city clerk, make a return to the city clerk, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be emitted to the city clerk. The city clerk may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the city clerk. 
(Prior code § 21.26) 
3.40.070 - Penalty-Original delinquency.

(Prior code § 21.27(b)) 
3.40.090 - Penalty-Fraud. 
    If the city clerk determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in Sections 3.40.070 and 3.40.080. 
(Prior code § 21.27(c)) 
3.40.100 - Interest on delinquent taxes. 
    In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(Prior code § 21.27(d)) 
3.40.110 - Interest and penalty merged with tax. 
    Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of Section 3.40.100 shall become a part of the tax required to be paid by this chapter. 
(Prior code § 21.27(e)) 
3.40.120 - Determination of tax by city clerk-Hearing. 
    If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the city clerk shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city clerk procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the city clerk shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last-known place of address. Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the city clerk for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the city clerk shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the city clerk shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties shall not be so fixed.

    An applicant for a permit to keep, breed, maintain and/or fly pigeons shall certify on a form provided by the city that he or she is in full compliance with all of the conditions provided above and that his or her loft(s) complies with applicable building and zoning codes. Upon satisfactory proof thereof, the police chief or his or her designee shall issue a permit.

    In the event the city receives any written complaint arising out of the keeping, breeding, maintaining or flying of pigeons which relates to a property for which a permit has been issued, a hearing shall be scheduled either before the planning commission or its designee to consider the revocation or further conditioning of such permit.

    The failure to comply with an administrative order revoking the permit and ordering the pigeons to be removed from the property, or to comply with whatever conditions are imposed if the permit remains in effect, authorizes the animal control officer to enter upon the premises, after notice duly provided to the owners and occupants thereof, and to remove the pigeons to a place of safekeeping at the expense of the person who held the permit. Such pigeons will only be released to such person after he or she has paid the applicable fees and upon his or her certification that the pigeons will be removed from the city and not returned without such person first having obtained a new permit to allow them to be returned to the city.

Any owner found violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall upon conviction be guilty of an infraction punishable as set forth in Section 1.20.010 of this code.

(Ord. No. 787, § 4, 6-3-2014) 
8.14.020 - Contents of warning. 
    The written warning shall state that if police department personnel are required to return to the location of the event or must recontact the person in the event, or if there are continuing complaints from other persons, or if police personnel observe continuing violations within the following twenty-four-hour period and the responding personnel determine that the subsequent event is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, each such response shall constitute the provision of special security services. The warning shall state that the person receiving the warning may be charged for the cost of the city providing such special security services for the event or response to issues caused by that/those person(s). An event requiring over thirty minutes of cumulative on-site police officer time on the initial response may also result in a fee covering cost of police services.

Chapter 8.15 - SOCIAL HOSTS-CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES BY MINORS 

8.15.010 - Findings and intent. 
A.  Minors often obtain, possess, or consume alcoholic beverages at parties held on private property under the control of a person who knows or should know of such conduct but fails to stop it. 
B.  Law enforcement responses to disturbances involving underage consumption of alcoholic beverages at private parties frequently require the use of extensive resources. Further, when law enforcement personnel respond to disturbances at private parties, it limits their ability to respond to other service calls in the community, thereby placing the community at increased risk. Law enforcement is not currently reimbursed for their expenses when called to a private party. 
C.  The prohibitions found in this chapter are reasonable and expected to deter the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors by holding responsible persons who encourage, are aware of, or should be aware of, the illegal conduct yet fail to prevent it. In addition, the revenue received by the county after cost reimbursement will be directed toward alcohol abuse and prevention education programs in the community. 
(Ord. No. 787, § 5, 6-3-2014) 
8.15.020 - Social host defined. 
    A "social host" is a person who permits a party where one or more minors consume one or more alcoholic beverages on property owned or controlled by the persons. 
(Ord. No. 787, § 5, 6-3-2014) 
8.15.030 - Prohibition. 
A.  No person who owns or controls private property shall allow a party to take place or continue on such private property if a minor at the party obtains, possesses, or consumes any alcoholic beverage and the person knows or reasonably should know, by taking all reasonable steps to prevent alcoholic beverage consumption by the minor as described in subsection B of this section, that the minor has obtained, possesses, or is consuming alcoholic beverages at the party. 
B.  It is the duty of any person having control of any private property, who knowingly hosts, permits or allows a gathering on the property to take all reasonable steps to prevent the consumption of alcoholic beverages by any minor at the gathering. Reasonable steps include, but are not limited to, (i) controlling access to alcoholic beverages, (ii) controlling the quantity of alcoholic beverages, (iii) verifying the age of persons at the gathering by inspecting drivers' licenses or other government-issued identification cards, and (iv) supervising the activities of minors at the gathering. 
(Ord. No. 787, § 5, 6-3-2014) 
8.15.040 - Prima facie evidence. 
    Whenever a person having control of the residence or premises is present at that residence or premises at the time that a minor obtains, possesses, or consumes any alcoholic beverage, it shall be prima facie evidence that such person had the knowledge or should have had the knowledge that the minor obtained, possessed, or consumed an alcoholic beverage at the party. 
(Ord. No. 787, § 5, 6-3-2014) 
8.15.050 - Enforcement remedies. 
A.  Any person who violates Section 8.15.030 of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
B.  Any person who sells, furnishes, gives, or causes to be sold, furnished, or given away, any alcoholic beverage to a minor is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
C.  Any person who violates subsection A, above, by purchasing an alcoholic beverage for a minor and the minor thereafter consumes the alcohol and thereby proximately causes great bodily injury or death to himself, herself, or any other person, is guilty of a misdemeanor. 
D.  Any person who violates subsection A by furnishing an alcoholic beverage, or causing an alcoholic beverage to be furnished, to a minor shall be punished by a fine of one thousand dollars, no part of which shall be suspended, and the person shall be required to perform not less than twenty-four hours of community service during hours when the person is not employed and is not attending school. 
E.  Any person who violates subsection B shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for a minimum term of six months not to exceed one year, by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by both imprisonment and fine. 
F.  Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1714.1, any act of willful misconduct of a minor that results in injury or death to another person or in injury to the property of another shall be imputed to the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor for all purposes of civil damages, and the parent or guardian having custody and control shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for any damages resulting from the willful misconduct. 
G.  A social host who serves alcoholic beverages to a minor guest may be held liable for injuries sustained by third parties, including city law enforcement personnel, as a result of the minor guest's negligence. 
H.  A social host shall be liable for the cost of providing enforcement services in response to a party in which minors have obtained, possessed, or consumed alcoholic beverages. Such costs include reasonable attorneys' fees in the event of litigation.

8.28.040 - Notice to abate. 
A.  In General. Whenever any property is found by the code enforcement officer to contain a public nuisance as declared by this chapter, he or she shall notify the owner of such property in writing by issuing a notice to abate. The notice shall state the conditions which constitute the public nuisance, and shall order the owner to abate said conditions within thirty days after the date of notice. The notice may provide for a shorter period of time in which to abate the public nuisance in the event that (1) the condition which constitutes the public nuisance is not one which makes the property substandard housing as defined by Health and Safety Code section 17920.3, or (2) prior notices to abate the same condition have been sent within the last ninety days and the condition has not been abated. 
B.  Substandard Housing. Whenever the condition which constitutes a nuisance is a substandard residential building, as defined by Health and Safety Code section 17920.3, then the notice to abate required by this section shall be sent not only to the owner, but also to any mortgagee or beneficiary under any deed of trust of record. The notice shall state the conditions which render the building unfit for human habitation and shall order the building or the affected portion of it vacated, and further order that it be either repaired or demolished within thirty days after the date of notice. 
If such building is encumbered by a mortgage or deed of trust of record, and the owner does not comply with the notice to abate on or before the expiration of thirty days after its mailing and posting, the mortgagee or beneficiary may, within fifteen days after the expiration of said thirty-day period, comply with the requirements of the notice to abate, in which event the cost of the mortgagee or beneficiary in so doing shall be added to and become a part of the lien secured by the mortgage or deed of trust and shall be payable as provided by Title 25 of the Code of California Regulations, section 54. 
C.  Manner of Giving Notice. 
1.  General. The notices shall be mailed by certified U.S. mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to the owner of the property at the address for the owner shown on the last equalized assessment roll of Shasta County. The names and addresses of owners appearing on the assessment roll shall be conclusively deemed to be the proper person and address for the purpose of mailing such notices. In addition, if the property is other than vacant property, a copy of the notice shall be mailed to the property address. 
2.  Substandard housing. Whenever the condition which constitutes a nuisance also constitutes a substandard residential building, as defined by Health and Safety Code section 17920.3, then at least one copy of the notice to abate shall be posted conspicuously on the building alleged to be substandard; and an additional copy shall be mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, to any mortgagee or beneficiary on any note or deed of trust of record. If the address of a mortgagee or beneficiary is unknown, then that fact shall be stated on the copy so mailed, and the notice to abate shall be sent to the mortgagee or beneficiary addressed to him or her at Redding, California. 
3.  Affidavits. The employee sending such notice to abate shall file an affidavit with the city clerk certifying the time and manner in which notice was given and shall also file with the city clerk any receipt card returned in acknowledgment of the notice to abate. 
4.  Failure to Receive Notice. The failure of any owner or other person to receive the notice to abate or other notices required by this chapter shall not affect in any manner the validity of any proceeding taken under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 775, § 5(Exh. B), 9-6-2011)

The order to show cause shall be served and posted, and an affidavit filed with the city clerk, in the manner specified in Section 8.28.040.

8.28.090 - Waiver of abatement hearing. 
    Failure of the owner or responsible party to either abate the conditions specified in the Order to Show Cause or to appear at the hearing on the Order to Show Cause after notice has been served shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission by such owner or responsible party of the existence of the nuisance conditions as specified. In the event of an unexcused failure to appear, the hearing officer may issue an Order of Abatement permitting the conditions to be abated by the city . Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, there shall be no right to appeal such order following both a failure to appear and a failure to abate.

No person shall obstruct, impede or interfere with any officer, employee, contractor or authorized representative of the city whenever such person is engaged in the work of abatement, or in performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work, as authorized or directed pursuant to this chapter. The cost, including incidental expenses, of abating the nuisance shall become a civil debt of the owner and other responsible persons and shall be billed to the owner and become due and payable fifteen days thereafter.

A.  Notice. The enforcement officer shall attempt to make contact through a personal interview, or by telephone, with the landowner or the person, if any, occupying or otherwise in real or apparent charge and control thereof. The enforcement officer shall document all attempts to make contact. In the event contact is made, the enforcement officer shall notify such person or persons of the danger involved and require that such condition be immediately removed, repaired or isolated so as to preclude harm to any person or property. 
B.  Abatement. In the event the enforcement officer is unable to make contact as required by this section, or if the appropriate persons, after notification by the enforcement officer, do not take action as specified by such official within seventy-two hours, or a lesser period if deemed necessary, then the enforcement officer may, with the approval of the city manager and in consultation with the city attorney if feasible, take all steps necessary to remove or isolate such dangerous condition, or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor retained pursuant to the provisions of this code. Provided, however, that summary abatement shall be limited solely to those matters which are imminently dangerous to life or other property, and additional abatement, if necessary, shall utilize the other enforcement provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Costs. The enforcement officer shall keep an itemized account of the costs incurred by the city in removing or isolating such condition or conditions. Such costs may be recovered to the same extent and in the same manner that abatement costs incurred pursuant Section 8.28.120 are recovered.

(Ord. No. 775, § 5(Exh. B), 9-6-2011) 
8.28.160 - Violation unlawful. 
    In addition to any other remedies provided for in this chapter or under applicable law, violation of this chapter or a failure to comply with an order of abatement or notice to abate issued pursuant to this chapter shall be unlawful and an offense.

The city envisions that this chapter will be enforced, in the city's prosecutorial discretion, only as to a limited number of problem properties, as resources permit. Nothing in this section or the absence of any similar provisions from any other city law shall be construed to impose a duty on the city to enforce such other provision of law. This chapter is not intended to and shall not be construed or given effect in a manner that imposes upon the city or any officer or employee thereof a mandatory duty of care towards persons and property within or without the city so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages, except as otherwise imposed by law.

8.29.080 - Special assessment procedure. 
A.  The code enforcement officer or other authorized city official shall keep an itemized report of the costs incurred by the city in the abatement of any public nuisance in addition to any accrued fees and penalties due. The property owner may be invoiced for the total. If payment is not received, the itemized report shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk no sooner than fifteen days of the invoice date. Any such report may include the abatement costs, fees and penalties for any number of properties and abatements whether or not such properties are contiguous. 
B.  Upon receipt of the itemized report, the city clerk shall serve notice by certified mail, to the property owner, if the property owner's identity can be determined from the county assessor's or county recorder's records. The notice shall be given at the time of imposing the assessment and shall specify that the property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
C.  Subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property pursuant to Section 3691 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the city may conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment of that assessment is delinquent. 
D.  Notices or instruments relating to the special assessment shall be entitled to recordation.

(Ord. 444 § 2 (part), 1981; Ord. 373 § 2 (part), 1977) 
8.30.060 - Noise measurement procedure. 
A.  Upon receipt of a complaint from a citizen, the noise-control officer or his agent, equipped with sound level measurement equipment satisfying the requirements specified in Section 8.30.020, shall investigate the complaint. The investigation shall consist of a measurement and the gathering of data to adequately define the noise problem and shall include the following nonacoustic data: 
1.  The type of noise source; 
2.  Location of the noise source relative to the complainant's property; 
3.  Time period during which the noise source is considered by the complainant to be intrusive; 
4.  Total duration of noise produced by the noise source; 
5.  Date and time of the noise measurement survey. 
B.  The procedure to be followed for measuring noise shall be as follows: Utilizing the A-weighting scale of the sound level meter and the "slow" meter response (use "fast" response for impulsive-type sound), the noise level shall be measured at a position or positions at any point on the receiver's property. In general, the microphone shall be located four to five feet from above the ground and ten feet or more from the nearest reflective surface, where possible; however, in those cases where another elevation is deemed appropriate, the latter shall be made within the affected residential unit. The measurements shall be made at a point at least four feet from the wall, ceiling or floor nearest the noise source, with windows in the normal seasonal configuration. Calibration of the measurement equipment, utilizing an acoustic calibrator, shall be performed immediately prior to recording any noise data. 
(Ord. 373 §2 (part), 1977) 
8.30.070 - Maximum permissible exterior noise levels. 
A.  The noise standards for the various categories of land use identified by the noise-control officer as presented in Table 7-1 of subsection F of this section shall, unless otherwise specifically indicated, apply to all such property within a designated zone. 
B.  No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound at any location within the incorporated city or allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or otherwise controlled by such person which causes the noise level when measured on any other property, either incorporated or unincorporated, to exceed: 
1.  The noise standard for that land use (the receiving land use) as specified in Table 7-1 of subsection F of this section for a cumulative period of more than thirty minutes in an hour; 
2.  The noise standard plus five dB for a cumulative period of more than fifteen minutes in an hour; 
3.  The noise standard plus ten dB for a cumulative period of more than five minutes in an hour; 
4.  The noise standard plus fifteen dB for a cumulative period of more than one minute in an hour; or 
5.  The noise standard plus twenty dB or the maximum measured ambient for any period of time. 
C.  If the measured ambient level exceeds that permissible within any of the first four noise limit categories in subsection B of this section, the allowable noise standard shall be increased in five dB increments in each category as appropriate to encompass or reflect said ambient noise level. In the event the ambient noise level exceeds the fifth noise limit category designated in subsection B of this section, the maximum allowable noise level under this category shall be increased to reflect the maximum ambient noise level. 
D.  If the measurement location is on a boundary between two different zones, the noise level limit applicable to the lower noise zone plus five dB shall apply. 
E.  If possible, the ambient noise shall be measured at the same location along the property line utilized in subsection B of this section, with the alleged offending noise source inoperative. If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise must be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance such that the noise from the source is at least ten dB below the ambient in order that only the ambient level is measured. If the difference between the ambient and the noise source is five to ten dB, then the level of the ambient itself can be reasonably determined by subtracting a one-decibel correction to account for the contribution of the source. 
F.  Correction for Character of Sound. In the event the alleged offensive noise contains a steady, audible tone such as a whine, screech or hum, or is a repetitive noise such as hammering or riveting, or contains music or speech conveying informational content, the standard limits set forth in Table 7-1 shall be reduced by five dB. 
    The classification of different areas of the community in terms of environmental noise zones shall be determined by the noise-control officer as approved by resolution of the city council based upon assessments of community noise survey data. Additional area classifications should be as appropriate, to reflect both lower and higher existing ambient levels than those shown. Industrial noise limits are intended primarily for use at the boundary of industrial zones rather than for noise reduction within the zone.

A.  Special Variances. 
1.  The NCO is authorized to grant variances for exception from any provision of this chapter, subject to limitations as to area, noise levels, time limits and other terms and conditions as the NCO determines are appropriate to protect public health, safety and welfare from the noise emanating therefrom. This section shall in no way affect the duty to obtain any permit or license required by law for such activities. 
2.  Any person seeking a variance pursuant to this section shall file an application with the NCO. The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity for which the variance is sought into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community or on other persons. A separate application shall be filed for each noise source; provided, however, that several mobile sources under common ownership or several fixed sources on a single property may be combined into one application. Notice of an application for a variance shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least ten days prior to the granting of the variance. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the variance may file a statement with the NCO containing any information to support his claim. If at any time the NCO finds that a sufficient controversy exists regarding an application, a public hearing will be held with notice of such hearing published as provided for in this subdivision. 
3.  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the NCO shall balance the hardship on the applicant, the community and other persons of not granting the variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the variance. Applicants for variances and persons contesting variances may be required to submit such information as the NCO may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the NCO shall keep on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the variance. 
4.  Variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the variance shall terminate the variance and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this chapter for which the variance was granted. 
5.  A variance will not exceed three hundred sixty-five days from the date on which it was granted. Applications for extension of time limits specified in variances or for modification or other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial variances under subdivision 2 of this subsection. 
6.  The NCO will issue guidelines pursuant to Section 8.30.040, approved by the city council, defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a variance. 
B.  Variances for Time to Comply. 
1.  Within ninety days following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the owner of any commercial or industrial source of sound may apply to the NCO for a variance in time to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

B.  Violations. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of an infraction and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as specified in Section 1.20.010 of this code.

No complaint or further action shall be taken in the event that the cause of the violation has been removed, the condition abated or fully corrected within the time period specified in the written notice. 
D.  Notice of Violation. Except where a person is acting in good faith to comply with an abatement order issued pursuant to subsection C of this section, violation of any provision of this chapter shall be cause for a notice of violation to be issued by the NCO or other responsible enforcement official according to procedures which the NCO may prescribe. 
E.  Violations-Additional Remedies-Injunctions. As an additional remedy, the operation or maintenance of any device, instrument, vehicle or machinery in violation of any provision of this chapter, which operation or maintenance causes or creates sound levels or vibration exceeding the allowable limits as specified in this chapter, is a public nuisance and may be subject to abatement summarily by a restraining order or injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Additionally, no provision of this chapter shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory cause of action, or legal remedy therefrom, of any person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this chapter or from other law.

Chapter 9.16 - DRUG PARAPHERNALIA 

9.16.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The illegal use of controlled substances within the city creates serious social, medical and law enforcement problems. The illegal use of such substances by persons under eighteen years of age has reached serious dimensions. It is causing serious physical and psychological damage to the youth of this community, an impairment of educational achievement and of the efficiency of the educational system, increases in non-drug-related crime, and a threat to the ability of the community to ensure future generations of responsible and productive adults, all to the detriment of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
B.  The proliferation of the display of drug paraphernalia in retail stores within the city, and the distribution of such paraphernalia will intensify and otherwise compound the problem of illegal use of controlled substances within this community. 
C.  A ban only upon the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia to persons under eighteen years of age would not be practical. The person who displays or distributes would have difficulty determining who could lawfully view or receive drug paraphernalia. The already thinly staffed law enforcement agencies would be subjected to added enforcement burdens by adding age of a person who views or receives paraphernalia as an element of a prohibition upon display and distribution. A significant number of high school students are eighteen years of age or older. It would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited. Permitted display and distribution to adults within the community would symbolize a public tolerance of illegal drug use, making it difficult to explain the rationale of programs directed against similar abuse by youth. The problem of illegal consumption of controlled substances by adults within this community is significant and substantial, necessitating a cessation of the encouragement to drug abuse which the display and distribution of drug paraphernalia create. 
D.  This chapter is a measure which is necessary in order to discourage the illegal use of controlled substances within the city. 
(Ord. 447 § 1 (part), 1981)

Chapter 9.17 - BUTANE RESALE ORDINANCE[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 800, § 1, adopted July 19, 2016, repealed the former ch. 9.17, §§ 9.17.010-9.17.090, and enacted a new ch. 9.17 as set out herein. The former ch. 9.17 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 793, § 1, adopted Dec. 1, 2015. 

9.17.010 - Authority and title. 
    Under the authority granted in Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution and Government Code Sections 36900 and 36901, the City of Anderson, by and through its council, does enact this chapter of its Municipal Code, which shall be known as the Butane Resale Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 800, § 1, 7-19-2016) 
9.17.020 - Findings and purpose. 
    The northern region of our state has experienced a recent increase in explosions caused from the manufacture of honey oil (also known as hash oil) in clandestine labs using refined butane of five times and higher. These incidents have caused considerable property damage, personal injury and even incidents of death to those participating in the manufacturing process, and to innocent bystanders. 
    Use of refined butane five times or higher is done to dissolve the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) resin, which concentrates into a liquid/oil form as a result of the butane's stripping process. The stripping of the THC through use of refined butane causes flammable butane vapors to accumulate low to the ground and remain exposed to ignition sources. Studies suggest that ninety-nine and one-half percent of the extracted THC butane mixture will volatilize into the immediate area and find an ignition source if five times refined and higher is used. 
    That the honey oil lab using refined butane of five times and higher presents a serious hazard for first responders as the gas has no odor and can only be detected by a combustible gas instrument. Such conditions present grave risk of loss where devices such as a TASER are capable of igniting the gas resulting in an explosion. 
    That the resale of refined butane five times and higher occurs at levels sufficient to aid the manufacture of honey oil. That such sales and possession of butane should be regulated to prevent the use of butane in the manufacture of honey oil where such activity presents grave dangers to the occupants of the city and the first responders therein.

    The council finds and declares: 
A.  The groundwater underlying the city of Anderson has historically provided the people and lands of Anderson with water for agriculture, domestic, municipal/industrial and other purposes; 
B.  The council recognizes that the principle of California law that water may be extracted from a groundwater basin if the groundwater basin is in a surplus condition and such extraction would not impair the reasonable and beneficial needs of overlying users; 
C.  It is essential for the protection of the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the city, that the groundwater basin over which the city lies be protected from harm resulting from the extraction of groundwater for use on lands outside of the city, until such time as needed additional water supplies are obtained for use on the lands of the city, or as further and more accurate quantification of groundwater resources within the city is developed and groundwater management plans for the affected basin have been adopted; 
D.  Much of the economic production of the city depends upon the use of groundwater; 
E.  The groundwater used by the city provides all of the water for domestic uses throughout the city; 
F.  The groundwater used by the city has been and will continue to be a vital part of the economic well-being and stability of the city; 
G.  Because of the need for increased water supply to meet future needs within the city, it is vital that the city's groundwater supply and quality be preserved; 
H.  It is essential for information gathering and monitoring purposes, and for the protection of the city's groundwater resources, that the city adopt a permit process addressing the extraction of groundwater for use outside of the city; and 
I.  In adopting and codifying this groundwater management ordinance the city does not intend to limit other authorized means of managing Anderson groundwater, and intends to work cooperatively with interested local agencies to further develop and implement joint groundwater management practices.

    The permit may only be granted if there is a majority of the total membership of the council present at the required public meeting and a majority of the total membership of the council finds that the proposed groundwater extraction will not have significant detrimental impacts on the affected groundwater basin by determining that: 
A.  The proposed extraction will not cause or increase an overdraft of the groundwater underlying the city; 
B.  The proposed extraction will not adversely affect the long term ability for storage or transmission of groundwater within the aquifer; 
C.  The proposed extraction (together with other extractions) will not exceed the annual yield of groundwater underlying the city unless the safe yield is exceeded only by extractions in connection with a conjunctive use program approved by council and will not otherwise operate to the injury of or the reasonable and beneficial uses of the overlying groundwater users; 
D.  The proposed extraction will not result in an injury to a water replenishment, storage, or restoration project operating in accordance with statutory authorization; 
E.  The proposed extraction is in compliance with California Water Code Section 1220; and 
F.  The proposed extraction will not be otherwise detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of property owners overlying or in the vicinity of the proposed extraction site(s). 
    If the council determines that one or more of the findings required by this section cannot be made, upon considering the proposed export together with potential conditions of permit issuance, it shall deny the permit application. The basis for any such denial shall be reflected in the city's official record of proceedings. 
    The applicant shall be notified in writing of the council's decision on the application, including the basis for denial where applicable, within fifteen days of the final council action on the application.

The objectives of the ordinance codified in Chapters 13.76 through 13.88 are: 
1.  To provide revenue for the operation of the existing sewer system of the city; 
2.  To provide funds for the replacement and extension thereof; 
3.  To provide funds for the maintenance and operation of additions to the system now being and to be constructed; 
4.  To provide for regulation of discharges into the system; 
5.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or contaminate the resulting sludge; 
6.  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the system; 
7.  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and sludges from the system; 
8.  To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public; 
9.  To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is subject. 
B.  The ordinance codified in Chapters 13.76 to 13.88 provides for the regulation of direct and indirect contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general requirements of the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customer's capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
C.  The ordinance codified in Chapters 13.76 to 13.88 shall apply to the city and to persons outside the city who are, by contract or agreement with the city, users of the city wastewater treatment works. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director of public works and/or the superintendent of the wastewater division shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of the ordinance codified in Chapters 13.76 to 13.88. 
D.  No provision of this chapter shall be so construed as to require the city to extend its sewer system to any area within the corporate limits of the city not now served by the existing sewer system.

A.  General Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other federal, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
B.  Specific Prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances or wastewater: 
1.  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system) be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hybrids and sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. Any wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than one hundred forty degrees F. (sixty degrees C.) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR Section 261.21; 
2.  Wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or more than 8.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
3.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference (but in no case solids greater than two inches or 5.08 centimeters in any dimension); 
4.  Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.) released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than fifteen minutes more than five times the average twenty-four hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation; 
5.  Wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed one hundred four degrees F. (forty degrees C.); 
6.  Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under Section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used; 
7.  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters or the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Act; 
8.  Trucked or hauled pollutants; 
9.  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
10.  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit; 
11.  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such halflife or concentration(s) as may exceed limits established by the city in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. See Section 13.76.100(E) for limitations; 
12.  Sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes; 
13.  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the department in a wastewater discharge permit; 
14.  Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards or have a detrimental environmental impact or a nuisance in the waters of the state or a condition unacceptable to any public agency having regulatory jurisdiction over the city; 
15.  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
16.  Detergents, surface-active agents or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
17.  Wastewater containing in excess of 0.02 mg/L total identifiable chlorinated hydrocarbons which cannot be removed by the city's wastewater treatment process;

19.  Wastewater in quantities or rates of flow which overload the city's collection or treatment facilities or cause excessive city collection or treatments costs, or may use a disproportionate share of the city facilities; 
20.  Wastewater which causes air pollution by the release of toxic or malodorous gases or malodorous gas-producing substances. 
C.  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits: 
0.15 mg/L arsenic **** mg/L benzene **** mg/L beryllium 0.20 mg/L cadmium 2.00 mg/L copper 1.00 mg/L cyanide 1.00 mg/L lead 0.01 mg/L mercury 1.0 mg/L nickel **** mg/L selenium 0.20 mg/L silver 0.50 mg/L total chromium 1.00 mg/L total petroleum hydrocarbons 3.00 mg/L zinc **** No local limits have been established.  
    The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The department may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
D.  Effluent limitations promulgated by the Federal Act shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent than those in this chapter and Chapters 13.80 to 13.88. Under Section 307(b) of the Act, federal pretreatment standards are designed to achieve two purposes: 
1.  To protect the operation of publicly owned treatment works; 
2.  To prevent the discharge of pollutants which pass through such works inadequately treated. 
E.  The following additional conditions shall apply to wastewater discharge unless otherwise authorized by special permit and payment of appropriate fees: 
1.  Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). The average COD concentration of discharged wastes shall not exceed five hundred twenty-five mg/L. 
2.  Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). The average BOD concentration of discharged wastes shall not exceed three hundred mg/L. 
3.  Total Solids. The average concentration of total solids shall not exceed eight hundred mg/L. 
4.  Suspended Solids. The average concentration of suspended solids shall not exceed three hundred mg/L.

6.  Total Dissolved Solids. The average concentration of total dissolved solids shall not exceed 500 mg/L. 
F.  State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this division. 
G.  The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in Section 13.76.010 of this chapter. Specific effluent limits shall not be developed and enforced without individual notice to persons or groups who have requested such notice and an opportunity to respond. 
H.  No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state. (Comment: Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in Section 13.76.080(B)(2), e.g. the pH prohibition.) 
I.  Any wastewater containing pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
J.  When the city determines that a user(s) is contributing to the POTW, any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the city shall: 
1.  Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; 
2.  Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user(s) to correct the interference with the POTW.

B.  All grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the uniform mechanical and plumbing codes and other standards adopted by the city. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the department and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
C.  Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation. 
D.  The city may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter and Chapters 13.80 to 13.88 are being met and all requirements are being complied with. All such inspections shall be carried out in accordance with Chapter 1.12 of this code. Sampling points shall be so located that they are safe and accessible to city inspectors at any reasonable time. 
E.  All interceptor facilities shall be subject to a minimum yearly inspection but maintenance and operating conditions may dictate a more frequent schedule. Inspection and monitoring fees chargeable under this section shall be the responsibility of the owner and shall be paid to the city on the basis of actual cost, plus fifteen percent, for all services furnished by the city. The city shall furnish a statement of all charges for services performed and payment of such charges shall be completed within ten days after receipt thereof. 
F.  No person shall discharge wastewater: 
1.  Containing more than forty mg/L of oil or grease of animal or vegetable origin;

(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 318 § 1(B) (part), 1974) 
13.76.100 - Discharge of industrial and commercial waste. 
A.  Limitations on Point of Discharge. No person shall discharge any substances directly into a manhole or other opening in a community sewer other than through an approved building sewer, unless, upon written application by the user and payment of the applicable user charges and fees, the city issues a permit for such direct discharges. 
B.  Holding Tank Waste. A user proposing to discharge holding tank waste into a community sewer must secure a permit. Unless allowed by the city under the terms and conditions of the permit, a separate permit must be secured for each separate discharge. This permit will state the specific location of discharge, the time of day the discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge and the waste-water constituents and characteristics. If a permit is granted for discharge of such waste into a community sewer, the user shall pay the applicable user charges and fees and shall meet such other conditions as required by the city. This subsection shall apply to trailer disposal facilities. 
C.  Limitations on the Users of Garbage Grinders. 
1.  Waste from garbage grinders shall not be discharged into a sanitary sewer except: 
a.  Wastes generated in preparation of food normally consumed on the premises; or 
b.  Where the user has obtained a permit for that specific use from the city, and agrees to undertake whatever self-monitoring is required to enable the city to equitably determine the user charges based on the waste constituents and characteristics. 
2.  Such grinders must shred the waste to a degree that all particles will be carried freely under normal flow conditions prevailing in the community sewer. Garbage grinders shall not be used for grinding plastic, paper products, inert materials or garden refuse without written permission from the city. 
D.  Limitations on Radioactive Wastes. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any radioactive waste into a community sewer except: 
1.  When the person is authorized to use radioactive materials by the State Department of Health or other governmental agency empowered to regulate the use of radioactive materials; 
2.  When the waste is discharged in strict conformity with current California Radiation Control Regulations (California Administrative Code, Title 17), and the Atomic Energy Commission regulations and recommendations for safe disposal; and 
3.  When the person is in compliance with all rules and regulations of all other applicable regulatory agencies. 
E.  Pretreatment Standards. Pretreatment requirements shall be in accordance with sewer standards promulgated by the department of public works. 
F.  Monitoring Facilities. 
1.  The city may require the user to construct, at his own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems and may also require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
2.  If the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow access for city personnel, such as a gate secured with a city lock. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole(s) to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analyses. The manhole(s), sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
3.  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the city unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. 
G.  Right of Entry. The city engineer and other duly authorized employees of the city may inspect the facilities of any user subject to the provisions of this division, to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter and Chapters 13.80 to 13.88 are being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection or sampling or in the performance of any of their duties. The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
H.  Accidental Discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operation procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this division shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operation procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this division. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
1.  Written Notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the department a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this division or other applicable law. 
2.  Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
I.  Discharge Restriction Provision. Whenever deemed necessary, the department may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this division. 
J.  Flow Equalization. The department may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
K.  Gas Detection Equipment. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, an approved combustible gas detection meter.

13.76.110 - Sewer connections required. 
A.  Private Septic and Sewer Systems. No person or other entity shall install, upgrade or expand a private septic or other type of sewer system within the city limits without first having obtained approval from the city public works department together with a permit granted by the Shasta County health department. The necessary approval and permit may be granted only in those cases where (1) no public sewer is located within two hundred feet of any property line of the premises, or (2) connection to the public sewer is prohibited by law or regulation. When a permit is granted, it shall only continue to be valid as long as the private septic or sewer system does not become a health hazard and only until such time as municipal sewer services are extended to a location within two hundred feet of any property line of the premises. Whenever either of the foregoing circumstances occurs, the permit shall automatically expire and the owner of the property where such private septic or sewer system is located shall immediately be obligated, at his or her sole expense, to abandon the same and connect to the municipal sewer system after paying all applicable charges. 
B.  Abandonment of Existing Private Septic or Sewer Systems. Any property owner who has an existing private septic or sewer system on his or her property at the time of the enactment of the ordinance codified in this section shall not be required to abandon the same unless (1) such septic or sewer system becomes a public health hazard, or (2) the owner elects to connect to the municipal sewer system. If either of the foregoing circumstances occurs, then the owner of the subject property shall immediately abandon the private septic or sewer system in the manner directed by the public works director of the city. 
(Ord. 699, 2000) 
13.76.120 - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in Section 13.76.080 of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state or the department, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the department for review, and shall be acceptable to the department before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.76.130 - Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
A.  Upon the promulgation of a Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard for a particular industrial subcategory, the national standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this division. The department shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR Section 403.12. 
B.  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated: 
1.  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the department may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(c). 
2.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the department shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste-stream formula in 40 CFR Section 403.6(e). 
3.  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR Section 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
4.  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.15. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.76.140 - Ownership of laterals and building sewers. 
    Laterals and building sewers, including the portion in public rights-of-way, shall be owned and maintained by the benefitting property owner. Such laterals and building sewers shall be constructed and maintained pursuant to requirements as established by the department of public works. The minimum size for laterals and building sewers in the city shall be four inches. Replacement and/or repair when deemed necessary by the department shall be a responsibility of the property owner. All cleaning, rodding and maintenance of the lateral(s) and building sewer(s) shall be a responsibility of the property owner. The city staff need not respond to lateral blockages until the property owner has demonstrated that said lateral is free of obstructions, or that other property owners are affected. 
A.  The department of public works may, from time to time, test laterals and building sewers to see if leakage is within limits as may be set by resolution of the city council. Such tests will be made during reasonable times, after an attempt has been made to notify such property owner(s) that tests will be performed and that an interruption of service will occur. 
B.  When leakage is in excess of that prescribed, the property owner shall be subject to make repairs or pay appropriate penalty costs. Excess leakage shall be converted to household equivalents (H.E.) and a penalty fee of two times the normal H.E. cost will be assessed. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.76.150 - Accidental discharge/slug control plans. 
    At least once every two years, the department shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The department may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the department may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
A.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
B.  Description of stored chemicals; 
C.  Procedures for immediately notifying the department of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section 13.80.120(F) of this division; and 
D.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

Chapter 13.82 - SEWER CAPACITY ALLOCATION 

13.82.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish a procedure for allocating remaining capacity in the city's wastewater treatment facility among the various uses of land allowed within the city and authorizing a moratorium on the development of certain types of uses if and when the allocation for a particular type of use is exhausted. It has become necessary to establish such a procedure due to the definitive capacity remaining in the wastewater treatment facility. In order to promote and maintain a balanced growth to uses within the city it is necessary to allocate the remaining capacity among such uses. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 1979) 
13.82.020 - Allocation authorized. 
    Whenever the city council finds that, based upon a report by the city's public works director, the wastewater entering the treatment facility exceeds seventy percent of total plant capacity, the council may adopt by resolution a plan for allocating the remaining capacity among specific categories of new uses within the city. A resolution adopting such plan must include a finding that the allocation being made is in conformity with the provisions of the land use element of the general plan and, in particular, that such allocation will not create an imbalance of uses as is prescribed in the general plan. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994: Ord. 421 § 1 (part), 1979) 
13.82.030 - Moratorium on new development. 
    Whenever the allocations for a particular type of use or for a particular zone, as the case may be, are exhausted, the council may by resolution establish a moratorium on the issuance of building permits for such use or for all cases within such zone. Such moratorium shall remain in effect until modification of or expiration of the sewer allocation plan then in effect.

C.  Notification of Violation. When the department finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the department. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the department to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
D.  Consent Orders. The department may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Section 13.88.070(F) and (G) of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. 
E.  Show Cause Hearing. 
1.  The city may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause before the city council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the city council regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause before the city council why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
2.  The city council may itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or may designate any of its members or any officer or employee of the public works department to: 
a.  Issue in the name of the city council notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings; 
b.  Take the evidence; 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the city council for action thereon. 
3.  At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
4.  After the city council has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
F.  Compliance Orders. When the department finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
G.  Cease and Desist Orders. When the department finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the department may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
1.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
    Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
H.  Administrative Fines. 
1.  When the department finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department may fine such user in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
2.  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after thirty calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one and one-half percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
3.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the department to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within thirty days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the department may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The department may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
4.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
I.  Emergency Suspensions. The department may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The department may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
1.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the department may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The department may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the department that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection J of this section are initiated against the user. 
2.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the department prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection E or J of this section. 
    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
J.  In addition to the provisions in Section 13.80.100 of this division, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
1.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
2.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
3.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
4.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling; or 
5.  Violations of the pretreatment standards in Section 13.76.080 of this division. 
    Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection E of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the department shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.88.080 - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
A.  Injunctive Relief. When the department finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the department may petition the Shasta County municipal court, Anderson branch through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The department may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
B.  Civil Penalties. 
1.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
2.  The department may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
3.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
4.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
C.  Criminal Prosecution. 
1.  A user who wilfully or negligently violates any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
2.  A user who wilfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least one thousand dollars, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
3.  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. 
4.  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 
D.  The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The department may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the department may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the department is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.88.090 - Supplemental enforcement action. 
A.  Performance Bonds. The department may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the department to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
B.  Liability Insurance. The department may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 
C.  Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this division, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the department. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the city code governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.88.100 - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
A.  Upset. 
1.  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
2.  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection C of this section are met. 
3.  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the department within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
i.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
ii.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
iii.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
B.  Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 13.76.080(A) of this division or the specific prohibitions in Section 13.76.080(B) of this division if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
1.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
2.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
C.  Bypass. 
1.  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
2.  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsection (C)(3) and (4) of this section. 
3.  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the department, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the department of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The department may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four hours. 
4.  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the department may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
i.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
ii.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
iii.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (C)(3) of this section. 
b.  The department may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the department determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (C)(4)(a) of this section. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.88.110 - Appeals to council in hardship cases. 
    In the case of unusual topography or unique lot size or shape that results in a disproportionate inequity and hardship in either the application or administration of this chapter and Chapters 13.76 to 13.84, then in such event the person claiming to be aggrieved may make an appeal in the form of a written statement to the city council setting forth his basis for grievance. The city council may consider such appeal upon the merits of the individual case and may take action by motion to give individual treatment to such situation so as to create an equitable result. The action of the council taken upon such individual appeals shall not create a precedent that will bind the council to like subsequent action, except and unless such subsequent appeal be based upon substantially similar facts. 
(Ord. 627A § 1 (part), 1994) 
13.88.120 - Falsifying information. 
    Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both.

B.  Checklist. The Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to develop and adopt a checklist of all requirements with which small rooftop solar energy systems shall comply to be eligible for expedited review. The checklist shall be published on the city's internet website. Permit applicants may submit the permit application and associated documentation to the city's permit center by personal, mailed, or electronic submittal together with any required permit processing and inspection fees. In the case of electronic submittal, the electronic signature of the applicant on all forms, applications and other documentation may be used in lieu of a wet signature. 
C.  Application. Prior to submitting an application, the applicant shall: 
1.  Verify to the applicant's reasonable satisfaction through the use of standard engineering evaluation techniques that the support structure for the small residential rooftop solar energy system is stable and adequate to transfer all wind, seismic, and dead and live loads associated with the system to the building foundation; and 
2.  At the applicant's cost, verify to the applicant's reasonable satisfaction using standard electrical inspection techniques that the existing electrical system including existing line, load, ground and bonding wiring as well as main panel and subpanel sizes are adequately sized, based on the existing electrical system's current use, to carry all new photovoltaic electrical loads. 
D.  Expedited Review. For a small residential rooftop solar energy system eligible for expedited review, only one inspection shall be required, which shall be done in a timely manner and may include a consolidated inspection by the building official and fire chief. If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized; however the subsequent inspection need not conform to the requirements of this subsection. 
E.  Application. An application that satisfies the information requirements in the checklist, as determined by the building official, shall be deemed complete. Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the building official shall issue a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. 
F.  Permit Issuance. Upon confirmation by the building official of the application and supporting documentation being complete and meeting the requirements of the checklist, the building official shall administratively approve the application and issue all required permits. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to connect the small residential rooftop energy system to the Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) electricity grid. The applicant is responsible for obtaining such approval or permission from PG&E.

    The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.030 - Statement of purpose.

A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.040 - Methods of reducing flooding losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.050 - Definitions.

    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of Special Flood Hazard. See "Special flood hazard area." 
    "Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one-hundred-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Building. See "Structure." 
    "Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation, drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood Insurance Study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see "flooding"). 
    "Floodplain Administrator" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations, who shall be the director of planning and community development. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.

    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted. 
    Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.22.090, Variance procedure, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the city council that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship" as related to Section 15.22.090, Variance procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable nonelevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in Section 15.22.080(A)(3)(c), 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.22.080 (A)(1), 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.22.080(A)(2), 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.22.080(B). 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational vehicle. 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
    "New construction" means, for floodplain management purposes, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    One-Hundred-Year Flood or 100-Year Flood. See "Base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.22.090, Variance procedure, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake or river, bay, stream, canal or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal or state financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sand dunes" mean naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach.

    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

15.22.060 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to which this chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of city. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 20, 1995 and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The study and FIRM map are on file at City Hall, Second Floor, 1887 Howard Street, department of planning or public works. 
C.  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the term of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the city from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, the state of California, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
G.  Severability. This chapter and the various parts thereof are declared to be severable. Should any section of this chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.070 - Administration. 
A.  Establishment of Development Permit. A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.22.060(B). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in Zone AO, elevation of highest adjacent grade and proposed elevation of lowest floor of all structures; or 
2.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, if required in Section 15.22.080(C); and 
3.  All appropriate certifications listed in Section 15.22.070(C)(4) of this chapter; and 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
B.  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The director of planning and community development is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. 
C.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 
a.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, 
b.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained, 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding, and 
d.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point; 
2.  Review and Use of Any Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.22.060(B), the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 15.22.080. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
3.  Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation, 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse is maintained; 
4.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
a.  Certification required by Section 15.22.080 (A)(3) (lowest floor elevations), 
b.  Certification required by Section 15.22.080 (A)(3) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures), 
c.  Certification required by Section 15.22.080 (A)(3) (wet floodproofing standard),

e.  Certification required by Section 15.22.080(F) (floodway encroachments); 
5.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.22.090. 
6.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.22.060(C). 
D.  Appeals. The city council of the city shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.080 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  Standards of Construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 15.22.080(D). 
2.  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
a.  With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
b.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
c.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
d.  Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
3.  Elevation and Floodproofing. (See Section 15.22.050 definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement".) 
a.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement: 
i.  In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height one foot above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified, 
ii.  In an A zone, elevated one foot or more above the base flood elevation, as determined by this community, 
iii.  In all other zones, elevated one foot above the base flood elevation; 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.22.080(A)(3)(a) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
i.  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under Section 15.22.080(A)(3)(a) so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, 
ii.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy, and 
iii.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this Section 15.22.080(A)(3)(b) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator; 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect, or 
2.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.22.080(D). 
B.  Standards for Utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
a.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
b.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Standards for Subdivisions. 
1.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
2.  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
4.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
5.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
1.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, on sites located: 
a.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
b.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
c.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood; shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement. 
2.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph 15.22.080(D)(1) will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement, and elevated so that either the: 
a.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least one foot above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
E.  Standards for Recreational Vehicles. 
1.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
b.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.22.070 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.22.080(D). 
F.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.22.060(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If Section 15.22.080(F)(1) is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.22.080. 
(Ord. 664 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1997: Ord. 536 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
15.22.090 - Variance procedure. 
A.  Nature of Variances. 
1.  The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
2.  It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Appeal Board. 
1.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
a.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges. 
2.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Shasta County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
3.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
C.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.22.070 and 15.22.080 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (as defined in Section 15.22.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief: Minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship (as defined in Section 15.22.050 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.22.050 (see "Public safety or nuisance")), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.22.050) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.22.090(C)(1) through (5) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.22.090(B)(1) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

    The city council makes the following findings and determinations required by California Government Code Section 66001 in regard to the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter: 
A.  The city council finds that the presence of park facilities within the city contributes significantly to the beauty and ambience of the city and to the physical health and emotional well-being of its residents. The city council also finds that new residential development occurring within the city will create a need for the acquisition and development of additional park facilities within the city in that the city's existing park facilities are insufficient in number, size, location and the kinds of recreational opportunities which they present to meet the park and recreational needs of both the existing residents of the city plus those additional residents of the city who eventually inhabit such new residential development. In particular, the city council, based on the general plan, finds that new residential development occurring within the city will create the need for at least three acres of neighborhood and community park facilities, developed primarily for active recreational pursuits, for every one thousand new residents who eventually inhabit such new residential development. By reason of the foregoing, the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the park facilities to be funded with the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the residential development upon which such fees are imposed. 
B.  The city council finds that all revenues from the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter will be used for the acquisition and development of additional park facilities within the city which will meet the need for such facilities caused by such new residential development. In particular, the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, all revenues from the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter must be deposited in the park capital improvement fee fund and thereafter appropriated by the city council for the acquisition and development of either neighborhood park facilities or community park facilities of benefit to the persons residing in the residential development upon which the fees are imposed. By reason of the foregoing, the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the residential development upon which such fees are imposed. 
C.  The city council finds that the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development pursuant to the provisions of this chapter will not exceed that which is necessary to fund the park facilities attributable to the new residential development upon which the fees are imposed. In particular, the city council finds that in accordance with the provisions of this chapter the park capital improvement fees assessed and levied on new residential development will be equal to that amount necessary to fund the three acres of neighborhood and community park facilities heretofore found to be necessary for every one thousand new residents which eventually inhabit such new development. By reason of the foregoing, the city council determines that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the park capital improvement fees provided for by this chapter and the cost of the park facilities attributable to the new residential development upon which the fees are imposed.

Chapter 16.14 - STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS 

16.14.010 - Requirements. 
    Except where modified in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, each subdivision and the map thereof shall be in conformity with the standards set forth or referred to in this title. 
(Ord. 338 § 2 (part), 1975) 
16.14.020 - Buildable lots. 
    All subdivisions shall result in the creation of lots which are developable and capable of being built upon. No subdivision shall create lots which are impractical of improvement due to size or shape, location of watercourses or problems of sewage or driveway grades, or other natural physical conditions. 
(Ord. 338 § 2 (part), 1975) 
16.14.030 - Access to public streets. 
    All lots or parcels created by the subdivision of land, except in large lot subdivisions as set forth below, shall have direct access onto a public street improved to the standards hereinafter required. Private streets shall not be permitted. The planning commission may, however, impose a requirement that any dedication or offer of dedication of a street shall include a waiver of direct access rights, including ingress and egress, to such street from any property shown on a final map as abutting thereon, and that if the dedication is accepted, such waiver shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of the waiver of direct access. Whenever the planning commission finds a safety hazard would be created as a result of direct access, it may also require a waiver of direct access to any existing street already dedicated as a condition to approval. As an exemption to the foregoing requirements, the planning commission is authorized to approve large lot subdivisions, with a two-acre minimum lot size, in agricultural and rural estate zones, with some or all of the lots having direct access onto private rather than public streets. Any such approval shall be conditioned on such private streets being developed to the standards hereinafter required and the developer entering into an agreement acceptable to the city which ensures adequate maintenance thereof.

A.  The minimum area and dimension of all lots shall conform to the requirements of the zoning laws of the city for the district in which the subdivision is located, except as otherwise provided by Chapter 16.16 of this title. 
B.  No residential lot shall have a width less than sixty feet at the street frontage, except for: 1) residential lots on curved or cul-de-sac streets, which shall have a minimum street frontage of fifty feet and a minimum width at the established front yard building setback line of fifty feet; and: 2) residential lots located in low density residential (R-1) zone districts limited to the area west of West Center Street, north of South Street, south of First Street and east of the ACID canal where the majority of the existing adjacent lots on the block and across the street have fifty-foot frontage may have a street frontage of fifty feet. 
C.  No lot shall have a depth of less than one hundred feet or an area of less than six thousand square feet. 
D.  The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, shall be at right angles to the street which the lot faces, or approximately radial to the center of curvature, if such street is curved. The side lines of lots shall be approximately radial to the center of the curvature of a cul-de-sac on which the lot faces. 
E.  No lot shall be divided by a city boundary line nor any boundary between parcels registered under separate ownership. Each such boundary line shall be made a lot line. 
F.  Lots having double frontage shall not be approved, except where necessitated by unusual conditions. The width of each block shall be sufficient for an ultimate layout of two tiers of lots therein of a size required by the provisions of this chapter, unless the general layout in the vicinity, lines of ownership, topographical conditions or locations of major streets or freeways justify or make necessary a variation from this requirement. 
G.  Lot numbers shall begin with the numeral "1" and shall continue consecutively through the tract, with no omissions or duplications, and no block designations shall be used. 
H.  No remnants of property shall be left in the subdivision which do not conform to the lot requirements or are not required for a private utility or public purpose.

    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the state of California (hereinafter referred to as the Vesting Tentative Map Statute) and may be cited as the vesting tentative map ordinance. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.020 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the subdivision ordinances contained in this title. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the subdivision ordinances contained in this title shall apply to this chapter. To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.030 - Consistency. 
    No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan, or not permitted by federal or state law and this title or other applicable provisions of this code. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.040 - Definitions. 
    In this chapter: 
A.  "Vesting tentative map" means a tentative map for a residential subdivision, as defined in Section 16.04.030, that has printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map" at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 16.28.050 and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  All other definitions set forth in this title are applicable. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.050 - Application. 
A.  This chapter shall apply only to residential development. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the city subdivision ordinance (Chapters 16.04 through 16.26 of this title) requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
C.  Prior to submittal of a "vesting tentative map" the subdivider is encouraged to consult with the planning department in accordance with Section 16.06.010. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.060 - Filing and processing. 
    A vesting tentative map may be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth elsewhere in this title except as hereinafter provided: 
A.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map." 
B.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed a subdivider shall supply all information as required in Section 16.06.030. 
C.  An environmental impact analysis shall be made pursuant to procedures referenced in Section 16.20.010. For purposes of the time requirements under Section 66452.1 of the Subdivision Map Act, a tentative map shall be deemed not to have been accepted for filing until CEQA review and all related approvals have been obtained. 
D.  A vesting tentative map shall not be accepted for processing until it is consistent with the existing general plan and zoning designation for the subject site. If such inconsistency is found to exist after the map has been accepted for processing, the planning commission may deny the map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.070 - Fees. 
    Upon filing a tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees as established by resolution of the council. These fees may be in addition to the normal charges and fees for any of the following actions: 
A.  Environmental review fees; 
B.  Building/construction fees/permits; 
C.  Building and plan check fees. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.080 - Expiration. 
    The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by this title for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map. 
(Ord. 516 § 1 (part), 1987) 
16.28.090 - Development rights. 
A.  Vesting on Approval of Tentative Map. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map by the planning commission or, on appeal, by the city council, shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Conditioning or Denial. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  Failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  Duration. The rights referred to in this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.28.080. If the final map is approved and recorded these rights shall continue in effect for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial period of time of one year from recordation where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map. This initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that particular phase is recorded. 
2.  The initial time period set forth in subdivision 1 of this subsection shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete and timely application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days from the date such an application is filed. 
3.  A subdivider may apply to the planning commission for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subdivision 1 of this subsection expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the city council within fifteen days of the denial. 
4.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subdivisions 1 or 3 of this subsection, and the permit is thereafter granted, the rights referred to in this section shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.

Chapter 16.30 - PARKLAND DEDICATIONS 

16.30.010 - Parkland dedication requirements. 
A.  Every residential developer or person who develops land for residential purposes shall dedicate a portion of such land, pay a fee or a combination of both, at the option of the city as set forth in this chapter, for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities at the time and according to the standards and formula set forth hereafter. 
B.  The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to alterations or additions to an existing dwelling unit, provided said alterations or additions do not create an additional dwelling unit. The requirement to dedicate land may not be imposed upon subdivisions containing fifty parcels or less unless they are likely to be further subdivided as described hereafter. However, the requirement to pay fees shall apply to such developments. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.020 - Standards for determining the amount of dedicated parkland. 
    The amount of land required to be dedicated to the city for park facilities incident to and as a condition of the approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a subdivision shall be consistent with the standards and policies for park facilities adopted in the city general plan and any applicable specific plan or master plan by the city council; and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the need for park facilities by the inhabitants of the subdivision. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.030 - Maximum amount of dedicated parkland which may be required. 
    Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, the maximum number of acres or fraction of an acre of land required to be dedicated to the city for park facilities incident to and as a condition of the approval of a tentative map or parcel map for a subdivision shall not exceed the product of the following: 
A.  The maximum number of dwelling units permitted within the subdivision as determined from the zoning regulations applicable to the subdivision; multiplied by 
B.  The average number of residents per dwelling unit within the incorporated territory of the city, as determined by the most recent federal census or a census taken pursuant to the provisions of Title 4, Division 3, Part 2 of the California Government Code (commencing with Section 40200); multiplied by 
C.  Three thousandths of an acre (.003 acre) per person. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.040 - Adjustments to maximum amount of dedicated parkland which may be required to account for private open space. 
A.  Where a tentative map or a parcel map is approved for a condominium project, a planned development or a real estate development which includes private open space set aside either for active recreational purposes or passive recreational purposes, then the maximum number of acres or fraction of an acre required to be dedicated to the city for park facilities incident to and as a condition of approval of such tentative map or parcel map shall be reduced by an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the number of acres or fraction of an acre of such private open space set aside for active recreational purposes, as well as twenty-five percent of the number of acres or fraction of an acre of private open space set aside for passive recreational purposes. 
B.  For purposes of this section, private open space set aside for active recreational purposes shall include any private open space within the subdivision other than yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required by zoning regulations, building regulations and other regulations of the city which meets all of the following requirements: 
1.  The private open space is open to and accessible by all residents of the subdivision; 
2.  The private open space includes one or more of the following active recreational elements: 
a.  Open spaces dedicated to active recreational pursuits such as soccer, golf, baseball, softball and football, 
b.  Tennis courts, badminton courts, shuffleboard courts or similar hard-surfaced areas especially designed and exclusively used for court games, 
c.  Recreational swimming pools or other swimming areas, and 
d.  Buildings and other facilities designed and primarily used for the specific recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision; 
3.  Use of the private open space is restricted for active recreational purposes by a recorded covenant which runs with the land and which can be terminated only with the prior consent of the city council. 
C.  For purposes of this section, private open space set aside for passive recreational purposes shall include any private open space within the subdivision other than yards, court areas, setbacks and other open areas required by zoning regulations, building regulations and other regulations of the city which meets all of the following requirements: 
1.  The private open space is open to and accessible by all residents of the subdivision; 
2.  The private open space includes one or more of the following passive recreational elements: 
a.  Landscaped areas, picnic areas and gardens, 
b.  Areas set aside as natural habitats for the preservation of rare, endangered or otherwise significant natural vegetation, 
c.  Lakes, ponds, creeks, streams and other similar water impoundments and water courses, and

3.  Use of the private open space is restricted for passive recreational purposes by a recorded covenant which runs with the land and which can be terminated only with the prior consent of the city council. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.050 - Application of parkland dedication requirements to subdivisions containing lots and parcels likely to be further subdivided. 
    Where an application is filed for approval of a tentative map or a parcel map for a subdivision which contains less than fifty-one lots or parcels, such subdivisions, nevertheless, shall be deemed to contain fifty-one or more lots or parcels for purposes of land dedication requirements provided for by this chapter where the planning commission, based on all available evidence including but not limited to the kind of development that would be permitted within the subdivision pursuant to the general plan or any applicable specific plan, determines that one or more lots within the subdivision are likely to be further subdivided in a manner which will create a total of fifty-one or more lots or parcels within the entire subdivision. Moreover, where a subdivision contains lots and parcels likely to be further subdivided, the planning commission shall determine the maximum number of acres and/or fraction of an acre to be dedicated to the city for park facilities in the manner hereinbefore provided by this chapter based on the maximum number of dwelling units which would be permitted within the subdivision pursuant to the provisions of the general plan or any relevant specific plan rather than on the zoning regulations applicable to the subdivision. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.060 - Improvements to dedicated parkland and adjoining public rights-of-way. 
    When the planning commission has required the dedication of land for park facilities incident to and as a condition of the approval of a tentative map or parcel map for a subdivision, the planning commission as a further condition of such approval, may require the construction and installation of the following public improvements within the dedicated parkland and adjoining public rights-of-way: 
A.  Storm drainage facilities necessary for the conveyance and disposal of stormwaters generated within or flowing through the dedicated parkland; 
B.  Fencing necessary in order to provide an appropriate barrier between the dedicated parkland and adjoining properties; 
C.  Street improvements within the adjoining public rights-of-way including, but not limited to, street paving, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street trees and traffic control devices; and 
D.  Any other improvements which the planning commission determines are necessary in order to make the dedicated parkland suitable for development as a park facility. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.070 - Use of dedicated parkland. 
    Where parkland has been dedicated to and accepted by the city in accordance with the conditions of approval of a tentative map or parcel map for a subdivision, such parkland shall be used only for the purpose of developing neighborhood or community park and recreational facilities which serve the residents of the subdivision, all in accordance with a parkland development schedule adopted by the city council. Such parkland development schedule shall be adopted by the city council within six months of the acceptance by city of dedicated parkland or on or before the date the council adopts the first annual city budget next following such acceptance, whichever last occurs, and shall specify how and when such parkland will be used for the development of neighborhood or community park facilities which serve the inhabitants of the subdivision for which the parkland dedication was made. When adopting such parkland development schedule the city council shall fully consider any recommendations thereon which are made by the city parks and recreation commission; as well as the special recreation needs, if any, of the inhabitants of the subdivision for which the parkland dedication was made. Following adoption of such parkland development schedule, the city council may, from time to time, amend the schedule in any manner which it deems appropriate. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.080 - Sale or exchange of dedicated parkland. 
    If, following the city's acceptance of parkland dedicated to it in accordance with the conditions of approval of any tentative map or parcel map for a subdivision, the city council determines that there is another site available that would more suitably serve the park and recreational needs of future inhabitants of such subdivision, or that there is another site available that could be developed, operated and maintained in a manner which meets the needs of the future inhabitants of the subdivision for park facilities at a cost significantly less than the cost of developing, operating and maintaining the dedicated land for park and recreational purposes, then the city council may either sell the dedicated land and use the proceeds from such sale to acquire and develop such other site for park and recreational purposes, or may exchange the dedicated land for such other site. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.090 - Payment of fees in lieu of dedication of land. 
    If the planning commission elects to have the developer pay fees in lieu of dedicating land, the amount of the fees to be paid shall be established by applying the formula set forth in Section 15.36.060 of this code, the maximum potential number of residential dwelling units which could be built within the subdivision under the zoning ordinances there in effect. The planning commission may, however, reduce the fees payable by applying the same standards and criteria it would use in determining that the maximum amount of dedicated parkland allowed by ordinance is not necessary to meet the needs arising from a particular subdivision. The foregoing fees shall be paid prior to approval of the parcel map or final map on the subdivision. Any fees paid pursuant to the foregoing requirements shall be used in the manner and subject to the time schedules set forth in this code. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.100 - Credit against park facility fees. 
    Where parkland has been dedicated to and accepted by the city in accordance with the conditions of approval of any tentative map or parcel map for a subdivision, the owner of any residential lot or parcel within such subdivision shall, at the time of applying for a permit authorizing the construction or installation of a building or structure on such lot or parcel, be entitled to a credit against any park capital improvement fee now or hereafter assessed and levied by or pursuant to the provisions of Title 15 of this code at the time of the issuance of such permit in the amount provided for therein. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990) 
16.30.110 - Dedication of additional parkland to mitigate significant environmental effects. 
    Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the planning commission, incident to and as a condition of the approval of a tentative or parcel map for any residential or nonresidential subdivision may require the dedication of park and recreation facilities at any location and in any amount which the planning commission determines is necessary in order to substantially mitigate an adverse environmental effect identified in an environmental assessment or environmental impact report provided in connection with the approval of such tentative or parcel map. 
(Ord. 573 § 1 (part), 1990)

Chapter 17.03 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS 

17.03.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter provides a procedure to request a reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (together, "the Acts") in the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies, and procedures. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 5-20-2014) 
17.03.020 - Review authority. 
    The director, or his or her designee, is designated to approve, conditionally approve, or deny all applications for reasonable accommodations, provided that the director may decide to allow the planning commission to determine whether to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for a reasonable accommodation if the director finds that the reasonable accommodation application involves significant controversy or extraordinary circumstances. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 5-20-2014) 
17.03.030 - Application for reasonable accommodation. 
A.  Eligibility. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability, their representative, or any entity, when the application of a requirement of this zoning code or other city requirement, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities for a disabled person. A person with a disability is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This section is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts. 
B.  Permissible Accommodations. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the substantive and/or procedural rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. 
C.  No Variance. A reasonable accommodation may be granted in compliance with this section without the need for the approval of a variance. 
D.  Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation shall be made on a form provided by the planning department. No fee shall be required for an application for reasonable accommodation. In addition to materials required under other applicable provisions of the Anderson Municipal Code, an application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following: 
1.  Documentation that the applicant is: (i) disabled; (ii) applying on behalf of one or more disabled persons; or (iii) a developer or provider of housing for one or more disabled persons; 
2.  The specific exception or modification to the zoning code provision, policy, or practices requested by the applicant; 
3.  Documentation that the specific exception or modification requested by the applicant is necessary to provide one or more disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the residence; 
4.  Any other information that the director reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether the findings required by Section 17.03.050(A) can be made, so long as any request for information regarding the disabled person benefited complies with the protections provided by the Acts and the privacy rights of the individuals affected. 
E.  Other Discretionary Approvals. If the request for reasonable accommodation is made with another discretionary permit or approval, then the applicant may file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval, and may elect to have the reasonable accommodation request processed and decided simultaneously with the application for the other discretionary permit. In such cases, the procedures applicable to the other discretionary permit shall govern the processing of the reasonable accommodation request. If the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 5-20-2014) 
17.03.040 - Decision. 
A.  Director Decisions. The director shall mail his or her written determination to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation to the applicant within thirty days of the receipt of a complete application a reasonable accommodation. 
B.  Commission and Council Decisions. A written determination on whether to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the body. For decisions associated with other discretionary approvals, the decision shall be issued at the same time and in the same manner as the decisions on the other discretionary approvals are issued. If there are no associated discretionary approvals, the body shall issue a decision on the reasonable accommodation within thirty days of the reasonable accommodation being first placed on the body's agenda for consideration. 
C.  Appeals. Any director decision may be appealed to the planning commission. A planning commission decision may be appealed to the city council. Appeals must be filed within fourteen days of the decision. Decisions by the city council are final and not appealable. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 5-20-2014) 
17.03.050 - Findings. 
A.  Findings. The written decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval or conditional approval of a reasonable accommodation: 
1.  The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or more disabled persons protected under the Acts. 
2.  The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
3.  The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city as "undue financial or administrative burden" is defined in Acts. 
4.  The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program, as "fundamental alteration" is defined in the Acts. 
5.  The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
B.  Alternative Accommodations. In making findings, the decision maker may approve alternative reasonable accommodations which provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant. 
C.  Factors-Equal Opportunity. The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide a disabled person an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or more disabled persons; 
2.  Whether a disabled person will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation; 
3.  In the case of a group home, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants; 
4.  In the case of a group home, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide disabled persons and equal opportunity to live in a residential setting. 
D.  Factors-Fundamental Alteration. The city may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the city's zoning program: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood; 
2.  Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking; 
3.  Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any express purpose of either the city's general plan or an applicable specific plan; 
4.  In the case of a group home, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation. 
E.  Conditions of Approval. In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the approving authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation would comply with the findings. 
F.  Rules While Decision is Pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 
G.  Effective Date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation has become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until a decision is made on such appeal and becomes final. 
(Ord. No. 788, § 1, 5-20-2014) 
17.03.060 - Expiration, time extension, violation, discontinuance and revocation. 
A.  Expiration. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall expire within twenty-four months from the effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless: 
1.  A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced; 
2.  A certificate of occupancy has been issued; 
3.  The use is established; or 
4.  A time extension has been granted. 
B.  Time Extension. The director may approve a time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause for a period or periods not to exceed one year. An application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the director no less than thirty days or more than ninety days prior to the expiration date. 
1.  Notice of the director's decision on a time extension shall be provided in the same manner as the notice provided for in Section 17.03.040(A). All written decisions shall give notice of the right to appeal and to request a reasonable accommodation in the appeals process. 
2.  A time extension for a reasonable accommodation shall be final unless appealed within fourteen calendar days of the date of mailing of the determination. An appeal shall be made in writing and shall be noticed and heard pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter. 
C.  Violation of Terms. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. 
D.  Discontinuance. A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for one hundred eighty consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a residence vacate, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the director determines that: (1) the modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the code, and (2) the accommodation is necessary to give another disabled person an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. The director may request the applicant or his or her successor in interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are disabled persons. Failure to provide such documentation within ten days of the date of a request by the city shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the city of a previously approved reasonable accommodation. 
E.  Modifications to Approved Permits. A reasonable accommodation may be modified. Procedures for modification shall be as prescribed by the development services director or his/ her designee.

Chapter 17.15 - MIXED USE DISTRICT ALLOWED USES AND FORM BASED STANDARDS 

17.15.010 - Purpose, intent, and applicability. 
A.  Chapter Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish unique allowed use and development standards for subject property within the Mixed Use area as defined by the City of Anderson Zoning Code. It is the intent of these standards to help preserve and protect the existing, historic, and unique character of Downtown Anderson by requiring new construction and remodels and existing construction to enhance the existing built environment and provide additional development opportunities. Additionally, the application of these standards will enable the Downtown area to become a pedestrian-oriented shopping, doing, entertainment, and living center for the city and environs. 
B.  Applicability of Standards and Entitlement Review. The standards of this chapter apply to all property zoned Mixed Use. Uses that require a use permit as listed in Section 17.050 (Allowed use regulations) shall obtain a use permit. 
The Downtown is also governed by a regulating plan that addresses how development interacts with the street and how the street is developed. The application of both the zoning district and the regulating plan (see Section 17.030 (Mixed Use District Definitions) for definition) are described in more detail in Sections 17.020.A (Defining the Mixed Use District) and 17.040 (Regulating Plan and Street Typologies and Standards). Generally, the zoning district designation (Mixed Use) defines the character and allowed use provisions for the subject site while the Regulating Plan defines the development standards (setbacks, building typology, street standards). 
C.  Applicability of Regulating Plan Standards. Generally, the development standards applicable to a property shall be those for the respective zone and street frontage as reflected in the regulating plan. However, for those properties that face onto multiple street frontages (e.g., a corner lot or a double frontage lot), the following shall apply: 
1.  The development standards applicable to the site shall be reflective of the individual sides of the lot. 
For instance, if a corner lot faces Street A and Street B, then that side of the lot facing Street A shall be developed consistent with the standards for Street A and the side facing Street B shall be developed consistent with the standards for Street B. 
2.  At the corner, the design shall merge and unify the two standards together such that: 
a.  The more restrictive setback requirement shall prevail on that side of the corner. 
For instance, if Street A has a five-foot build-to line and Street B has a zero-foot build-to line, then that side facing Street A shall be located at the five-foot build-to line and the side facing Street B shall be located at the zero-foot build-to line. (Note: In this example, the building is not centered on the corner; this is consistent with the intent of this provision.) 
b.  The more restrictive design standards shall prevail on that side of the corner, provided the two standards are architecturally integrated together. 
For instance, if Street A allows for a Stoop frontage and Street B does not, a Stoop may be developed along the Street A frontage, but at the corner the design of the building must architecturally transition into a frontage type that is allowed along Street B. The same shall be true for allowed building types, storefront regulations, sign types, and landscaping. Only those features allowed on that frontage may be developed on said frontage. 
2.  In the case of allowed uses, the least restrictive use provisions shall apply to the entire lot, provided that the primary entrance for the use either faces the street with the least restrictive use regulations or (preferred) faces the intersection/street corner. 
For instance, if a corner lot faces Street A and Street B and Street A allows a particular use by right and Street B requires a conditional use permit for the same use, then the use shall be allowed by right on that lot provided the primary entrance to the use is located facing Street A or (preferred) facing the intersection/at the corner. 
(Ord. 757, § 2(Exh. A), 2009) 
17.15.020 - Introduction to the Mixed Use District. 
A.  Defining the Mixed Use District. The Mixed Use District is the regulating document for development within Downtown Anderson. The basis for this Code is in two unique zoning districts: the Mixed Use-Commercial Emphasis (MU-C) and the Mixed Use-Residential Emphasis (MU-R). The Mixed Use District recognizes the historic character of the Downtown and identifies a special set of development standards, allowed use regulations, and other special use regulations that apply to new construction and qualifying remodels/expansions. 
The standards in this Chapter are presented in a format that is unique to the Downtown-through a form based code. Form based zoning provides a method of regulating development to achieve a desired urban form. Form based provisions address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings, and the size, character, and type of streets and blocks. The central focus of form based provisions is the regulating plan that designates the appropriate form (and character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types, which is the basis of conventional zoning. 
This Mixed Use District also includes regulations for the street-the space between buildings. Part of the historical context of the Downtown includes how individual developments relate and interact with the street. This is because the street acts as a unifying thread across all development. 
B.  Relationship to Other Zoning Provisions. Generally, the regulations of this chapter shall govern development within the Downtown. In cases where there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and the regulations elsewhere in the Zoning Code, this Chapter shall prevail. However, with regard to topics on which this Chapter is silent, provisions elsewhere in the Zoning Code shall prevail. 
(Ord. 757, § 2(Exh. A), 2009) 
17.15.030 - Mixed Use District definitions. 
    The following terms are used throughout the Mixed Use District and are defined as follows: 
    Alley. A narrow public drive serving commercial and residential development. (See Section 17.040.B.1.e. for further discussion.) 
    Alley parking. Residential or commercial parking that takes access from an alley. (See Section 17.060.I.1. for further discussion.) 
    Arcade frontage. An Arcade frontage is nearly identical in character to the Gallery frontage except that the upper stories of the building may project over the public sidewalk and encroach into the public right-of-way. The sidewalk must be fully absorbed within the colonnade so that a pedestrian may not bypass it. (See Section 17.060.D. for further discussion.) 
    Avenue. Connects districts or regions and capable of carrying a large amount of vehicular traffic while still maintaining a quality pedestrian environment and retail-supporting urban edge. This street typology may be used in place of an Arterial. (See Section 17.040.B.1.a. for further discussion.) 
    Awning. A temporary shelter that is supported from the exterior wall of a building. It is typically constructed of canvas or a similar fabric that is sturdy and flexible. 
    Building type. Defines the type of structure based on massing, layout, and use. (See Section 17.060.E for further discussion.) 
    Build-to line. An urban setback dimension that delineates the maximum distance from the property line a front or street side building facade can be placed. Typically, build-to lines range from zero to ten feet. 
    Bulkhead. The portion of a commercial facade located between the ground and the bottom of the street level display windows. It is typically constructed of stone, brick, or concrete. 
    Bulkhead height. The height of the bulkhead (see "Bulkhead"). (See Section 17.060.G. for further discussion.) 
    Courtyard housing building type. A group of dwelling units arranged to share one or more common courtyards on a qualifying lot in any zone. Dwellings take access from the street or the courtyard(s). Dwelling configuration occurs as townhouses, apartments, or apartments located over or under townhouses. The Courtyard is intended to be a semi-public space that is an extension of the public realm. (See Section 17.060.E. for further discussion.) 
    Door Yard/Terrace frontage. Characterized by a facade that is set back from the street property line and multiple levels of the building directly accessible from the street. Door Yard/Terrace is a variation on the Stoop frontage, but it provides opportunities for multiple levels of commercial/retail easily accessible from the street. (See Section 17.060.D. for further discussion.) 
    Dwelling unit. Any room or group of connected rooms that have sleeping, cooking, eating, and bathroom facilities and are intended for long-term occupation. 
    Expression line. An architectural embellishment that delineates the end of the ground floor and the start of the second floor of a building. 
    Facade. The architecturally finished side of a building, typically facing onto a public right-of-way or street. 
    Form based code (FBC). A development code emphasizing the regulation of building form, scale, and orientation, rather than zoning and land use.

17.15.040 - Regulating plan and street typologies and standards. 
A.  Establishment of the Regulating Plan and Street Hierarchy and Character. In addition to the application of the Mixed Use District, development within the Downtown is also governed by the regulating plan. The regulating plan "codes" development based upon the street it is located along. This plan is based on the following street hierarchy and character, and as illustrated on the regulating plan (see Figure 17-1, The Regulating Plan): 
1.  Main street (East Center Street, East Street, and Ventura Street)-A main street is a primary street of Downtown Anderson and provides a social setting for the community. It is pedestrian-oriented and focused on rehabilitation of existing buildings, as well as the development of new infill structures that are compatible with the uniquely small town character of the district. This area benefits from the presence of specialty retail businesses, restaurants, nightlife, and tourism-oriented services. Residential uses that are designed to add activity to the street scene are encouraged. 
2.  Service streets (Freeman Street and West Center Street)-The focus of service streets is to maximum [maximize] on-street parking and provide vehicular access to the backs of buildings and parking lots or to serve the automotive type uses found along West Center Street. 
3.  Neighborhood streets (South Street, Howard Street, Ferry Street, Martha Street, and Oak Street)-The neighborhood streets of Downtown Anderson display a mix of local retail and residential development. They have a more intimate nature than the other areas, as reflected in the narrower sidewalks and streets, and the abundance of street trees and landscaping. Neighborhood streets also provide the primary pedestrian routes between the residential and commercial portions of Downtown. 
4.  Avenues (North Street and Balls Ferry Road)-Avenues are more automobile-oriented than the other streets and replace arterial roadways as these significant roadways pass through Downtown. As such, avenues are an ideal location for regional commercial and family entertainment. 

B.  Street Typologies and Standards. The purpose of this Section is to provide roadway standards that will facilitate the creation of streets that are inviting, multimodal public places for vehicular traffic, bicyclists, and pedestrians. 
1.  Street Typologies. 
a.  Avenue. Avenues connect districts or regions and are capable of carrying a large amount of vehicular traffic while still maintaining a higher quality pedestrian environment and retail-supporting urban edge. This street typology replaces an Arterial in Downtown. 
The landscaping strip along the sides of the roadway should be designed to facilitate the safe passage of pedestrians. It is suggested that the strip include a continuous landscaped area between the edge of the curb and the sidewalk. This area should include street trees and lighting designed at a pedestrian scale. Landscape strips should be a minimum of five feet wide. Where a continuous landscape strip is not possible, street trees should be provided within tree wells or at intersections within curb "bulb-outs." 
Wherever an avenue intersects with a main street or a neighborhood street, the intersection should be designed to enhance pedestrian safety and convenience. Features may include pedestrian bulb-outs, differentiated accent paving within the intersection, in-street crossing lights (if there is no crosswalk signal), and pedestrian refuge areas within the medians of avenues. 
b.  Main Street[s]. Street trees should frequently interrupt the parking lanes to soften visual impact of the parked vehicles and to help cool the air heated by the pavement. 
Diagonal parking and wide sidewalks should create a safe, inviting environment for both pedestrians and motorists. 
Wherever a main street intersects with an avenue or a neighborhood street, the intersection should be designed to provide pedestrians with safe passage. Features may include pedestrian bulb-outs, differentiated accent paving within the intersection, and in-street crossing lights (if there is no crosswalk signal). 
Turning movements typically occur from within the main travel lanes: however, short (one- to two-car length) turn pockets may be provided at some intersections in lieu of parking on one side of the street. 
c.  Neighborhood Streets. Neighborhood streets are home to the majority of residential development in Downtown Anderson as well as a few small neighborhood-serving retail stores. These streets have a more intimate nature than the other areas, and because of this landscaping and larger street trees should frequently interrupt the parking lanes to soften visual impact of the parked vehicles and to help cool the air heated by the pavement. A continuous landscape strip is not required. 
d.  Service Streets. The focus of service streets is to maximize on-street parking and provide vehicular access to the backs of buildings and parking lots or to serve the automotive type uses. 
Customer entrances may be located off alleys, but the primary entrance should face a main street, neighborhood street, or avenue if a lot has two frontages. 
e.  Alley. Alleys are narrow public drives serving commercial and residential development. In commercial developments, alleys provide the primary service access and loading areas for businesses. 
Customer entrances may also be located off of alleys. In addition, if it does not obstruct the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, portions of the alley may be used for outdoor retail space, patios, art gardens, and related uses. In residential development, parking should be accessed via alleys. 
Alley street lighting and landscaping should be designed at a pedestrian scale with an emphasis on creating a safe and secure environment. Additionally, landscaping shall not impede automobile or pedestrian visibility within or immediately adjacent to an alley. 
f.  Paseo. Paseos are local and private pathways serving pedestrians and bicyclists only, and they may also provide limited service access during specified periods of the day. In addition, if it does not obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic, portions of the paseo may also be used for outdoor dining, retail space, patios, art gardens, and related uses. 
These types of "streets" are not necessarily shown on the Regulating Plan but would be appropriate to include in the district as part of a unified development plan to connect uses and activities in a pedestrian orientation without additional public right-of-ways. 
Paseo street lighting and landscaping should be designed at a pedestrian scale. Larger canopy trees should be used where possible for shade. 
2.  Street Typology Standards. The following table (Table 17-1) displays associated standards for each street typology.

2.  Street trees shall be provided along neighborhood streets. Bulb-outs at street intersections and landscape planters placed between parallel parking spaces shall be provided of sufficient size to accommodate street trees planted at regular intervals as required by the Planning Director. 
(Ord. 757, § 2(Exh. A), 2009) 
17.15.050 - Allowed use regulations. 
    The purpose of this section is to list allowed uses according to districts and Downtown zones within the districts. This list is not meant to be exhaustive and does not regulate building character or design, but instead delineates the types of uses allowed within a building. These allowed use regulations are unique to Chapter 17 and are intended to implement the vision of the Anderson General Plan. 
    Areas within the Downtown area that are zoned C-1 are subject to the applicable regulations in the Zoning Code related to that zoning district. Buildings constructed within Downtown are encouraged to comply with building placement and design standards set forth for the Mixed Use District. 
A.  Permitted Uses. The following table (Table 17-2) identifies the permitted uses within the Downtown. These allowed use regulations are listed by street type, then by District, as applicable. The uses listed are defined in Section 17.050.B (Definitions of Permitted Uses).

Examples include, but are not limited to, accountants and financial advisors, architects, artists, attorneys, and real estate sales. 
6.  Live/Work Unit. An integrated housing unit and working space, occupied and utilized by a single household in a structure, either single-family or multi-family, that has been designed or structurally modified to accommodate joint residential occupancy and work activity, and which includes: 
a.  Complete kitchen space and sanitary facilities in compliance with the City building code; and 
b.  Working space reserved for and regularly used by one or more occupants of the unit. 
c.  The difference between live/work and work/live units is that the "work" component of a live/work unit is secondary to its residential use and may include only commercial activities and pursuits that are compatible with the character of a quiet residential environment, while the work component of a work/live unit is the primary use to which the residential component is secondary. 
7.  Mixed-Use. Characterized by commercial retail use on the ground floor and office, hotel, or residential uses on the upper floors. 
8.  Multi-Family Residential. A building designed and intended for occupancy by two or more families living independent of each other, each in a separate dwelling unit, which may be owned individually or by a single landlord (e.g., duplex, triplex, quadplex, apartment, apartment house, condominium).

Neighborhood markets are less than eight thousand square feet in size and operate less than eighteen hours a day. Neighborhood markets may include deli or beverage tasting facilities that are ancillary to the market/grocery portion of the use. Alcohol sales are allowed for off-site consumption or on-site consumption as part of the beverage tasting facility only. 
10.  Offices. This use includes businesses providing direct services to consumers (e.g., insurance companies, utility companies), professional offices (e.g., accounting, attorneys, doctors, dentists, employment, public relations), personal services (e.g., barber and beauty shops, shoe repair, tailors), and offices engaged in the production of intellectual property (e.g., advertising, architectural, computer programming, photography studios).

(Ord. 757, § 2(Exh. A), 2009; Ord. No. 767, 9-21-2010) 
17.15.060 - Development standards. 
    Development standards for development activities are intended to encourage, protect, and preserve the historic urban image of Downtown Anderson. They are also intended to improve overall aesthetic appearance and to serve as an incentive for private investment. 
    An important initiative of the Anderson Mixed Use District is to clearly spell out development standards that shape the desired urban form. Building intensities are regulated through conformance to the prescribed development standards and design guidelines (e.g., height, setbacks, parking, form, massing). 
A.  General Development Standards. 
1.  Mandatory Conformance. Standards listed in this Section-General Development Standards-as well as architectural and design standards listed in Section 17.070, are mandatory requirements that must be satisfied for all new projects and modifications to existing development, as follows: 
a.  Projects shall be reviewed for conformance with these provisions as part of design review. 
b.  Modifications to existing development, except for minor modifications listed (as listed in [Subsection] c., below) and that only require issuance of a building permit, shall be reviewed for conformance to the standards within this chapter as part of plan check during building permit review. 
c.  Standards within this Chapter are not applicable to minor modifications to a structure, such as repair, restoration, or reconstruction, where such work, as determined by the Planning Director, maintains the outer dimensions and surface relationships of the existing structure (e.g., repainting, replacement of windows or doors with matching size and style, repair of exterior materials such as stucco, brick, and wood) 
2.  Adaptive Reuse Provisions. The following exemptions to the design standards are provided to allow the reuse of existing small scale buildings within the district: 
a.  Within the MU-C portion of the district the following exemptions and provisions shall apply to nonconforming houses or stand-alone structures on lots seven thousand square feet or smaller: 
i.  Structures are exempted from the "build-to" requirements. 
ii.  Maintenance, repair and modifications are permitted without compliance to provisions within this Chapter provided such work does not exceed fifty percent of the appraised value thereof, according to the assessor's records or current appraisal of valuation of subject property. Any appraisal shall be furnished and paid for by the applicant. 
iii.  The design review committee shall review remodels, and expansions, unless otherwise exempted. A determination shall be made by the committee that the improvements comply with the spirit of the design standards by incorporating one or more features. 
b.  Within the MU-R, conversions from residential to an allowed commercial use (e.g. offices, restaurants and small shops) is subject to review and approval by the design review committee. The DRC shall review the conversion plans to ensure the character of the building is preserved while allowing for necessary commercial modifications including but not limited to Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. 
c.  Nonconforming properties located in either the MU-C or MU-R that qualify as historic buildings or resources as defined by this code may also expand or remodel subject to review and approval by the design review committee that the historic character of the building is maintained or reestablished. 
3.  Area-Wide Height Requirements and Exceptions. Refer to Section 17.060.B. and Table 17-3 for district height requirements. 
The approval body may approve architectural features such as tower elements, elevator service shafts, and roof access stairwells that extend above the height limit. Telecommunications antennas and service structures located on rooftops may also exceed the maximum building height but shall be hidden to the maximum extent possible using appropriate screening and "stealth" technologies. 
B.  Height Requirements. The maximum height is specified in Table 17-3 below and is intended to preserve the compact, walkable, historic Downtown core while simultaneously stimulating economic development in the commercial heart of the City. 
TABLE 17-3: HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS 
Main Street Service Street Neighborhood Street Avenue Maximum Height 1 45' 45' 35' 45'  
1.  The maximum height may be increased by twenty percent with a use permit. 
C.  Building Placement. The setbacks and build-to lines for Downtown Anderson are intended to enhance social interactions in the historic Downtown retail core while simultaneously providing appropriate levels of privacy in residential areas. 
Table 17-4 and Figure 17-10 display setback requirements for each Downtown Anderson district. 
TABLE 17-4: SETBACK AND "BUILD-TO" REQUIREMENTS

* Build-to lines are defined as the edge where the public right-of-way ends and the private property boundary begins. The line may vary from the standards specified in this table if a conflict exists with the allowed frontage type. Additional setback may be permitted to allow for outdoor seating, an entry plaza and other similar areas. Buildings may not be setback to accommodate parking in front of building facades. 
D.  Frontage Types. The architectural composition of the front facade of a building, particularly concerning how it relates and ties into the surrounding public realm. The Downtown Anderson frontage types are intended to enhance social interactions in the historic Downtown retail core while simultaneously providing appropriate levels of privacy in residential areas. Allowed frontage types in the different districts and along the four street types are listed in Table 17-5 and defined below. An "X" means that the frontage type is allowed; a blank cell means that the frontage type is not allowed.

1.  Half Block Liner. An attached building with a frontage of approximately one-third to one-half the length of a downtown block and zero side yard setbacks. It is used for mixed-use, residential, and commercial development. 

2.  Infill. An attached building with frontage that is less than one-third the length of a downtown block and zero side yard setbacks. It is used for mixed-use, residential, and commercial development. 

3.  Terraced. A mixed-use, residential, or commercial building characterized by individual units that are assessed via multileveled outdoor terraces. The terraces are intended to be semi-public spaces that are extensions of the public realm. 
4.  Front Yard Housing. A detached building designed as a single-family residence, duplex, triplex, or quadplex. Front Yard Housing is accessed from the sidewalk adjacent to the street build-to line. 

5.  Rowhouse. Two or more detached two- or three-story dwellings with zero side yard setbacks. A rowhouse may be used for nonresidential purposes. 

6.  Courtyard Housing. A group of dwelling units arranged to share one or more common courtyards on a qualifying lot in any zone. Dwellings take access from the street or the courtyard(s). Dwelling configuration occurs as town houses, apartments, or apartments located over or under town houses. The courtyard is intended to be a semi-public space that is an extension of the public realm. 

F.  Residential Standards When Part of Mixed-Use Development. The residential component of a mixed-use development may be located wholly within an existing commercial building or in an entirely new structure. The following requirements apply: 
1.  To provide adequate privacy and security, residential entrances may be grade-separated or placed in the quieter areas away from the main commercial portions. 
2.  Access to residential use shall be clearly delineated. 
3.  Access to open space areas, either public or private, shall be provided when available. 
4.  When in a mixed configuration, residential uses should be located on the upper stories or on ground floors when they do not use storefront space. Residential uses may occupy, on a temporary basis, the ground floor of a building located on commercial street frontage, but the ground floor shall be designed to accommodate future commercial use. 
5.  Units of various sizes (e.g., studios, one- and two-bedroom units) are encouraged. 
6.  Open space shall be required regardless if the residential use is located in an existing, expanded, or new structure: 
a.  The amount of open space shall be governed by the standards of the residential zoning most similar in nature and function to the proposed residential portion of the mixed-use development. However, the amount may be reduced based on the anticipated needs of the future tenants and the quality, usefulness, and/or amenities within the spaces provided. 
b.  On-site open space may include, but is not limited to, pedestrian walkways, plaza areas, landscape areas, roof gardens, terraces, and other creative spaces which may be used either visually, actively, or passively by the residents within the development. 
c.  Public open space such as parks, plazas, public recreational facilities, and other similar facilities located within one-quarter mile may be counted toward the open space requirement for the mixed-use development. 
G.  Storefront Regulations. The following storefront standards are intended to provide continuity of building form at street level in Downtown Anderson. Additionally, standards are meant to enhance the relationship between buildings and the sidewalk, subsequently encouraging more pedestrian activity. 
Table 17-7 lists the storefront design standards. "Tags" refer to those elements labeled in Figure 17-11 and described below (Storefront Design Standard Definitions).

H.  Storefront Design Standard Definitions. 
1.  Storefront Width. The front facade width as measured from one corner of the front facade to the other. 
2.  Ground Floor Height. The height of the front facade's first story as measured from the sidewalk level to the top of the expression line. An expression line is an architectural embellishment that delineates the end of the ground floor and the start of the second floor of a building. 
3.  Bulkhead Height. The height of the bulkhead which is the portion of a commercial facade located between the ground and the bottom of the street level display windows. It is typically constructed of stone, brick, or concrete. 
4.  Inset of Front Door from Build-To Line. The distance from the front door of the building to the build-to line. A build-to line is an urban setback dimension that delineates the maximum distance from the property line a front building facade can be placed. Typically, build-to lines range from zero to ten feet. See Table 17-7 for build-to line regulations in Downtown Anderson. 
5.  Maximum Awning Extension from Building. The maximum distance allowed between the building and the end of a fully extended awning. An awning is a temporary shelter that is supported from the exterior wall of a building. It is typically constructed of canvas or a similar fabric that is sturdy and flexible. 

6.  Entry Plazas and Seating Areas. Downtown stores are encouraged to integrate outdoor seating and entry plazas into the design of buildings. The building facades may be setback from the build-to line to accommodate outdoor seating and/or plazas. Storefront windows and doors shall be used to ensure that a visual connection is maintained between the outdoor and indoor areas of the use. 

I.  Parking. Parking requirements have been reduced to encourage pedestrian activity and economic growth in Downtown Anderson. In the design of parking facilities, consideration should be given to locating parking in the back or at the sides of buildings in order to maintain a continuous retail facade for pedestrians along downtown streets. 
1.  Allowable Parking Types. Allowable parking types listed in Table 17-8 and defined below. An "A" means that the parking type is allowed; a "P" means that the parking type is preferred and highly encouraged. An "N" means that the parking type is not allowed.

2.  Parking Standards. 
a.  Downtown Anderson encourages "one-stop" parking where shoppers park once and visit multiple stores on foot. On-street parking is encouraged and along certain streets may serve as the only parking for a use. Shared parking lots are encouraged. 
b.  Locating parking lots between the front property line and the building store front is prohibited. Instead, off-street parking should be located to the rear of buildings. Street parking should be available whenever possible in front of retail stores. 
c.  When off-street parking in the rear is not possible, the visual impact of headlight bleed and the asphalt parking surface shall be minimized by landscaped berms and/or walls with a maximum height of 3 feet. 
d.  Rear parking lots should be designed and located contiguously, or adjacent to alleys, so that vehicles can travel from one private parking lot to the other either directly or via an alley without having to enter a street. This may be achieved with reciprocal shared access agreements. 
e.  Locate rear parking lots or structure entries on side streets or alleys in order to minimize pedestrian/vehicular conflicts. 
f.  Create wide, well-lit, landscaped pedestrian walkways connecting on-site pedestrian circulation systems in parking lots to off-site public sidewalks and building entries. 
g.  In order to minimize conflicting vehicle turning movement along major roadways, the City encourages shared access drives within and between integrated nonresidential development. This reduces the number of driveway curb cuts. The City also encourages reciprocal access between non-residential developments to provide for convenience, safety, and efficient circulation. If incorporated, a reciprocal access agreement shall be recorded with the land by the owners of abutting properties to ensure shared access will be preserved over time. 
h.  The layout of parking areas should be designed so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars. 
i.  Parking areas that accommodate a significant number of vehicles should be divided into a series of connected smaller lots. Landscaping and offsetting portions of the lot are effective in reducing the visual impact of larger parking areas. 
j.  Demarcation of parking spaces should be legible, and the spaces should be adequate but not overly generous. 
k.  Parking structures (privately owned and operated) are encouraged to incorporate retail and/or office space on the street level of the structure. This prevents the structure from becoming a pedestrian "dead zone" in Downtown Anderson. 
J.  Signs. The following sign standards are intended to encourage creative sign design as an integral part of a building's architecture, rather than treating signs as an add-on or afterthought. Additionally, stimulating retail and wayfinding signage in Downtown Anderson will increase economic activity and city legibility. While this Section addresses permanent signage within the Downtown, additional provisions for temporary signs, prohibited signs, and other general provisions may be found in Chapter 17.44 (Comprehensive Sign Ordinance). 
1.  Relation to Other City Sign Regulations. Where conflicts exist between this Section and Chapter 17.44 (Comprehensive Sign Ordinance), provisions within this Section shall prevail. 
2.  Allowed Sign Types. Allowed types of signs are listed in Table 17-9 by street type and zone. An "A" means that the sign type is allowed; a "P" means that the sign type is preferred and highly encouraged. An "N" means that the sign type is not allowed.

N-Not permitted 
A-Allowed 
P-Preferred and highly encouraged. 

3.  Sign Size and Number. Consistent with the standards of Chapter 17.44 (Comprehensive Sign Ordinance), the maximum allowed number and size for signs in downtown shall be as follows: 
a.  Freestanding Sign. One freestanding identification sign per site allowing one-quarter foot of sign area per foot of lot frontage on which the sign is to be located, not to exceed twenty square feet in area nor six feet in height on a site where all buildings are set back at least ten feet from the street curb or street pavement edge on which the use fronts. Where the subject property exceeds one acre in size, the maximum sign area may be increased to forty square feet and height to ten feet. 
b.  Wall Sign. One wall sign per building frontage. Maximum wall sign area is determined as follows, not to exceed one hundred square feet: 
i.  For buildings with only one building frontage: One-half square foot of sign area for each ground-level linear foot of building frontage. 
ii.  For buildings with multiple building frontages: One-half square foot of sign area for each ground-level linear foot of one building frontage and one-quarter square foot of sign area for each linear foot of additional frontage. The basic sign area in a multitenant center may be reallocated between businesses by the center manager based on an overall sign plan for the center. 
c.  Marquee Sign. One marquee sign per building occupant which does not exceed five square feet in area or is located lower than seven and one-half [feet] above the grade level below it. No sign may be placed upon the roof of a marquee. 
d.  Projecting Signs. One projecting sign per building, not to exceed four-tenths square feet for every linear foot of main entrance facade frontage, not to exceed a maximum of twenty square feet. A projecting sign shall be at least eight feet above grade directly below the sign. 
e.  Multistory Building Directory Sign. One directory wall sign for each primary building entry to identify occupants in a multistory building. The sign may not exceed five square feet in area. 
f.  A-Frame Signs. One freestanding A-frame sign not exceeding an area of four square feet and three feet in height per establishment. 
3.  Sign Design. Design, color, materials, size, and placement are all important in creating signs that are architecturally attractive and integrated into the overall site design. Signs that are compatible with the surroundings and effectively communicate a message will promote a quality visual environment. The standards that follow address these issues and others; the standards are intended to help business owners provide quality signs that add to and support the character of Downtown Anderson. 
a.  General Design Standards. 
i.  Design signs in harmony with the style and character of the development and as an integral design component of the building architecture, building materials, landscaping, and overall site development. 
ii.  Sign letters and materials should be professionally designed and fabricated. 
iii.  Exposed conduit and tubing (raceway) is prohibited. All transformers and other equipment shall be concealed. 
iv.  All signs shall be maintained in good repair, including the display surface, which shall be kept neatly painted or posted. 
v.  The exposed back of all signs visible to the public shall be suitably finished and maintained. 
vi.  The use of retractable awnings as a signage tool is acceptable. 
b.  Placement. 
i.  Signs should be generally free of obstructions when viewed from different angles. However, trees or other landscaping that grow to a point that it obstructs the view of a sign or makes it illegible shall not be grounds for removal or trimming of the plant(s). 
ii.  Utilize a consistent proportion of signage to building scale, such as one-third text to two-thirds wall area or one-fourth text to three-fourths wall area. See Figure 17-15 (Text Scale). 

c.  Materials. 
i.  Paper and cloth signs are appropriate for interior temporary use only and are not permitted on the exterior of a building. 
ii.  The use of neon is permitted if it fits with the style of the architecture (e.g., art deco) and is not a nuisance (e.g., produces glare) to the surrounding properties. 

Sign Tips: Colors and Materials 
-Use exterior materials, finishes, and colors in harmony with, or an upgrade to, those of the buildings or structures on site. 
-The selected materials need to contribute to the legibility of the sign. For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections. 
-Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. 
-Limit the total number of colors used in any one sign. Small accents of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive, but the competition between large areas of many different colors decreases readability. 
d.  Sign Legibility. 
i.  Avoid spacing letters and words too close together. Crowding of letters, words, or lines will make any sign more difficult to read. Conversely, over-spacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually, again obscuring the message. As a general rule, letters should not occupy more than 75 percent of the sign panel area. 

Sign Tips: Legibility 
-Use a brief message whenever possible. Fewer words help produce a more effective sign. A sign with a brief, succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive. 
-Limit the number of lettering styles in order to increase legibility. A general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for large signs. 
-Use symbols and logos in the place of words whenever appropriate. Pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewer's mind than a written message. 
-Avoid hard-to-read, overly intricate typefaces and symbols. Typefaces and symbols that are hard to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
e.  Sign Illumination. 

i.  The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will create glare or other negative impact on residential properties in direct line of sight to the sign. 
ii.  Whenever indirect lighting fixtures are used (fluorescent or incandescent), care shall be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-of-way. 
iii.  Reserved. 
iv.  Reserved. 
v.  Internally illuminated plastic box "canned" signs are prohibited. Individually illuminated channel letters are acceptable. 
vi.  Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or other illumination devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness, or color. 
vii.  Light sources shall utilize energy-efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible and shall comply with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (California Building Standards Code). 

Sign Tips: Illumination 
-If the sign can be illuminated by an indirect source of light, this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures attached to the front of the structure cast light on the sign and the face of the structure as well. 
-Individually illuminated letters should be backfill. Signs composed of individual letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure. 
K.  Landscaping. Landscaping in Downtown Anderson should be pedestrian-oriented and reflect and enhance the area's small town charm. These provisions emphasize the use of potted plants, trees, and landscaping along urban streetscapes and within urban parking lots. Landscaping shall be provided on-site consistent with the standards set forth below. 
1.  Landscaping Standards. 
a.  Street Trees. Street trees shall be provided every thirty feet on center within the required landscape area. Tree selection shall be from the city's adopted street tree list and to the satisfaction of the planning director. 

b.  Standard Design Concepts. 
i.  Use landscaping to complement the architecture, to minimize the impact of incompatible land uses, and to establish a transition between adjacent developments. Plant materials can absorb sound, filter air, curtail erosion, provide shade, and maintain privacy. 
ii.  Provide landscaping to break up blank walls, shade pedestrians, accent entries, and soften the connection of paving for vehicles to buildings. 
iii.  Landscaping strips (or bulb-outs) on public streets should be wide enough for canopy shade that is consistent with the street width. See standards for landscape area width in Section 17.040. 
iv.  The use of alternative types of landscaping strip ground cover is strongly encouraged. Standard grass strip is discouraged. 
v.  Parking facilities shall attain a minimum of fifty percent tree canopy coverage within ten years of completion of construction to provide shade and minimize visual and environmental impacts. 
vi.  In surface parking lots, trees should be installed at a ratio of one tree per three parking stalls for the perimeter of the parking lot and one tree per six spaces for the interior of the parking lot. 
vii.  Consider placement of trees and shrubs to avoid conflict with vehicular overhangs, traffic and visibility patterns, and on-site structures. 
viii.  Owners of vacant lots without any structures shall seed the lot(s) on a regular basis and mow a minimum of once a season to eliminate fire danger or as necessary to present a clean and tidy appearance. 
ix.  Owners of vacant lots that contain structures shall maintain the existing landscaping on a regular basis so that the lot(s) should not give an overgrown appearance. 
x.  Landscape should be oriented in accord with the demands of the species for sunlight and its susceptibility to the prevailing wind. 
c.  Irrigation. Irrigation of landscaping shall only be directed onto the landscaping. Spillover onto hardscape shall be minimized to the maximum extent feasible. 
d.  Tree Grates/Guards. 
i.  Tree grates should be utilized at passages to provide a continuous walking surface while providing adequate space for the tree to grow. 
ii.  Install structural soil systems to direct new root growth downward below hardscape areas, which helps to postpone root damage caused to the surrounding hardscape and structures. By providing deep watering and air to root systems as appropriate when trees are planted within five feet of any permanent structure/paving/curb, additional service life may be achieved. Structural soil systems are preferred over root barriers as they are often more effective. 
iii.  A minimum of six feet of structural soil shall be provided for trees. The area of enhanced root zone environment shall be enlarged beyond this minimum according to the species size planted. The structural soil can be provided under tree grates and pavement. 
iv.  Trees and landscaping installed in parking lots should be protected from vehicle damage by a minimum six-inch-tall concrete curb surrounding the planter area. Planter barriers to protect landscaping should also be designed with intermittent curb cuts to allow parking lot runoff to drain into landscape areas. 

e.  Pots and Planters. 
i.  Boxed and container plants in decorative planters of ceramic, terra cotta, wood, metal, or stucco should be used to enhance public areas. 
ii.  Large planters may also be incorporated into seating areas. Such planters should be open to the earth below and be provided with a permanent irrigation system. 
iii.  Hanging flower baskets enhance the beauty of the Downtown. Lamp posts should include supports and irrigation systems for hanging flower baskets. Flower baskets may also hang from buildings, such as on arcades, galleries, porches, and other frontage types, provided that supports are architecturally consistent with the building and irrigation systems are included. 

f.  Water Quality and Urban Runoff. Because of the proximity of the downtown to natural riparian areas and the potential impact of urban activities on the natural environment, water quality and urban runoff in the downtown is of particular concern. The use of bioswales and landscaped water quality basins represents the preferred approach to urban runoff and stormwater quality control throughout downtown, particularly in the MU-R zone. Such features add aesthetic character, utilize natural materials, and serve as a functional element that allows for stormwater management. 
i.  Bioswales and similar natural landscaped runoff control facilities shall be used to enhance appearance of stormwater management methods and allow for groundwater recharge. 
ii.  Bioswales shall be used to collect surface runoff before it crosses pavement areas and to reduce ponding and damage to walkways. Bioswales shall be graded to direct water away from paved areas into detention basins. 
iii.  Bioswales shall utilize a slope that is steep enough to prevent ponding and shallow enough to slow water velocity. Soils must not readily drain water; the goal is to get cleaner water to flow downstream. Recommended slopes of one to four percent should be used. Flow should be sufficiently low enough to provide adequate residence time within the channel. Flow depth should not be taller than the vegetation (a maximum depth of four inches is recommended). Final design of bioswales shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer. 
(Ord. 757, § 2(Exh. A), 2009) 
17.15.070 - Special use regulations and other standards.

F.  Unit Size and Setbacks. A residential planned development may not be established on parcels of land comprised of not less than three acres of contiguous land, unless the planning commission, in its discretion, or the city council upon appeal, finds that the property of less than three acres is suitable, by virtue of its unique character. When a P-D district abuts a residential zone, the setback requirements of the adjacent residential zone shall apply to that portion of the P-D district along the common boundary. 
G.  Residential Densities. The residential density allowed in a P-D district shall be limited by the regulations applicable to each particular zone combined with the P-D district, except as to more restrictive regulations which may be prescribed by the planning commission at the time of approval of the proposed development plan in calculating the density of a proposed P-D district. The gross area, including street dedications, shall be included and computed according to the following formula: 
    Maximum Density: 
    PD R-1 = 4.6 units per acre 
    PD R-2 = 12 units per acre 
    PD R-3 = 20 units per acre

17.33.060 Village Center mixed use. 
A.  Purpose. The mixed-use designation is applied to the Village Center of the Vineyards SP which is intended to serve as a vibrant self-contained community core as well as the active focal point for surrounding residential areas. The mixed-use community core area provides opportunities for people to meet, work and recreate without a car. It includes higher-density, multistory residential buildings, second- and third-story apartments and lofts over ground floor commercial and office uses, convenience shopping, personal services, entertainment, office and civic functions, and neighborhood cafes. The community core is also within walking distance of some neighborhoods, and easily accessible to more distant neighborhoods by electric cart, bicycle, automobile and transit. Figure 27 shows a possible schematic design consistent with the Vineyards SP, which may be altered as individual sites are developed. 

Figure 27 Vineyards at Anderson Village Center

Figure 28 Village Center
B.  Requirements. Design components shall be consistent with the Vineyards SP as described in Section 8.5. Development will provide a concentrated pedestrian-scaled urban setting by building to the sidewalk, making building fronts "permeable" and interesting with windows and doors every twenty-five feet, and encouraging sidewalk uses and patios along streets rather than narrow sidewalks and parking. 

Figure 29 Mixed-Use Buildings
C.  Allowed Uses. 
1.  Residential uses are permitted including high-density multiple-family uses. 
2.  Ground floor commercial uses in multifamily units are preferred in the core area and on entry streets.

b.  Where buildings are set back or open space fronts primary streets or entries, landscape features such as strong planting treatments, trellises, arcades, or decorative walls shall reinforce the street edge. 
c.  Maximum setback lines are measured from the edge of the dedicated right-of-way line of streets. 
d.  Setbacks establish minimum or maximum distance between a building and another building at the edge of adjacent dedicated right-of-way or other property lines. 
e.  Setbacks shall be proportionate to the scale of the building, and building façades may be staggered for visual and functional variety and to create usable public spaces. 
f.  Setbacks and building regulations are shown in Table 1 at the end of this section. 
4.  Building Height and Massing. 
a.  Height. Two-story buildings are required on the entry street and primary streets. See Table 1 at the end of this section. 
b.  Variety. Building heights and spacing may be varied to prevent continuous "walls" of closely-spaced masses that block views or create wind tunnels and shadowy "canyons". Variation may be used to contribute to the architectural character and "skyline" of the mixed use area. (SP Policy 8.5.19) 
c.  Horizontal Lines. Boxy, monolithic appearances shall be avoided by visually breaking up the horizontal mass of wide buildings. 
d.  Sun Angles. Sun angles shall be considered in the design and placement of buildings and structures to allow sunlight into deep spaces and to provide for both shaded and sunlit public spaces. (SP Policy 8.5.21) 
e.  Fire Protection. Multistory development shall consider the necessity for providing adequate fire protection. Elevator access shall be provided to upper floors as necessary to meet ADA and building code. 
5.  Building Elevations. 
a.  Front/street-facing façades shall reinforce the human scale and distinct character of building through the rhythm and modulation of façade elements, and shall be designed to convey a sense or order and richness through the interplay of light, shadow, color, texture and materials. (SP Policy 8.5.22) 

Figure 36 Mixed-Use Stores
b.  The façades of long buildings visible from public streets shall be designed to incorporate a rhythm that is not repetitious but serves to lend a sense of scale. (SP Policy 8.5.24) 
c.  High-quality building materials shall be used for all building elevations including side and rear façades and a consistent set of materials shall be used for all façades of a building. (SP Policy 8.5.25) 
d.  Recessed window and door openings should be used to create shadow lines and to express differences in materials. (SP Policy 8.5.23) 
e.  Large unrelieved flat surfaces, flush windows and flush doors should be avoided. 
f.  Blank or opaque walls or other edge treatments that present a hostile or impermeable face or appear to be "walling out" the surroundings should be minimized. 
6.  Roofing. 
a.  Individual building roof forms should be integral to the architecture and contribute to the over[all] character of the mixed-use area "skyline." (SP Policy 8.5.26) 
b.  Angled or arc-form rooflines, material/detail variations and/or iconic features are encouraged to articulate the building profile. (SP Policy 8.5.27) 
c.  Boxy, monolithic buildings with flat tops should be minimized, as should color changes between roof and the rest of the building. 
d.  Roof materials should be high quality and nonreflective, and may not consist of galvanized steel or similar materials. (SP Policy 8.5.28) 
7.  Parking. Parking shall conform to Section 8.5.4 of the Vineyards SP and Table 1 at the end of this section. 
8.  Signs (Section 17.44.050). 
a.  General Requirements. Signs shall conform to Section 8.9 of the Vineyards SP. Signs act as a component of the streetscape and affect the overall perception and ambience of the public realm. Thus, signs should not only communicate the type and quality of goods and services a business provides, or the type of activity(ies) being conducted within a building, but also contribute to, and be an integral part of, the streetscape design and ambience. Signs shall include generally recognized logos rather than printed text whenever possible. The architecture and design of a building typically suggests appropriate locations for signage based on the layout and composition of the building façade. 
Signs shall: 
 Be architecturally compatible with the proposed development style and compatible with the surrounding physical and visual character of the area; 
 Promote the "individuality" of establishments; 
 Identify the business clearly and attractively; 
 Enhance the building on which it is located; and 
 Reduce the amount of visual clutter caused by excessive and poorly placed signage. 
Location and Placement. 
 Avoid sign placements that obstruct building details. 
 Signs that extend beyond, or above, a building façade (except as part of an architectural feature, awning, or other design feature of a building) shall be discouraged unless such signs are designed to integrate with the architecture of a building and the building façade.

(Ord. No. 766, § 2(Exh. B), 6-15-2010) 
17.33.070 - Commercial areas. 
A.  Purpose. Most commercial uses in the Vineyards SP will be located in the mixed-use areas. The neighborhood commercial areas designated in the Vineyards SP are intended for convenience stores, mini-storage, RV storage and other uses not allowed in the mixed-use area. Thus, landscaping to buffer these areas is of prime importance. (SP Section 8.6) Placement of structures should consider topography of the site, trees to be saved and the adjacent land uses. 
B.  Uses Allowed. The uses allowed will be governed by the Vineyards SP Section 8.6. The plan allows different types of commercial uses in the different areas depending on the size and location within the community. Uses which are necessary for the community according to the Vineyards SP will be allowed as long as they are properly landscaped and unpleasant views are screened. 
C.  Site Planning. 
1.  Clustering creates plazas or pedestrian malls and can prevent long "barracks-like" rows of structures; therefore, clustering of buildings should be considered in larger, multibuilding commercial area developments. 
2.  Where clustering is impractical, a visual link between separate structures should be established through the use of an arcade system, trellis, or other open structure and by pavement and landscape treatments. 
3.  Public plazas and landscape areas should reflect careful planning and not simply be "leftover" areas. 
4.  Public plazas and landscape areas shall provide pedestrian amenities such as shade, benches, and fountains. 
5.  Freestanding, singular commercial structures should be oriented with their major entry toward the street where access is provided, as well as having their major façade parallel to the street unless located on a plaza. 
6.  Façades facing a street shall incorporate windows, trellises, wall articulation, landscape, or other features and shall not be a blank wall. 
7.  Buildings should be oriented to pedestrians by placing buildings closer to the street and incorporating a storefront appearance with ample windows, transparent doors and similar storefront techniques. 
D.  Parking and Circulation. 
1.  Pedestrian access shall be an integral part of the site plan and there should be distinct pedestrian access from parking areas to residential, commercial and office uses and between such uses. 
2.  Pedestrian walkways shall parallel driveways in parking areas if possible. 
3.  Pedestrian walkways from building entries shall be provided for pedestrian access to public sidewalks. 
4.  Parking aisles shall be separated from vehicle circulation routes. 
5.  Parking spaces shall not directly abut the commercial structure and parking areas shall be separated from structures by either a raised concrete walkway or landscaped strip, preferably both. 
6.  An opaque wall, berm, topographical difference or landscape shall be used to screen any parking at the street periphery. (SP Policy 8.6.4) 
7.  Commercial parking access points, whether located on front or side streets, shall be located a minimum safe distance from street intersections so that adequate stacking room is provided. 
8.  The number of access points shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary to provide adequate circulation, and shall be at least one hundred feet apart. 
9.  Common driveways which provide vehicular access to more than one site and shared parking facilities are encouraged.

2.  All building-mounted fixtures, other than architectural lighting, shall be fully shielded to eliminate the upward distribution of light. Floodlighting is discouraged and, if used, must be shielded to prevent: (1) light trespass beyond the property line and (2) light above a ninety-degree, horizontal plane. 
D.  Residential Lighting/Glare. 
1.  Permanent outdoor lighting shall be twelve feet or less in height unless it meets one or more of the following criteria: 
a.  Fully shielded with a nonadjustable mounting; or 
b.  Lighting for parking and vehicle circulation areas in which case heights up to a maximum of twenty feet may be allowed; or 
c.  Building-mounted lighting directed back at house numbering or building façade. 
2.  Lighting on above-grade decks or balconies shall be fully shielded. 
3.  Outdoor lighting with HID light sources in excess of thirty-five watts (bulb or lamp) shall be prohibited. In addition, incandescent light sources including halogen shall not exceed fifty watts. 
4.  All light sources that are not fully shielded shall use other than a clear lens material, as the primary lens material, to enclose the light bulb to minimize glare from a point source. 
5.  Landscape lighting is limited to thirty-five watts per fixture per one hundred fifty square feet of landscaped area (as measured in a horizontal plane). 
6.  Security lights shall be restricted as follows: 
a.  The point light source shall not be visible from adjoining lots or streets. 
b.  Floodlights must be controlled by a switch or preferably a motion sensor activated only by motion within the owner's property. 
c.  Timer-controlled floodlights shall be prohibited. 
7.  Photo-cell lights shall be allowed under the following circumstances: 
a.  At primary points of entrance (e.g., front entries) or in critical common areas for multifamily properties; 
b.  Where the light sources are fully shielded by opaque material (i.e., the fixture illuminates the area but is not itself visibly bright); and 
c.  The light source shall be fluorescent (or compact fluorescent) to eliminate excess electricity consumption. 
d.  Lights must be fully shielded, down directed and screened from adjacent properties in a manner that limits light trespass to 0.1 of a footcandle as measured at the property line. 
e.  Light intensity shall not exceed ten footcandles measured three feet above finished grade. 
8.  Building-mounted floodlights shall be fully shielded and downward directed using a light of fifty watts or less. 
9.  Motion sensor lights may be permitted, but only where the sensor is triggered by motion within the owner's property lines. 
10.  Light trespass at property lines should not exceed 0.1 of a footcandle as measured at the brightest point. 
11.  Exterior lighting shall be directed downward and away from adjacent properties and the public right-of-way. 
    The use of highly-reflective materials, including unpainted metal roofing, shall be restricted in order to ensure that glare not be visible beyond property boundaries.

Chapter 17.36 - REDDING MUNICIPAL AIRPORT HAZARD ZONING ORDINANCE 

17.36.010 - Findings and authority. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by California State Airport Approaches Zoning Law. It is found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of Redding Municipal Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of area available for the landing, takeoff, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of Redding Municipal Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: 
A.  That the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the region served by the Redding Municipal Airport; 
B.  That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and 
C.  That the prevention of these hazards should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. 
    It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land.

17.36.030 - Airport zones. 
    In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the approach zones, transitional zones, horizontal zones, and conical zones as they apply to a particular airport. Such zones are shown on Redding municipal airport hazard zoning map consisting of one sheet, prepared by the Shasta County Planning commission, and dated January, 1973, which is attached to the ordinance codified in this title, one copy of which is on file in the city planning department, and made a part thereof. An area located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are established and defined as follows: 
A.  Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is one thousand feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet from the primary surface. Its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
B.  Visual Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred feet at the horizontal distance of five thousand feet from the primary surface. Its centerline being the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
C.  Transitional Zones. These zones are established as the area beneath the transitional surfaces. These surfaces extend outward and upward at ninety degree angles to the runway centerline extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from the sides of the primary and approach surfaces. Transitional zones for those portions of the precision approach zones which project through and beyond the limits of the conical surface, extend a distance of five thousand feet measured horizontally from the edge of the approach zones and at ninety degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
D.  Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of ten thousand feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway, and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
E.  Conical Zone, the conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand feet. The conical zone does not include the precision instrument approach zones and the transitional zones.

17.36.060 - Nonconforming uses. 
A.  Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this chapter, and is diligently prosecuted. 
B.  Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the county to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport, the presence of such airport hazards.

(Ord. 515 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
17.36.070 - Permits. 
A.  Future Uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. 
1.  However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than seventy-five feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of four thousand two hundred feet from each end of the runway except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. 
2.  Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
B.  Existing Uses. no permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of any airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
C.  Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever the county determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
D.  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary harship and relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but will do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter. 
E.  Hazard Marking and Lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the city of Redding, at the expense of the permittee, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to pilots the presence of any airport hazard. 
(Ord. 515 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987)

Chapter 17.43 - RESIDENTIAL DENSITY BONUS 

17.43.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to provide incentives consistent with state law, for the construction of housing units that are affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income persons and families. Further, it serves to provide incentives for the construction of housing units that are of unique design quality and configuration (e.g., clustered housing). 
    A density bonus is an increase over the otherwise maximum residential density allowable under the zoning ordinance and the general plan. It provides developers an opportunity to increase the number of units within a proposed residential development in exchange for including within the project a specified number of units that are affordable to very low-, low-, or moderate-income persons and families and/or units that are of unique design quality and configuration. State law also allows the city to provide incentives other than, or in addition to, an increase in density for affordable housing if requested by an applicant. Accordingly, the purposes of this chapter are to: 
1.  Establish procedures for allowing an increase in density above the maximum residential density allowed by the general plan and zoning ordinance. 
2.  Provide for flexibility in applying zoning regulations and development standards in order to facilitate the development of affordable housing and/or housing of unique design quality and configuration. 
3.  Provide incentives to developers to encourage the inclusion of affordable housing within residential projects. 
4.  Encourage architectural diversity in order to avoid monotonous and repetitive subdivision design and appearance. 
5.  Preserve and enhance neighborhood appearance through creative building design, use of materials, landscaping, and street layout. 
6.  Achieve compatibility within the subdivision design and surrounding neighborhoods. 
7.  Implement the goals and policies of the general plan relative to providing housing opportunities and meeting community housing needs. 
(Ord. No. 771, Exh. C, 6-7-2011)

(Ord. No. 771, Exh. C, 6-7-2011) 
17.43.030 - Implementation. 
    A developer of a housing development may qualify for a density bonus and at least one other incentive as provided by this chapter if the developer does one of the following and complies with the affordability requirements of this chapter: 
1.  Agrees to construct and maintain at least twenty percent of the total units of the housing development as units affordable to low-income households; or 
2.  Agrees to construct and maintain at least ten percent of the total units of the housing development as units affordable to very low-income households; or 
3.  Agrees to construct and maintain a senior citizen housing development. 
    In determining the minimum number of density bonus units to be granted pursuant to this section for affordable housing, the maximum residential density for the site shall be multiplied by 0.25. When calculating the number of permitted density bonus units, any fractions of units shall be rounded to the next larger integer. 
    In determining the number of affordable units to be provided pursuant to this section, the maximum residential density shall be multiplied by 0.10 where very low-income households are targeted, or by 0.20 where lower income households are targeted. The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the total number of affordable units in the housing development. When calculating the required number of affordable units, any resulting decimal fraction shall be rounded to the next larger integer. 
    In cases where a density increase of less than twenty-five percent for affordable housing is requested, no reduction will be allowed in the number of affordable units required. In cases where a density increase of more than twenty-five percent for affordable housing is requested, the requested density increase, if granted, shall be considered an additional incentive, as outlined in Section 17.43.050. 
    In cases where the developer agrees to construct more than twenty percent of the total units for lower income households, or more than ten percent of the total units for very low-income households, the developer may be entitled to only one density bonus and an additional incentive (or an equivalent financial incentive) pursuant to Section 17.43.050 of this chapter. Similarly, a developer who agrees to construct senior citizen housing with twenty or ten percent of the units reserved for lower or very low-income persons and families, respectively, may only be entitled to one density bonus and an additional incentive. The city may, however, grant multiple additional incentives to facilitate the inclusion of more affordable units than are required by this chapter. 
    Further, a developer of a housing development may qualify for a density bonus and at least one other incentive, as provided by this chapter, if the developer agrees to employ architectural diversity within the subdivision and/or utilize unique subdivision design components. 
    In order to ensure that that the density bonus for quality housing design does not conflict with, or undermine the purpose of, the affordable/senior housing density bonus, the city will limit the density bonus for quality housing design to ten percent of the maximum base density permitted in the zone in which a residential project is proposed. If the project is proposed in a commercial zone, the density bonus will be no more than ten percent of the maximum density permitted in the R-3 zone. 
(Ord. No. 771, Exh. C, 6-7-2011) 
17.43.040 - Development standards. 
    Affordable units should be constructed concurrently with market-rate units unless both the city and the developer agree within the affordable housing agreement to an alternative schedule for development. 
    Affordable units shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated group for a period of thirty years (or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program), under the following circumstances: 
1.  Both a density bonus and an additional incentive is granted; or 
2.  An equivalent financial incentive equivalent to a density bonus and an additional incentive is granted. 
    Affordable units shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated group for a period of ten years under the following circumstances: 
1.  Only a density bonus is granted and no additional incentives are granted; or 
2.  An equivalent financial incentive equivalent to only a density bonus is granted. 
    In determining the maximum affordable rent or affordable sales price of affordable units the following household and unit size assumptions shall be used, unless the housing development is subject to different assumptions imposed by other governmental regulations: 
SRO (residential hotel unit): 0.75 person 
0 bedroom (studio): 1 person 
1 bedroom: 2 persons 
2 bedrooms: 3 persons 
3 bedrooms: 4 persons 
4 bedrooms: 6 persons 
    Affordable units should be built onsite wherever possible and, when practical, be dispersed within the housing development. Where feasible, the number of bedrooms of the affordable units should be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the market-rate units of the housing development; except that the developer may include a higher proportion of affordable units with more bedrooms. The design and appearance of the affordable units shall be compatible with the design of the total housing development. Housing developments shall comply with all applicable development standards, except those which may be modified as provided by this chapter. 
    Circumstances may arise in which the public interest would be served by allowing some or all of the affordable units associated with one housing development to be produced and operated at an alternative development site. Where the developer and the city form such an agreement, the resulting linked developments shall be considered a single housing development for purposes of this chapter. Under these circumstances, the developer shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter for the affordable units to be provided on the alternative site. 
    An affordable housing agreement shall be made a condition of the discretionary planning permits (e.g., tract maps, parcel maps, site plans, planned development or conditional use permits, etc.) for all housing developments pursuant to this chapter. The agreement shall be recorded as a restriction on the parcel or parcels on which the affordable units will be constructed. The agreement shall be consistent with Section 17.43.070. 
(Ord. No. 771, Exh. C, 6-7-2011) 
17.43.050 - Development incentives. 
    The city may provide a density bonus and an additional incentive, for qualified housing developments, upon the written request of a developer, unless the city makes a written finding that the additional incentive is not necessary to make the housing development economically feasible and to accommodate a density bonus. 
    The development incentives granted for affordable housing shall contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of providing the affordable units. Applicants seeking a waiver or modification of development or zoning standards shall show that such waivers or modifications are necessary to make the housing development economically feasible in accordance with Government Code Section 65915(e). This requirement may be satisfied by reference to applicable sections of the city's general plan. 
    The need for incentives will vary for different housing developments. Therefore, the allocation of additional incentives shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. The additional incentives may include, but are not limited to, any of the following: 
1.  A reduction of site development standards or a modification of zoning code or architectural design requirements which exceed the minimum building standards provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the California Health and Safety Code. 
These may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: 
a)  Reduced minimum lot sizes and/or dimensions. 
b)  Reduced minimum lot setbacks. 
c)  Reduced minimum outdoor and/or private outdoor living area. 
d)  Increased maximum lot coverage. 
e)  Increased maximum building height and/or stories. 
f)  Reduced onsite parking standards, including the number or size of spaces and garage requirements. 
g)  Reduced minimum building separation requirements. 
h)  Reduced street standard (e.g., reduced minimum street widths). 
i)  Reduced percentage of lot area required to be set aside for landscaping. 
2.  Allow the housing development to include nonresidential uses and/or allow the housing development within a nonresidential zone. 
3.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the developer or the city which result in identifiable cost reductions or avoidance. 
4.  A density bonus of more than twenty-five percent. 
5.  Waived, reduced, or deferred planning, plan check, construction permit, and/or development impact fees (e.g., capital facilities, park, or traffic fees). 
6.  Direct financial aid (e.g., redevelopment set aside, community development block grant funding) in the form of a loan or a grant to subsidize or provide low interest financing for onsite or offsite improvements, land or construction costs. 
    The city may offer an equivalent financial incentive for affordable housing in lieu of granting a density bonus and an additional incentive. The value of the equivalent financial incentive shall equal at least the land cost per dwelling unit savings that would result from a density bonus and must contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of providing the affordable units pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 771, Exh. C, 6-7-2011) 
17.43.060 - Application requirements and review. 
    An application pursuant to this chapter shall be processed concurrently with any other applications required for the housing development. Final approval or disapproval of an application, with right of appeal to the city council, shall be made by the planning commission unless direct financial assistance is requested. If direct financial assistance is requested, the planning commission shall make a recommendation to the city council, which will have the authority to make the final decision on the application. 
    An applicant/developer proposing a housing development pursuant to this chapter may submit a preliminary application prior to the submittal of any formal request for approval of a housing development. Applicants are encouraged to schedule a pre-application conference with the planning director or designated staff to discuss and identify potential application issues, including prospective additional incentives pursuant to Section 17.43.050. No charge will be required for the pre-application conference. A preliminary application shall include the following information: 
1.  A brief description of the proposed housing development, including the total number of units, affordable units (as applicable), and density bonus units proposed. 
2.  The zoning and general plan designations and assessor's parcel numbers of the project site. 
3.  A vicinity map and preliminary site plan, drawn to scale, including building footprints, driveway and parking layout.

It is the intent of this section to recognize that the eventual elimination of existing signs that are not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter is as much a subject to health, safety and welfare, including aesthetic values, as is the prohibition of new signs that would violate the provisions of this chapter. Elimination of such nonconforming signs shall also prevent conforming signs from being obstructed. It is also the intent of this section that any elimination of nonconforming signs shall be effected so as to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established property rights as established by law. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  A nonconforming sign may not be: 
a.  Changed to another nonconforming sign; 
b.  Structurally altered so as to extend its useful life; 
c.  Expanded; 
d.  Reestablished after removal; 
e.  Reestablished after discontinuance of use; 
f.  Reestablished after damage or destruction of more that fifty percent of the value. 
2.  All illegal signs shall be removed or made to conform to this chapter. 
3.  When the designation of any freeway is changed to a landscaped freeway, all such nonappurtenant advertising structures designed to be seen from the freeway shall be removed within one year from the date of such change.

(Ord. 515 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
17.48.040 - Action by planning commission. 
A.  At the conclusion of a public hearing, the planning commission shall make written findings of fact showing whether the qualifications of this chapter apply to the land, building or use for which variance is sought, and whether such variance shall be in harmony with the general purpose of Chapters 17.02 through 17.52.

Chapter 17.50 - USE PERMIT 

17.50.010 - Generally.

(Ord. 515 § 1 Exh. A (part), 1987) 
17.50.020 - Application. 
A.  All applications for a use permit shall be filed with the planning department and shall be in the form and contain the information prescribed by the planning director.

    In order to expedite permit processing for certain routine and simple use permits, the city distinguishes between administrative use permits and conditional use permits. 
A.  Administrative use permits are approved by the planning director and are for those uses which have lesser impacts and need less intensive review, such as overheight fences, special retail permits, garage conversions, or those uses which already conform to the city's general plan and zoning ordinance, and are categorically exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act. 
B.  After the review of the application and determination that it is complete and appropriate for an administrative use permit, the planning director shall make a determination to either approve, conditionally approve, or deny the administrative use permit. If the planning director determines to approve or conditionally approve an administrative use permit, notice of intent to approve administrative use permit shall be mailed to the applicant and those owners whose names and addresses appear on the county tax rolls adopted the previous January 1st as owning property within a distance of not less than three hundred feet from the exterior boundaries of the parcel which is the subject of the hearing. Those owners shall have five days to comment and/or protest, in writing the approval of the permit. The planning director's decision shall be final unless appealed. The decision shall state the conditions of approval, if any, or the reasons for denial. 
C.  The planning director may refer an administrative use permit to the planning commission, pursuant to the requirements in subsection A of this section, when the planning director determines the application involves a major policy issue or public controversy that would be resolved more suitably by the planning commission. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2006) 
17.50.028 - Administrative use permit appeal. 
    In any case, where an interested party is not satisfied with the action of the planning director, they may, within five days of such action by the planning director, appeal in writing, to the planning commission. Upon receipt of such notice of appeal, the secretary of the planning commission shall set a date for a public hearing and shall provide notice of such hearing in accordance with Section 17.50.030. Approvals will be effective on a Monday with the appeal period closing at five p.m. on the following Friday. In the case of a holiday falling within the appeal period the appeal period will close at five p.m. on the next working day. The planning commission shall render its decision within sixty days after the filing of such appeal. 
(Ord. 744 § 1 (part), 2006) 
17.50.030 - Conditional use permits. 
    After review of the application and determination that it is completed by the planning director and/or requires a conditional use permit, the planning director, on behalf of the planning commission, sets the application for a public hearing before the commission, notice of which shall be given at least ten days prior to such hearing by publication in a local newspaper of general circulation in the city, and at least ten days prior to such hearing shall be sent through the United States mails to all persons whose names and addresses appear on the county tax rolls adopted the previous January 1st as owning property within a distance of not less than three hundred feet from the exterior boundaries of the parcel which is the subject of the hearing.

2.  The proposed use will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood of the proposed use; and 
3.  The proposed use will not be detrimental or injurious to the general welfare of the city; and 
4.  The proposed use is consistent with the general plan and any specific plans adopted for the applicable area and in conformity with the most restrictive designations, policies and provisions of such plans should such plans, or maps contained therein, differ in any respect from one another. 
B.  The planning commission may designate such conditions in connection with approval of the use permit as it deems necessary to secure the purposes of this title and may require such guarantee or evidences that such conditions are being or will be complied with.

2.  Ownership. An accessory dwelling unit shall not be sold separately from the one-family residence on the same lot but may be leased or rented provided the lease or rental is for thirty consecutive days or longer. 
3.  Reserved. 
4.  Size. The floor area for the accessory unit shall not be less than four hundred square feet nor shall it exceed one thousand two hundred square feet. Attached units shall not exceed a maximum of fifty percent of the size of the living space of the primary dwelling. Where fifty percent of the living space of the primary dwelling is less than six hundred forty square feet, the living space of a detached accessory dwelling unit may be up to six hundred forty square feet. 
5.  Development Standards. All new construction shall conform to the height, setback, lot coverage, fees and other zoning requirements otherwise applicable to residential construction in the zone in which the property is located. The following standards are also applicable to the construction of accessory residential units. Where there is a conflict between the standards of the zoning district and those that follow, the least restrictive standard shall apply: 
a.  New Detached Units. 
(1)  New detached accessory dwelling units shall not be located within a required setback. Building encroachments of up to two feet that are required to achieve compliance with building or fire code standards may be approved by the director where it can be shown that the encroachment is necessary to achieve compliance with California Government Code § 65852.2 and the intent of this chapter. 
(b)  Units within or attached to an existing structure: 
(1)  Accessory units constructed entirely within a legally existing structure may be located within a required setback. Modifications to such structures where required to meet building or fire code standards may be approved by the director where it can be shown that compliance with the standard would make the project infeasible. Compliance with the standards of the underlying zoning district for the side and rear lot lines shall not be required for a new accessory dwelling unit that is constructed above a legally established garage or residential accessory building. 
6.  Building Code Compliance. California building code requirements which apply to additions to existing single-family dwellings, as appropriate, will apply to accessory dwelling units. 
7.  Fire Code Compliance. The accessory dwelling unit shall meet all requirements of the fire protection district, as applicable, for the lot on which the unit is located, including adequate access to the accessory dwelling unit for emergency personnel and equipment. Accessory dwelling units constructed within an existing residence shall not be required to provide fire sprinklers if they are not required for the primary residence. 
8.  Impact Fees. Public facility development impact fees for an accessory dwelling unit shall be calculated at the same rate as one unit in a multiple-family residential development. Payment of public facility development impact fees shall not be required where the accessory dwelling unit is constructed entirely within an existing structure, and such unit does not have a separate sewer lateral which connects to the city wastewater system or a separate water meter. Payment of public facility development impact fees otherwise required for a residential unit may be waived by the director where the detached or attached accessory dwelling unit does not have a separate sewer lateral which connects to the city wastewater system or a separate water meter. 
9.  Septic Systems. Approval by the county environmental health department is required where a private sewage disposal system is being used. 
10.  Number of Accessory Dwelling Units. There shall be no more than one accessory dwelling unit per legal lot. 
11.  Parking. Off-street parking requirements for an accessory dwelling unit shall be one additional parking space for a studio or one-bedroom unit, and two additional spaces for a unit with two or more bedrooms. Such parking may be provided as tandem parking on an existing driveway. Where the accessory unit is constructed within an area of existing covered parking required for the use of the primary residence by this code, the replacement spaces may be located in any configuration on the same lot as the accessory dwelling unit, including but not limited to a covered space, uncovered space, or tandem space which meets the dimensional and access standards of Chapter 17.46, "Off-Street Parking Requirements". Parking shall otherwise comply with California Government Code § 65852.2(d) and all other applicable provisions of this code. 
C.  Exceptions. Exceptions may be granted to the development standards set forth in this section if an administrative design review approval is obtained and the following findings are made by the director: 
1.  The proposed exception from the development standard(s) is necessary due to physical or other constraints on the lot that make the strict application of the standard(s) impractical or inconsistent with existing development on the lot or in the immediate neighborhood; and 
2.  The proposed exception from the development standard(s) would not result in a health or safety hazard for existing and future residents on the lot or in the immediate neighborhood.

(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. 1 (part)), 1998) 
17.64.060 - Environmental determination. 
A.  Environmental Review Committee. An environmental review committee, composed of the community and economic development director, the public works director, and the chair of the planning commission or designee, may review initial studies, approve draft negative declarations, and determine the need for an EIR. Meetings of the committee shall be noticed seventy-two hours in advance and public hearings before the committee shall be noticed as required by local and state law. 
B.  Initial Study. If it is determined that a project is not exempt and is subject to CEQA, the community and economic development director shall complete an initial study to determine whether a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report (EIR) is to be prepared. If the director determines that an EIR clearly will be required for a project, an expanded initial study may be conducted to better focus the EIR on important environmental issues. 
    The initial study report shall be a written environmental determination in the form of an initial study checklist on file with the community and economic development director and is in compliance with Section 15063 of the CEQA Guidelines. If necessary, an extended initial study may be prepared to document the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment. Thresholds of significance shall be determined as based on CEQA, the Anderson general plan, and other regulatory documents or permit requirements. The extended initial study may also discuss methods to mitigate any potentially significant effects of the proposed project and provide a discussion regarding consistency with existing zoning, general plan and other applicable land use regulations. 
    Upon completion of an initial study or expanded initial study, the community and economic development director or environmental review committee shall make an environmental determination as to whether a draft negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report is to be prepared. 
(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. 1 (part)), 1998) 
17.64.070 - Negative declaration. 
A.  Upon selection of the appropriate environmental determination, the community and economic development director staff shall prepare a draft negative declaration for a project when the initial study demonstrates that there is no substantial evidence that the project will have a significant effect on the environment. 
B.  Where the community and economic development director determines that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the director may propose modifications to the project which would mitigate the potential effects to a level of "less than significant." If such mitigation measures are agreed to in advance by the project proponent and are incorporated into the project or made a condition of the project, the community and economic development director may prepare a draft mitigated negative declaration. 
C.  As required by Section 20191 of the Public Resources Code, the community and economic development director shall provide at least a twenty-calendar day public review period for a draft negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration from the date the notice of intent to adopt is postmarked. When a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration is submitted to the state clearinghouse for review by state agencies, the review period shall not be less than thirty calendar days from the date the document is distributed by the clearinghouse. Pursuant to the provisions of Public Resources Code Section 20191 of the statutes, the community and economic development director is authorized to request a shortened review period. The proposed negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration shall be kept on file at the office of the community and economic development director to provide an opportunity for public review. 
D.  The public notice of availability of a proposed negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration shall be mailed to all property owners within three hundred feet of the exterior property boundaries of the subject property using the ownership names and addresses from the latest available Shasta County tax assessor rolls. The notice shall contain the name of the applicant, the location of the project, a brief description of the project, the location where the proposed negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration can be reviewed, and the date ending the public review period. 
E.  Prior to approving a project, the city shall consider the proposed negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration together with any comments received during the public review period. The city shall approve the negative declaration if it finds, on the basis of the initial study and comments received, that there is not any substantial evidence that the project will have a significant effect on the environment. 
F.  With a private project, the negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration must be completed and ready for approval within one hundred five calendar days from the date when the city accepted the application as complete. The city shall act on permit applications for projects for which a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration has been prepared within three months after the negative declaration is approved. 
G.  After the city decides to carry out or approve a project for which a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration has been approved, the community and economic development director may file a notice of determination with the Shasta County clerk within five working days. The contents of the notice of determination shall comply with Section 15075 of the State CEQA Guidelines. Notices of determination shall be mailed to requesting parties if such request is made within the thirty-calendar day statute of limitations on court challenges to the approval under CEQA. If a notice of determination is not filed by the city with the county clerk, a one hundred eighty-day statute of limitation will apply. 
(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. 1 (part)), 1998) 
17.64.080 - Environmental impact report (EIR) preparation. 
A.  Initiation. Upon completion of the initial study and a determination by the community and economic development director that the EIR is required, the director shall initiate the EIR process as described in this chapter. The EIR process should be consolidated, to the extent possible, with the existing planning, review and approval process. 
B.  Notice of Preparation. Upon a determination by the city that an EIR is required, the community and economic development director shall prepare a notice of preparation (NOP) pursuant to Section 15082 of the State CEQA Guidelines. The director may require the project proponent to provide information necessary for preparation of the NOP. 
    The community and economic development director shall send the NOP to each responsible or trustee agency. In addition the community and economic development director may identify other relevant groups or agencies and distribute the NOP to these groups. The director shall use either certified mail or other method of transmittal which provides a record that the NOP was received. A period of thirty calendar days from the receipt of the NOP shall be provided for comment. When one or more state agencies will be a responsible agency or a trustee agency, the director shall send an NOP to each state responsible agency and trustee agency with a copy sent to the state clearinghouse. 
C.  Issues in an EIR. During or subsequent to the NOP review period, a meeting may be convened by the community and economic development director. The meeting shall involve representatives from pertinent agencies, in order to clarify and focus the issues to be addressed in the draft EIR. 
D.  Preparation of the Draft EIR. When an EIR is required for a project, the community and economic development director shall be responsible for preparation of the draft document. The draft EIR may be prepared by an environmental consultant in a format specified by the city. If environmental documentation is prepared under contract to the city, the contract shall be executed within forty-five days of the determination that the environmental documentation is required. 
E.  Acceptance of the Draft EIR for Circulation. Upon completion of the draft EIR, the consultant for the EIR shall submit a specified number of copies of an administrative draft for review by the community and economic development director. The director shall review the administrative draft and make changes as necessary to reflect the independent judgment of the director and to ensure that the document adequately and objectively discloses any potential environmental effects of the proposed project. 
    This review should be conducted within fourteen calendar days of the date of submittal of the draft EIR. Where corrections or changes are found necessary by the director, a revised administrative draft shall then be prepared. As soon as the revised draft EIR is prepared and accepted by the community and economic development director as adequate under CEQA, a specified number of copies of the circulation draft EIR, together with one original copy, shall be filed with the director.

    The community and economic development director shall provide notice of the public review for the draft EIR upon filing of the notice of completion with the state clearinghouse per Section 15087 of the State CEQA Guidelines. Direct notice shall be given to all organizations or individuals who have previously requested such notice. If a state agency is a responsible or trustee agency, ten copies of the draft EIR shall be provided to the state clearinghouse. 
    Comments received as part of the public review should be in writing and should focus on environmental issues related to the project and adequacy of the EIR. The community and economic development director may schedule a public hearing before the environmental review committee or the planning commission during or upon completion of the public review period for the purposes of receiving public comments on the draft EIR. The public hearings may be held at the regular time and place of planning commission meetings, or they may be held at another established place and time convenient to that portion of the general public most interested in the project for which the public hearing is being conducted. 
B.  Response to Comments on a Draft EIR. The community and economic development director shall evaluate comments on environmental issues received during the noticed public review period and shall prepare written responses. The responses shall comply with the requirements described in Section 15088 of the CEQA Guidelines.

2.  The city has: 
a.  Eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment, where feasible, as shown in findings under Section 15091 of CEQA, 
b.  Determined that any remaining significant effects on the environment found to be unavoidable under Section 15091 of CEQA are acceptable due to overriding concerns as described in Section 15093 of CEQA. 
E.  Statement of Overriding Considerations. If the city determines that the benefits of a proposed project substantially outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects, the city shall make a statement of overriding considerations in approving the project. The city shall state specific reasons to support its action based on the certified final EIR and additional evidence if presented for the record. 
F.  Time Limits. With a private project, the city shall complete and certify the final EIR within one year after the date the project application was accepted as complete. An unreasonable delay by an applicant in meeting requests by the city necessary for the preparation of an EIR shall suspend the running of the time period for the period of the unreasonable delay.

(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. 1 (part)), 1998) 
17.64.140 - Fees and bonds. 
A.  An applicant for a private project, which is determined not to be exempt from the provisions of CEQA, shall pay environmental review fee at the time of application as set by city council resolution. It is the intent of the city council that this fee be interpreted to include costs complying with the CEQA process with the exception of the cost for EIR preparation and processing as set by city council resolution. 
B.  If the determination is made that an EIR must be prepared for a private project, the applicant proposing the project shall pay the EIR processing fees as set by city council resolution. The environmental review fee shall be credited to the EIR processing fee. The EIR processing fee shall cover the estimated costs incurred by the city in reviewing and processing the EIR. The fees shall be payable prior to review of the first draft EIR by staff of the community and economic development director. 
C.  To guarantee that the city has the resources to carry out the mitigation monitoring and reporting program, the planning commission or city council may require the project proponent to post a cash bond or other specific assurity acceptable to the city attorney at the time the project is approved or is to be carried out. The assurity would be used to cover the cost of staff time in meeting the requirements of a mitigation monitoring and reporting program. The assurity would be posted with the city treasurer and all accrued interest would be used to cover administrative handling by the city. Upon completion of the monitoring program, any unused portion of the assurity would be returned to the project proponent. 
D.  The community and economic development director shall establish the costs to purchase each EIR. The cost shall cover reproduction, storage, mailing and handling costs. 
(Ord. 679 § 1 (Exh. 1 (part)), 1998) 
Chapter 17.65 - MEDICAL MARIJUANA CULTIVATION 

17.65.010 - Legislative findings. 
    The city council finds as follows: 
1.  In 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215 which was codified as California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.5, and entitled "The Compassionate Use Act of 1996" ("the Compassionate Use Act" or "CUA"). 
2.  The intent of the Compassionate Use Act was to enable persons who are in need of marijuana for medical purposes to obtain and use it under limited, specific circumstances, without being subject to criminal prosecution under certain state statutes. 
3.  On January 1, 2004, Senate Bill 420, codified as California Health and Safety Code Sections 11362.7 et seq. and entitled "The Medical Marijuana Program," ("MMP") became effective to clarify the scope of the Compassionate Use Act. 
4.  California Health and Safety Code Section 11362.83 expressly allows cities and counties to adopt and enforce ordinances that are consistent with Senate Bill 420. 
5.  The City of Anderson has adopted a zoning plan identified as Title 17 (zoning) of the City of Anderson Municipal Code. 
6.  Prior to the enactment of this section, there were no regulations addressing cultivation of medical marijuana in the zoning plan. 
7.  The City of Anderson with a population of 10,579 (January 1, 2009) is a small town with a high percentage of non-owner occupied residential units. Landlords have complained of damage caused by unauthorized cultivation activities in their rental properties. 
8.  The City of Anderson Police Department, city residents and other public entities have reported adverse impacts from medical marijuana cultivation, including disagreeable odors; increased risk of burglary and other property crimes; and acts of violence in connection with the commission of such crimes or the occupants' attempts to prevent such crimes. 
9.  The creation of persistent strong odors as marijuana plants mature and flower is offensive to many people and creates an attractive nuisance, alerting persons to the location of valuable marijuana plants and creating an increased risk of crime. 
10.  The indoor cultivation of substantial amounts of marijuana also frequently requires excessive use of electricity, which often creates an unreasonable risk of fire from the electrical grow lighting systems used in indoor cultivation. 
11.  Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of marijuana use, and the presence of marijuana plants has proven to be an attractive nuisance for children, creating an unreasonable hazard in areas frequented by children including schools, parks, and other similar locations. 
12.  On October 9, 2015, Governor Brown approved the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act ("MMRSA"), which goes into effect on January 1, 2016, and establishes a comprehensive state licensing and regulatory framework governed by the newly created bureau of medical marijuana regulation, placed within the state department of consumer affairs, for the cultivation, manufacture, transportation, processing, storage, labeling, delivery, transportation, and sale of medical marijuana through Assembly Bills 243 and 266 and Senate Bill 643; and 
13.  The MMRSA specifically addresses the delivery and transportation of medical cannabis. 
14.  The delivery of medical cannabis under the MMRSA means the commercial transfer of medical cannabis from a dispensary to a primary caregiver or patient as defined in Section 11372.7 of the California Health and Safety Code (California Business and Professions Code, Section 19300.5 (b)(3)(m)). 
15.  The MMRSA amends the California Business and Professions Code Section 19340 which states that deliveries of medical cannabis can only be made by a dispensary and in a city, county, or city and county that does not explicitly prohibit delivery of medical cannabis by local ordinance. 
16.  The MMRSA expressly declares that nothing in the MMRSA shall be interpreted to supersede or limit existing local authority for law enforcement activity, enforcement of local zoning requirements or ordinances, or enforcement of local permits or licensing requirements. 
17.  The City of Anderson's Municipal Code does not explicitly and separately prohibit the cultivation of medical marijuana for sale, the delivery of medical marijuana or the processing of medical marijuana; however, Chapter 17.65 (E) has been historically applied to prohibit or preclude these types of activities. 
18.  Prohibiting the cultivation of medical marijuana for sale, the delivery of medical marijuana and the processing of medical marijuana is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community, and to prevent adverse impacts that such uses may have on nearby properties and residence. 
19.  The city council finds and determines that the enactment of this section is exempt from environmental review pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) in that there is nothing in this section or its implementation that could have a foreseeable significant effect on the environment.
