paid within thirty (30) days after mailing of the Notice of Assessment, the same shall be

received on account of such special assessment shall be held by the City Treasurer in a

8-1-10: FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS:
The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter
N, Parts 405-471, or as may be promulgated by the EPA hereafter, are hereby
incorporated by reference. One copy of such standards shall be filed with the City Clerk
and two (2) copies of such standards shall be kept on file at all times in the office of the
Director.
8-1-11: STATE REQUIREMENTS: State requirements and limitations
on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all Users which are subject to such standards
in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations,
or those in this chapter or other applicable chapter.
8-1-12: LOCAL LIMITS: The following pollutant limits are established to
protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits.

(Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end
of the pipe). All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Director may impose mass limitations in addition to (or in place
of) the concentration-based limitations above. Where a User is subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or
applicable pretreatment standard shall apply.
8-1-13: RIGHT OF REVISION: The City reserves the right to establish,
by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements
on discharges to the POTW.
8-1-14: DILUTION: No User shall ever increase the use of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on Users which he believes may
be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
8-1-15: SPECIAL AGREEMENTS: The City reserves the right to enter
into special agreements with Users setting out special terms under which they may
discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a
categorical pretreatment standard or federal pretreatment requirement. However, the User
may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15. They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard
from the approval authority in accordance with 40 CFR 403.13.
8-1-16: APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR WASTEWATER: No User shall
discharge wastewater into the POTW without having first filed an application with the
Director and having obtained a permit to discharge wastewater into the POTW. At the time
of such application, the applicant shall provide sufficient information concerning the nature,
concentration and quantity of his waste or such other information as may be reasonably
necessary for the Director to assure compliance with this chapter. Upon receipt of said
application, the Director shall review the same and if necessary, inspect the property and
facilities of the applicant to determine if said facilities are in compliance with the provisions
of this chapter. Upon making such determination, the Director shall forthwith issue a permit
to the applicant authorizing discharge of waste to the public sewer. All significant industrial
Title 8-1-21
Users shall in addition comply with the provisions of Section 8-1-33 through 8-1-46 of this
chapter. Such permit may be issued upon conditions reasonably necessary to assure
compliance with this chapter, including, but not limited to, the following:
(A) Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(B) Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow
regulations and equalization;
(C) Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and sampling facilities;
(D) Conditions concerning sampling locations, frequency of sampling, number, types
and standards for tests and a reporting schedule therefor;
(E) Compliance schedules;
(F) Periodic submission of technical reports or other discharge reports necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter, and the frequency of monitoring of the
discharge;
(G) Any other condition reasonably necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.
8-1-17: PRETREATMENT FACILITIES: Users shall provide necessary
wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set out in this chapter within
the time limitations specified by the EPA, the State, of the Director, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the User's expense. Detailed plans showing
the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for
review, and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the User from the Responsibility
of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the City under
the provisions of this chapter.
(A) Pretreatment facilities shall not produce odorous gas;
(B) Pretreatment facilities shall not have sewer sludge stored on site for more than 12
hours.
(C) For applicants seeking a permit to discharge ten (10) or more ERU’s, the City
may charge an additional Permit Review Fee in such amounts as the City may
determine from time to time. (Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-18: DEADLINES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE
PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS: Compliance by existing Users covered by
categorical pretreatment standards shall be accomplished within 3 years of the date the
standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the appropriate
standard. The City shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing User
not covered by categorical pretreatment standards or for any categorical User when the
Title 8-1-22
local limits for said User are more restrictive than EPA's categorical pretreatment
standards. New source dischargers and "new Users" are required to comply with
applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time not to exceed 90 days
from the beginning of discharge. New sources and new Users shall install and have in
operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.
Any wastewater discharge permit issued to a categorical User
shall not contain a compliance date beyond any deadline date established in EPA's
categorical pretreatment standards. Any other existing User or a categorical User that
must comply with a more stringent local limit, which is in non-compliance with any local
limits shall be provided with a compliance schedule placed in an industrial wastewater
permit to ensure compliance within the shortest time feasible.
8-1-19: GREASE TRAPS REQUIRED: Whenever a building is used as
a hotel, boarding house or restaurant, the owner or occupant shall provide a grease trap
through which all wastes of a greasy nature shall be drained. Such grease trap shall be
designed to remove all grease and garbage in a manner which allows only wastewater
which complies with this chapter to drain into the sanitary sewer.
8-1-20: INTERCEPTORS REQUIRED TO REMOVE HARMFUL
INGREDIENTS: Grease, oil and sand interceptors or other adequate removal facilities
shall be installed on the premises necessary to remove grease in excessive amounts, high
concentration of blood, fruit, vegetable or grain liquors, milk wastes, or any flammable
wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Director and shall be so located as to be readily and easily accessible for
cleaning and inspection. All interceptors shall be properly and regularly maintained by the
owner or occupant.
8-1-21: CONNECTION TO SANITARY SEWER REQUIRED: Every
building or structure located within the City and from which any wastewater is discharged
shall be connected to the public sanitary sewer if such sewer is within two hundred feet
(200') of such building or structure. All connections to the sewer shall be made at the
expense of the owner or person having control thereof. Any person who fails to make such
connection within ninety (90) days after receiving a notice from the City advising him of the
availability of the sewer, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
8-1-22: SEWER SERVICES;APLICATION AND REVIEW FEE: A
separate and independent sewer service shall be installed for every building using or
required to use the POTW. Separate sewer services are not required for each space in a
travel trailer court. The City of Shelley Wastewater Discharge Permit Application form and
sewer connection review fee(s) shall be adopted by resolution of the City Council and may
be amended and modified from time to time by resolution of the City Council. Applications
submitted without full payment of all applicable review fee(s) will not be considered.
(Ordinance 580 5/10/16)
Title 8-1-23
8-1-23: SEWER SERVICE CONNECTION FEES:
(A) Permits Required: No person shall install or alter any sanitary sewer within the City,
or tap onto or connect to any sanitary sewer line, whether lateral, main or
interceptor, without first obtaining permission from the City.
(B) Sewer Connection Fees: Before permission is issued for the installation or
alteration of any sanitary sewer or before any connection is made to any sanitary
sewer line, whether lateral, main or interceptor, the applicant shall pay to the City a
sewer connection fee. The fees to be imposed shall be adopted by resolution of the
City Council and may be amended and modified from time to time by resolution of
the City Council and the current schedule of charges shall be posted in the office of
the City Clerk and made available to any interested party inquiring concerning
connections.
A separate sewer connection permit must be obtained for each building or trailer
court or cabin court using the sanitary sewer system of the City, and except as
otherwise provided herein, the service connection fee must be paid whenever a
plumbing permit is required by the City. Once the required sewer service
connection fee has been paid for any building connected to the POTW, no further
connection fee shall be charged for the connection of any sewer serving any
building constructed or reconstructed at the same place, or so near the same place
that no substantial extension of the original side sewer is necessary to serve it.
(Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
(C) Sanitary Sewer Capital Improvement Fund: There is hereby established a Sanitary
Sewer Capital Improvement Fund to be supervised and managed by the City
Treasurer. All sewer service connection fees and sewer main fees collected under
this chapter shall be deposited into said Fund and shall be distributed only for the
purposes set forth below.
(D) Disbursement of Funds: Disbursements may be made from the Sanitary Sewer
Capital Improvement Fund for the following purposes only:

private sewer connected to the public sewer becomes obstructed, broken or out of order,
the owner, agent or tenant of such premises shall repair the same at his own expense.
8-1-25: PERMIT REQUIRED TO WORK ON PUBLIC SEWER: No
person shall uncover, disturb, construct, repair or extend any part of the POTW without first
obtaining a sewer service excavation permit. No person shall extend any private sewer or
sewer service beyond the limits of the building or property for which a permit has been
given without obtaining a permit for the desired extension. The issuance of a sewer
service permit shall not be construed to permit any work for which a public right of way
excavation permit is required by this Code.
8-1-26: NOTICE OF INSPECTION: No person shall make connection
to any public sewer without first giving advance notice to the Director at least five (5) hours
prior to the time of making such connection, stating when such work will be ready for
inspection. Any person desiring to lay or drive any pipe in a public street, alley or
easement shall give at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice to the City. Notices given on
any Saturday or legal holiday will not be accepted.

shall damage, break, remove or tamper with any portion of the POTW. No person shall
deposit into the POTW any substance which will likely obstruct the flow of wastewater in
the POTW.
8-1-31: STATE REQUIREMENT: State standards and limitations on
discharges to the POTW shall be met by all Users where such standards are more
stringent than the standards in this or any other applicable chapter.
8-1-32: ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES/SLUG CONTROL PLANS:
(A) The Director may require any User to develop and implement an accidental
discharge/slug control plan ("ASPP"). Where deemed necessary by the City,
Title 8-1-25
facilities to prevent accidental discharge or slug discharges of pollutants shall be
provided and maintained at the User's cost and expense. An accidental spill
prevention plan/slug control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review and approval before
implementation. The City shall determine which User is required to develop a plan
and require said plan to be submitted within 30 days after written notification by the
City that an ASPP is required. Each User shall implement its ASPP as submitted or
as modified after such plan has been reviewed and approved by the City. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve
the User from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
(B) Any User required to develop and implement an ASPP shall submit a plan which
addresses, at a minimum, the following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug
discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which
would violate any of the standards in Sections 8-1-9 through 8-1-12 of this
chapter; and
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.
Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance
of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading
operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of
containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
(C) Users shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon the occurrence of a "slug"
or "accidental discharge" of substances regulated by this chapter. The notification
shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste,
concentration and volume and correlative actions. Any affected User shall be liable
for any expense, loss or damage to the POTW, including the amount of any fines
imposed on the City on account thereof under state or federal law.
(D) Within five (5) days following an accidental discharge, the User shall submit to the
Superintendent a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the User to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the User of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the User of any
fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter or other
Title 8-1-26
applicable law.
(E) Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the User's premises
advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental discharge.
Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge
with respect to emergency notification procedures.
8-1-33: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS: No
significant industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining
a wastewater discharge permit from the Superintendent. Any violation of the terms and
conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this chapter.
Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to
comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law. The Superintendent may require other Users,
including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits (as necessary) to
carry out the purposes of this chapter.
8-1-34: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING: EXISTING SIU:
Any SIU that was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
Code, and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall submit, within 60
days after notification by the Superintendent a permit application to the City in accordance
with Section 8-1-37 of this chapter. The City's notification to SIU shall comply with the 180-
day submittal deadline date established in 40 CFR Section 403.12(b).
8-1-35: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITTING: NEW SOURCE
AND NEW USER: At least 90 days prior to the anticipated start-up, New Sources, sources
that become a User subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard and New Users which are SIU's, shall apply for a wastewater
discharge permit and will be required to submit to the City at least the information listed in
paragraphs (A)-(E) of Section 8-1-37. A New Source or New User cannot discharge
without first receiving a wastewater discharge permit from the City. New Sources and New
Users shall be required to include in their application information on the method of
pretreatment the User intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New
Sources and New Users shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs
(D) and (E) of Section 8-1-37.

analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass where
required by the City of regulated pollutants contained in Sections 8-
1-9 through 8-1-12, as appropriate in the discharge. Both daily
maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required)
shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall conform to sampling and analytical
procedures outlined in Sections 8-1-47 through 8-1-49.
(c) The User shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this
paragraph.
Title 8-1-29
(d) Where the Superintendent developed alternate concentration or
mass limits because of dilution, this adjusted limit along with
supporting data shall be submitted as part of the application.
(F) Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the User
and certified by a qualified professional as outlined in Section 8-1-38, indicating
whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis,
and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (hereafter referred to as
"O and M") or additional pretreatment is required for the User to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(G) Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment or O and M will be required to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards the User shall submit a Compliance
Schedule indicating the shortest schedule by which the User will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall
not be later than the compliance date established pursuant to Section 8-1-18 of this
Ordinance.
(1) Where the User's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by
removal allowance (40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40
CFR 403.6(e)), or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (40 CFR
493,13) at the time the User submits the report required by this paragraph,
the information required by paragraphs (F) and (G) of this section shall
pertain to the modified limits.
(2) If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance
(40 CFR 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (40 CFR 403.6(e)),
and/or a Fundamentally Different Factors variance (40 CFR 403.13) after the
User submits the report required by paragraphs (F) and (G) of this section
shall be submitted by the User within 60 days after the modified limit is
approved.
(H) Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Superintendent to
evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application.
8-1-38: SIGNATORY AND CERTIFICATION REQUIRED. All
wastewater discharge permit applications and User reports must be signed by an
Authorized Representative of the User and shall contain the following certification
statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared
under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure
that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those
persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted
is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware
Title 8-1-30
that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."
8-1-39: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DECISIONS: The
Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the User and may require additional
information. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete wastewater discharge permit
application, the Superintendent will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater
discharge permit. Upon a determination to issue, the permit shall be issued within thirty
(30) days of full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished. The Superintendent may
deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit if the application fails to conform to
this chapter in any respect.

compliance with this chapter and state and federal laws, rules and
regulations.
Title 8-1-32
8-1-41: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPEALS:
(A) Any person, including the User, may petition the City to reconsider the terms of a
wastewater discharge permit within thirty (30) days of its issuance.
(B) Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the
administrative appeal.
(C) In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater discharge permit
provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and the alternative condition, if
any, it seeks to place in the wastewater discharge permit.
(D) The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be stayed pending
the appeal.
(E) If the City fails to act within thirty (30) days, a request for reconsideration shall be
deemed to be denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit,
not to issue a wastewater discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge
permit, shall be considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial
review.
(F) Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater
discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with a court of competent
jurisdiction within thirty (30) days after the date such decision was signed and
mailed or physically delivered to the User.
8-1-42: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT DURATION:
Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed
five (5) years, at the discretion of the Superintendent. Each wastewater discharge permit
will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
8-1-43: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT MODIFICATION: The
Superintendent may modify the wastewater discharge permit for good cause including, but
not limited to, the following:
(A) To incorporate any new or revised federal, state or local pretreatment standards or
requirements;
(B) To address significant alterations or additions to the User's operation, processes or
wastewater volume or character since the time of wastewater discharge permit
issuance;
(C) A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or
elimination of the authorized discharge;
(D) Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat to the City's
Title 8-1-33
POTW, City personnel or the receiving waters;
(E) Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge permit;
(F) Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater
discharge permit application or in any required reporting;

to 40 CFR 403.13;
(H) To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater discharge permit; or
(I) To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a new owner or
operator.
8-1-44: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT TRANSFER:
Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or transferred to a new owner or
operator only if the permittee gives at least thirty (30) days' advance notice to the
Superintendent and the Superintendent approves the wastewater discharge permit
transfer. The notice to the Superintendent must include a written certification by the new
owner or operator which:
(A) States that the new owner or operator has no immediate intent to change the
facility's operations and processes;
(B) Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
(C) Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater
discharge permit.
If such certification is delivered to the Superintendent and there are no significant changes
to the manufacturing operation or wastewater discharge, the new owner will be considered
an existing User and be covered by the existing limits and requirements in the previous
owner's permit. Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit voidable as of the date of facility transfer.
8-1-45: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REVOCATION:
Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for, but not limited to, the following
reasons:
(A) Failure to notify the Superintendent of significant changes to the wastewater prior to
the changed discharge;
(B) Failure to provide prior notification to the Superintendent of changed conditions;
(C) Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater
Title 8-1-34
discharge permit application;
(D) Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
(E) Tampering with monitoring equipment;
(F) Refusing to allow the City timely access to the facility premises and records;
(G) Failure to meet discharge limitations;
(H) Failure to pay fines;
(I) Failure to pay sewer charges;
(J) Failure to meet compliance schedules;
(K) Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater discharge permit
application;
(L) Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of a permitted facility; or
(M) If the City has to invoke its emergency provision as cited in Section 8-1-61 of this
chapter.
(N) Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any terms of the
wastewater discharge permit or this chapter.
Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations or transfer of
business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a particular User are void
upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit to that User.
8-1-46: WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT REISSUANCE: A
User, required to have a wastewater discharge permit, shall apply for wastewater discharge
permit reissuance by submitting a complete wastewater discharge permit application, in
accordance with Section 8-1-37 of this chapter, a minimum of sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the User's existing wastewater discharge permit. A User, whose existing
wastewater discharge permit has expired and has submitted its re-application in the time
period specified herein, shall be deemed to have an effective wastewater discharge permit
until the City issues or denies the new wastewater discharge permit. A User, whose
existing wastewater discharge permit has expired and who failed to submits its reapplication
in the time period specified herein, will be deemed to be discharging without a
wastewater discharge permit.
8-1-47: SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS FOR USERS:
(A) A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
Title 8-1-35
and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. The Superintendent will determine on a
case-by-case basis whether the User will be able to composite the individual grab
samples. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained
through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The City
may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any User that demonstrates
that flow-proportional is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained
through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of
four (4) grab samples where the User demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
(B) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if
such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated or manufacturing process
if no pretreatment exists or as determined by the City and contained in the User's
wastewater discharge permit. For categorical Users, if other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the User should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the applicable
categorical pretreatment standards. For other SIUs, for which the City has adjusted
its local limits to factor out dilution flows, the User should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with the adjusted pretreatment
standards.
(C) All sample results shall indicate the time, date and place of sampling and methods
of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of
normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges from the User. If a User
samples and analyzes more frequently than what was required in its wastewater
discharge permit, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, it must submit all results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge as part of its self-monitoring report.
8-1-48: ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS: All pollutant analyses,
including sampling techniques, shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in
accordance with procedures approved by the EPA.
8-1-49: MONITORING OF USER'S WASTEWATER: The City may
follow the same procedures as outlined in Sections 8-1-47 and 8-1-48 whenever it deems
City monitoring is appropriate to ensure compliance with this chapter.
8-1-50: INSPECTION AND SAMPLING: The City shall have the right to
enter the facilities of any User to ascertain whether the purposes of this chapter, and any
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, are being met and whether the
User is complying with all requirements thereof. Users shall allow the Superintendent
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties.
Title 8-1-36
(A) Where a User has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the User shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter without delay for the
purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
(B) The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the User's property, or require
installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering of
the User's operations.
(C) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected or sampled shall be promptly removed by the User at the written or verbal
request of the Superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the User.
(D) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the User's premises
shall be a violation of this chapter.
8-1-51: MONITORING FACILITIES:
(A) Each User shall provide and operate at its own expense a monitoring facility to allow
inspection, sampling and flow measurements of each sewer discharge to the City.
Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the User's premises, except where such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the User.
(B) Ample room shall be provided in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate
sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility sampling and
measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the User. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.
(C) The Superintendent may require the User to install monitoring equipment as
necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at
all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at its own expense.
All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
8-1-52: SEARCH WARRANTS: If the Superintendent has been refused
access to a building, structure or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a
need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the City designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then
the Superintendent may seek issuance of a search or seizure warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction. Such warrant shall be served in the manner allowed by law.
Title 8-1-37
8-1-53: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION: Information and data on a
User obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater
discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from City inspection and sampling
activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the User specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and demonstrated
by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be
made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40
CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the
public without restriction.
8-1-54: PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE:
The City shall publish annually, in the Official Newspaper, a list of the
Users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant non-compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance
shall mean:
(A) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which
sixty-six percent (66%) or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six (6)
month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant
parameter by any amount;
(B) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirtythree
percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily
maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria [1.4 for BOD,
TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH];
(C) Any other discharge violation that the City believes has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of City personnel or the general public);
(D) Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public
or to the environment, or has resulted in the City's exercise of its emergency
authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(E) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement
order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final
compliance;
Title 8-1-38
(F) Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports,
including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical
pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules;
(G) Failure to accurately report non-compliance; or
(H) Any other violation(s) which the City determines will adversely affect the operation
or implementation of the local pretreatment program.
8-1-55: NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION: When the Superintendent
finds that a User has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that User a written Notice of
Violation, by certified letter. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the User to the
Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the User of liability for any
violation occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency actions or any
other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
8-1-56: CONSENT ORDERS: The Superintendent may enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any User responsible for non-compliance. Such
documents will include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have
the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Sections 8-1-58
and 8-1-59 of this chapter and shall be judicially enforceable. Use of a Consent Order
shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
8-1-57: SHOW CAUSE HEARING: The Superintendent may order a
User which has violated or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the User specifying the
time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing.
Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User. A show cause
hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
User.
8-1-58: COMPLIANCE ORDERS: When the Superintendent finds that
Title 8-1-39
a User has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the User responsible for the
discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a time specified in the order.
If the User does not come into compliance within the time specified in the order, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain
other requirements to address the non-compliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User.
8-1-59: CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS: When the Superintendent
finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the User to:
(A) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(B) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations or
terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the User.
8-1-60: ADMINISTRATIVE FINES:
(A) When the Superintendent finds that a User has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may fine
such User in an amount not to exceed $100. Such fines shall be assessed on a per
violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term advantage
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
(B) Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after thirty (30) calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of five percent (5%) of the unpaid balance, and
interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per month.
(C) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the
Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within fifteen (15) days of being notified of the fine. Upon receipt of such request,
the Superintendent shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days
thereafter. In the event the User's appeal is successful, the payment, together with
Title 8-1-40
any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the User. The City may add the
costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders,
to the fine.
(D) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the User.
8-1-61: EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS: The Superintendent may
immediately suspend a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or which causes an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a User's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the
environment.
(A) Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or
eliminate its discharge into the POTW. In the event of a User's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Superintendent shall
take steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent shall allow the User to
recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the City that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in Section 8-1-62 of this chapter are initiated against the User.
(B) A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the Superintendent, prior to the date of any show cause or
termination hearing under Sections 8-1-57 and 8-1-62 of this chapter.
Nothing in the section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to an emergency
suspension under this section.
8-1-62: TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE (NON-EMERGENCY): In
addition to the provisions in Section 8-1-45 of this chapter, any User that violates any of the
following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(A) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(B) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;
(C) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume,
constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;
Title 8-1-41
(D) Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring or sampling; or
(E) Violation of the pretreatment standards in Sections 8-1-9 through 8-1-21 this
chapter.
Such User will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under Section 8-1-57 of this chapter why the proposed action
should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the City shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.
8-1-63: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF: When the Superintendent finds that a
User has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the City may petition the Seventh Judicial District of the State of Idaho,
Bingham County through the City Attorney, for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on
activities of the User. The City may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal
or equitable relief, including a requirement for the User to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against a User.
8-1-64: CIVIL PENALTIES:
(A) A User which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of
$1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
(B) The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other
expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the City.
(C) In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all
relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by
the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the
User's violation, corrective actions by the User, the compliance history of the User,
and any other factor as justice requires.
(D) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against a User.
8-1-65: CRIMINAL PROSECUTION:
Title 8-1-42
(A) A User which has willfully or negligently violated any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment
for not more than six (6) months, or both.
(B) A User which has willfully or negligently introduced any substance into the POTW
which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of
a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000 and in addition
thereto, be subject to imprisonment for six (6) months. This penalty shall be in
addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage
available under state law.
(C) A User which knowingly made any false statements, representations, or
certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or
required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder or who falsified, tampered with, or knowingly rendered
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or
imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, or both.
8-1-66: REMEDIES NON-EXCLUSIVE: The provisions in Sections 8-1-
54 through 8-1-72 of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The City may pursue any
one or more of such remedies for any violation of this chapter. Enforcement of
pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement
response plan; however, the City may take other action against any User when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the City may simultaneously take more than one
enforcement action against any non-compliant User.
8-1-67: PERFORMANCE BONDS: The Superintendent may decline to
issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any User which has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue a
wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with any provision of
this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement unless such user first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the City, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
8-1-68: LIABILITY INSURANCE: The Superintendent may decline to
issue or reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any User which has failed to comply with
any provision of this chapter, a previous wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, of any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the User first
submits proof that it has obtained adequate general liability insurance or other similar
financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its
discharge.
Title 8-1-43
8-1-69: TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICES: Whenever a User
has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement,
electric service, water service, or other public utility services to the User may be terminated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8-5-17 of this Code.
8-1-70: PUBLIC NUISANCES: A violation of any provision of this
chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be
corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public
nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code or state law governing such
nuisances, including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing, abating or
remedying said nuisance.
8-1-71: INFORMANT REWARDS: The City may pay a reward of up to
$1,000 for information leading to the discovery of non-compliance by a User. In the event
that the information provided results in an administrative fine or civil penalty levied against
the User, the City may disperse up to ten percent (10%) of the collected fine or penalty to
the informant. However, a single reward payment may not exceed $1,000.
8-1-72: CONTRACTOR LISTING: Users which have not achieved
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the same of goods or services to the City. Existing
contracts for the goods or services to the City held by a User found to be in significant noncompliance
with pretreatment standards or requirements may be terminated at the
discretion of the City.
8-1-73: AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS:
The following affirmative defenses may be established by a User against whom any
enforcement action or remedy is sought.
(A) Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in
which there is unintentional and temporary non-compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of
the User. An upset does not include non-compliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance
with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of
paragraph (3) are met.
(3) A User who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
Title 8-1-44
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
(a) An upset occurred and the User can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
(c) The User has submitted the following information to the POTW and
treatment plant operator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming
aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written
submission must be provided within five (5) days:
(i) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
(ii) The period of non-compliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the non-compliance is
expected to continue; and
(iii) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the non-compliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the User seeking to establish the occurrence
of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of
upset only in an enforcement action brought for non-compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards.
(6) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction,
loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
(B) Prohibited Discharge Standards: A User shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for non-compliance with the prohibitions in
Section 8-1-9 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause
pass through or interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for each pollutant
discharged and the User was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and
during, the pass through or interference; or (b) no local limit exists, but the
discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the User's prior
Title 8-1-45
discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in
the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
(C) Bypass.
(1) For the purposes of this section:
(a) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any
portion of a User's treatment facility.
(b) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence
of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss
caused by delays in production.
(2) A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section.
(3) (a) If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW, at least ten (10) days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
(b) A User shall submit oral notice to the City of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24)
hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the
User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not
been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence
of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-bycase
basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24)
hours.
(4) (a) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action
against a User for a bypass, unless:
(i) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
Title 8-1-46
(ii) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(iii) The User submitted notices as required under paragraph (3) of
this section.
(b) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in paragraph (4)(a) of this section.
8-1-74: SYSTEM OF CHARGES: All charges to Users, within and
without the City, shall assure that each recipient of waste treatment services will pay its fair
share of the costs of operation, maintenance and equipment, including replacement of
waste treatment services provided by the City.
8-1-75: BASIS FOR DETERMINING INDUSTRIAL WASTE CHARGES:
The total yearly treatment plant operation, maintenance and debt service costs chargeable
to each User shall be computed on the basis of the industrial waste load discharged to the
wastewater treatment system.
8-1-76: COMPUTATION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE SERVICE
CHARGE: Industrial waste service charges shall be based upon direct correlation to a
domestic user with flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids
(TSS). Each pollutant shall be considered separately, and the highest number of
equivalent residential dwelling units calculated will be rounded up to the nearest whole
value. (Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
(A) Sampling, testing and monitoring costs incurred by City to verify pollutant
concentrations shall be paid by discharger, in addition to charges outlined above.
(Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-77: METHOD OF COMPUTING UNIT CHARGES:
(A) Unit charges for each Industrial User shall be computed as the product of the flow
and concentration in direct correlation to a domestic user as follows: (Ordinance 579
03/22/16)
IU Flow ERU = User Peak Flow gpd ÷ ERU Peak Flow gpd
IU Flow ERU = User Average Daily Flow gpd ÷ ERU Average Daily Flow gpd
IU Concentration ERU BOD = User BOD concentration ÷ ERU BOD concentration
Title 8-1-47
IU Concentration ERU TSS = User TSS concentration ÷ ERU TSS concentration
The highest calculated value shall be rounded to the nearest whole value and shall
be the calculated ERU.
IU Charge = Greater of (IU Flow ERU Peak or Average Daily) x Greater of (IU
Concentration ERU BOD or TSS) x (single residential dwelling unit charge)
Examples:
IU Flow Peak ERU = 5000 gpd ÷ 320 gpd = 16
IU Flow Average Daily ERU = 3000 gpd ÷ 270 gpd = 11
IU BOD ERU = 12000 mg/l ÷ 350 mg/l = 35
IU TSS ERU = 925 TSS mg/l ÷ 350 mg/l = 3
IU Charge = (Flow 16 ERU’s) x (BOD 35 ERU’s) x (single residential dwelling unit
charge)
IU Charge = (560 ERU’s) x (single residential dwelling unit charge)
(Ordinance 585 09/13/16)
8-1-78: UNIT CHARGES: The ERU’s may be reviewed each January
and adjusted, if necessary. (Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-79: METHOD OF INDUSTRIAL USER BILLING: The Industrial
User service charge shall be based on estimates of flow, BOD and suspended solids for
the previous year. If waste quality and quantity measurements for an Industrial User are
not available or if an Industrial User fails to provide any data as required by this chapter,
the Director shall fairly estimate such charge. In making such estimates the Director shall
rely on such information as he may reasonably determine to be pertinent and reliable.
(Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-80: ADJUSTMENT OF CHARGES: If at any time the actual
discharge of industrial waste by a User is greater or less than the rate factor used for
computing the Industrial User service charge for such User, the User's monthly service
charge may be recomputed in order to more fairly reflect the actual costs of providing
sewage treatment services for such User. (Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-81: SEWER USER SERVICE CHARGE: A monthly service charge
for sewer service shall be charged to all Users. The rates established shall generate
sufficient revenue to offset total costs of the sewerage system which includes: (a) Capital
costs and (b) operation, maintenance and replacement costs. The costs of the sewerage
system shall be reviewed periodically and User rates adjusted, if necessary, to ensure
adequate revenue to cover all costs and to ensure that all Users share equally the cost of
operation, maintenance and replacement. User rates shall be established by resolution of
the City Council and shall be kept on file in the office of the City Clerk.
8-1-82: CLASSIFICATION OF USERS: For billing purposes sewer
Users shall be classified and billed as follows:
Title 8-1-48
(A) Residential.
(B) Industrial.
(Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
All charges established for each classification shall be based upon unit rates for the factor
of flow, BOD and SS. Such unit rates shall be established by resolution of the City Council
from time to time.
8-1-83: DOMESTIC AND COMMERCIALRATES OUTSIDE THE CITY:
All charges for operation and maintenance shall be set by resolution of the City Council
and Mayor for all users whether located within or without the City.
8-1-84: BILLING PERIODS: All regular billing periods shall be on a
monthly basis, and shall include the current applicable charges for debt service,
operations, and maintenance associated with the POTW, as such charges may be
established from time to time by resolution, so long as sewer treatment services are
available to the recipient regardless if such services are actually used. Such charges shall
be included unless and until sewer service is disconnected from the POTW. Any
subsequent reconnection to the POTW shall require payment of all costs and fees as if the
reconnection was a new connection.
8-1-85: BILLING PROCEDURE: Accounts receiving metered water
service shall be charged for sewer service based upon metered water and such charges
may be included in the metered water billing. All other sewer charges may be included with
billings for other City services.
8-1-86: PROPERTY OWNER/LANDLORD RESPONSIBLE FOR
PAYMENT OF SEWER USER FEE: The owner of property to which sewer services are
provided by the City shall be responsible for the payment of the sewer user fee assessed
to that property. Owners of rental properties shall be responsible to pay the sewer user fee
for all rental units. The City staff shall bill the sewer user fee to the property owner for all
rental units where City sewer services are provided. For example, if a property owner owns
a duplex, the property owner shall be billed for the sewer service to both rental units at the
duplex and be responsible to pay the sewer user fee to the City. Likewise, if a property
owner owns an apartment building with twenty (20) units in it to which the City provides
sewer services, then the property owner shall be responsible to pay the City’s sewer user
fee for the twenty (20) units.
8-1-87: DUE DATE: Bills rendered for sewer service are payable upon
receipt and become past due ten (10) days from the date on which rendered. When the
past due date falls on a legal holiday or on a day when City offices are not open for
business, the next regular business day is considered the past due date. When
remittances are made by mail, bills shall be deemed paid on the date of mailing as shown
Title 8-1-49
by the postmark.
8-1-88: DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS: When bills are not paid within
thirty-five (35) days from the past due date, the City may discontinue water or electric utility
service to such delinquent customers in the manner set forth in Section 8-5-17, City Code.
If water or electric service is discontinued for delinquency, it shall not be restored until the
delinquency is paid, or arrangements for payment satisfactory to the City are made,
together with a fee in such amount as the City may determine by resolution from time to
time for discontinuing and restoring service. The fee shall be payable whenever a service
call is made for the purpose of disconnection for nonpayment, even though an actual
disconnect may not occur. In the event the industrial Users fail to have flow or sampling
devices in proper operating condition for more than one week, the Director may discontinue
City water service or remove or close sewer connections, and enter upon the property for
accomplishing such purposes. The expense of such discontinuance, removal or closing,
as well as the expense of restoring service, is a debt due to the City and may be recovered
by legal action against the discharger or by any other remedy or method permitted by this
chapter. (Ordinance 579 03/22/16)
8-1-89: RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED BY THE CITY: Any
discharger who discharges any wastewater in violation of this chapter or who causes
damage to or impairs the City's wastewater disposal system shall be liable to the City for
any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation. The City may bill the discharger
for the reasonable cost incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work
caused by the violation or discharge. Refusal to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a
violation of this chapter.
8-1-90: FALSIFYING INFORMATION: Any person who knowingly
makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report
and plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or
who falsified, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or
method required under this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
8-1-91: LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: Nothing herein is intended to
create any private duty to any customer or discharger or create any private right of action
on account of any failure by the City, or its officers, employees or agents to perform any
duty or obligation set forth herein.

water service or connect a new water service to the existing wells, storage tanks,
pumps, outbuildings and appurtenances of the City water system, all of which were
funded from revenues of the City water system or paid with revenues derived from
ad valorem taxes. The City recognizes the inherent inequity of requiring existing
customers or taxpayers to bear the entire cost of acquiring or building new facilities,
or of utilizing excess capacity with existing facilities, in order to meet the needs of
such new development. The Council hereby finds and recognizes the relationship
between the nature of the uses of property and the impact thereof upon the City
water system. The Council also finds that customers who connect to a water main
located adjacent to their property receive a direct benefit from such water mains,
which benefit is directly proportional to the frontage of the water main along their
property. The Council further finds that it is fair and equitable to charge a main
connection fee for customers who connect to such mains in order to fund a portion
of the cost incurred by the City in installing such mains.
Title 8-4-6
(B) Water System Connection Fees: A water system connection fee shall be collected
from any person requesting connection to the water system for any new building or
structure or for any existing building for which a change in occupancy or use, as
defined under Section 502 of the Uniform Building Code, is made and for which a
new or larger water service line is installed. Such system connection fee shall be as
determined by the City Council by resolution which may be amended and modified
from time to time and which fee schedule in effect shall be maintained by the City
Clerk and available for information to any interested parties upon request.
8-4-15: WATER LINE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND: A Water
System Capital Improvement Fund is hereby established into which all revenues derived
from water connection fees as set forth in this chapter shall be deposited. Expenditures

Chapter when authorized by the City Council.
8-4-16: DISBURSEMENTS OF FUNDS: Disbursements may be made
from the Water System Capital Improvement Fund for the following purposes only:

(C) Payment of principal and interest on any revenue bond or bonds issued by the City
to defray the cost of construction, extension or betterment of the City water or sewer

the customer subject to inspection and approval by the City. The charges for labor and
materials shall be made when such service line is installed by the City before the costs of
such work, and the City Council may adopt a schedule for such charges which shall be
based upon an estimate of actual charges and shall be filed with the City Clerk with the
information thereon to be available to interested parties upon request.
8-4-18: LENGTH OF SERVICE: Where a water main is located in a
public right of way, the maximum length of service line furnished and installed by the City
for the standard installation fee set forth above shall be fifty feet (50'). Where the main is
on private property, the maximum length of service line furnished and installed by the City
for the standard installation fee shall be thirty feet (30'). If the length of the service line
exceeds the maximums stated above, an additional charge shall be made, based on the
actual cost to the City to furnish and install the extra pipe.

for a different arrangement is first authorized in writing by the Water Department.
8-4-21: BRANCH SERVICE: No service connection serving more than
one customer shall be made. Where an existing water service provides service to several
customers, the City may terminate water service until a separate service is provided at the

also obtain a permit under Chapter 7 of this title.
8-4-25: SERVICE CALL CHARGE: The City may assess and collect a
service charge, in an amount not to exceed the actual cost to the City, for service calls
which are requested on Saturday or a legal holiday or during a time other than normal

are necessitated because of plumbing which does not meet the requirements of the
Uniform Plumbing Code.

adjust or tamper with any portion of the City Water System or appurtenances, whether
located upon public or private property, without having first obtained the express permission
of the City. If any person damages the water system or in any way causes the City to
expend extraordinary costs as a result of such unlawful acts, the City may assess and
collect the same from the person committing the same, or from the parent or guardian of
any minor who commits such acts. Such amounts may be included upon the customer's

monthly basis, but premises occupied less than one month shall be charged only for that
occupied portion.
8-4-32: BILLING PROCEDURES: Metered accounts shall receive a

service but no electric service shall receive separate billing. Nonmetered accounts shall be
charged a flat rate in accordance with the rate schedule found in Section 8-4-36 of this
chapter.
8-4-33: DUE DATE: Bills rendered for water service are payable upon
receipt and become past due ten (10) days from the date on which rendered. When the
past due date falls on a Saturday or a legal holiday or on a day when City offices are not

determine the cost for the installation of such service, taking into consideration the length
and size of pipe, condition of street and sidewalk, all relative to the character of service,
and such cost shall be paid by the applicant before such installation is made. No customer
receiving metered water service shall use a fire service connection for domestic purposes
or any purpose other than for fire protection. If the water superintendent finds a fire
connection is being used for any purpose other than for fire protection upon the premises,
the owner or occupant shall be notified and if such improper conditions are not corrected
within ten (10) days, water service to the entire premises may be shut off until proper
adjustments are made.

sanitation, peace and public welfare that proper and adequate regulations be adopted to
require property owners and occupants to secure containers and receptacles of sufficient
kind and size in which to deposit waste, refuse, trash, garbage and rubbish for collection

CHAPTER 5
ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS
10-5-1 Intent
10-5-2 Zoning Districts
10-5-1: INTENT: The following zoning districts are hereby established.
For the interpretation of this Ordinance, the zoning districts have been formulated to realize
the general purpose as set forth in this Ordinance and to conform with the Plan and its
stated goals and objectives. In addition, the specific purpose of each zoning district shall
be as stated.
10-5-2: ZONING DISTRICTS:
(A) Agricultural District (A)--The purpose of the A District is to permit current agricultural,
large-lot rural residential and other types of open land uses to be maintained, and to
protect agricultural land from spasmodic, disorderly and indiscriminate development.
This district is also established to control the infiltration of urban-type development,
which could adversely affect agricultural operations, until such time as property
owners desire such development.
(B) Residential/Agricultural District (R/A)--The purpose of the R/A District is to create,
protect and maintain a living environment composed of single family, detached
dwellings on one acre or larger lots in areas now so developed and adjacent vacant
areas likely to be so developed. The essential characteristic of the R/A district is
rural, with lot sizes sufficient for individual water and sewer facilities; however,
centralized water and sewer facilities are encouraged. Consideration must be given
in this district to the efficient and economical extension of City services, particularly
into those areas near or adjacent to City boundaries.
(C) Single Family Residence District (R1)--The purpose of the R1 District is to provide a
residential environment which is characterized by smaller lot sizes and somewhat
higher density than that of the R/A District. This district is also characterized by
yards and other amenities necessary to maintain quality single-family residential
living. Homes in this district should be connected to City service; and curbs, gutters
and paved streets are desirable.
(D) Two-Family Dwelling District (R2)--The purpose of the R2 District is to protect quiet,
residential areas, now developed or developing, while at the same time allowing a
limited increase in population density. This district is characterized by smaller
Title 10-5-2
dwellings, somewhat more compact and denser residential development and a
higher volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic than are present in the R/A and R1
Districts.
(E) Multiple Residence District (RM)--The purpose of the RM District is to establish
areas permitting a greater population density than is allowed in more restrictive
districts while at the same time maintaining a residential environment consistent with
such greater population density. In general, this district is located nearer the central
part of the City, in areas where such use has been established and along major
arteries on the borders of neighborhoods.
(F) Resident/Office District (RO)--The purpose of the RO District is to create an area of
higher density multi-family dwellings close to the City center and to create areas with
easy access from residential areas for the location of professional offices. The
inclusion of professional offices within this district encourages the utilization of
existing structures which will help to retain the residential character of an area while
at the same time creating a transition between the Central Business District and
lower density residential areas.
(G) Central Business District (CB)--The purpose of the CB District is to accommodate
and encourage further expansion and renewal of the historic business-core area of
the City. A variety of business, public, quasi-public, cultural, residential and other
related uses are encouraged in an effort to provide the mix of activities necessary to
establish a vital downtown area. This district provides for the location and grouping
of compatible uses having common performance standards. It should be
characterized by clean and well-lighted streets, ample pedestrian ways and
convenient vehicular parking.
(H) Heavy Commercial District (HC)--The purpose of the HC District is to provide for the
location and development of businesses and service establishments which are
incompatible with the CB District in that they involve enterprises which depend
primarily on motorized vehicular traffic and require outside activities, relatively large
lot sizes and easy highway access. These districts are normally located along
highways leading into the City and are characterized by buildings set well back from
the right-of-way.
(I) Manufacturing District (M)--The purpose of the M District is to encourage
manufacturing and wholesaling activities in an area which will impact as little as
possible on the other districts within the City. As this type of enterprise normally
needs heavy truck or railroad access, it is normally located along highways leading
into the City or along railways. This district should be kept free from residential and
retail commercial activities.

10-11-1: INTENT: It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit nonconforming
uses to continue until they are removed, discontinued, or abandoned, but not to
encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that non-conforming uses
shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding
other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
10-11-2: INCOMPATIBILITY OF NON-CONFORMING USES: Nonconforming
uses are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in
the district in which such use is located. A non-conforming use may be extended or
enlarged after passage of this Ordinance only if thereafter the entire structure is devoted to
a conforming use.
10-11-3: AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP: To avoid undue
hardship, nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any building or land which was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance.
10-11-4: (Rescinded by Ordinance 547 June 26, 2012)
10-11-5: NON-CONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF
STRUCTURES AND LAND: If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure
and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Ordinance that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this Ordinance, the
use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following
provisions:
(A) No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Ordinance in the district
in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved
Title 10-11-2
or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted
in the district in which it is located;
(B) No non-conforming use of land, structure or combination of land and structure shall
be extended to occupy any additional area;
(C) If no structural alterations are made, any non-conforming use of a structure or
structure and land may, upon the issuance of a Special Use Permit by the
Commission, be changed to another non-conforming use provided the Commission
shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing non-conforming use. In permitting such change, the
Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
other provisions of this Ordinance;
(D) Any structure or structure and land in combination in or on which a non-conforming
use is followed by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the
district and the non-conforming use may not thereafter be resumed;
(E) Except as otherwise governed by Idaho Code Section 67-6538 when a nonconforming
use of a structure, or of land, or of a structure and land in combination is
discontinued or abandoned for more than one (1) year (except when government
action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or land, or the structure and
land in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located; and
(F) When a change of ownership of property takes place upon property which enjoys
the grandfather provisions of this Chapter, the change of ownership shall constitute
a discontinued use of the non-conforming use and upon the change of ownership
the non-conforming use will no longer be allowed pursuant to this Chapter.
10-11-6: REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE: Nothing in this chapter shall
be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or
part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety.
10-11-7: USES UNDER SPECIAL USE PROVISIONS NOT
NON-CONFORMING USES: Any use which is permitted as a special use in a district
under the provisions of this Ordinance shall not be deemed a non-conforming use in such
district; but shall, without further action, be considered a conforming use.
10-11-8: EXCEPTION TO NON-CONFORMING USE PROVISIONS:
The Commission may recommend to the Council exceptions to non-conforming use
provisions upon a finding that unnecessary and extraordinary hardship will likely result from
strict compliance with the non-conforming use provisions of this chapter.
Regardless whether the Commission recommends granting an exception or denying an
Title 10-11-3
exception, the Commission shall deliver its recommendation, including its reasoning and
findings, to the Council. After receiving the Commission’s recommendation, the Council
shall set and conduct a hearing at the next regularly scheduled Council meeting to
determine whether to allow the exception. The Council may permit the exception to the
non-conforming use provisions of this chapter upon a finding that unnecessary and
extraordinary hardship will likely result from strict compliance with the non-conforming use
provisions of this chapter.
At all time, both before the Commission and the Council, the presumption shall be against
the continuation of the non-conforming use and the applicant shall bear the burden of
showing by clear and convincing evidence that such exception to the non-conforming use
provisions should be allowed.

special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. Existing non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings n the same district and existing permitted or non-conforming use of lands,
structures or buildings in other districts shall not be grounds for issuance of a variance.
Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of convenience or profit, but only where
strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.

10-15-1: PURPOSE: It shall be the City's policy to guide major
developments of land and the related construction by encouraging Planned Unit
Developments (PUDs) to achieve the following:
(A) A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing and
building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a reduction in lot
dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
(B) A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if permitted as a part
of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory uses;
(C) A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and
geological features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents the
disruption of natural drainage patterns;
(D) A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through conventional
Title 10-15-2
development resulting in substantial savings through shorter utility lines and streets;
and
(E) A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation and
community design objectives of the Plan.
10-15-2: PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT
DEVELOPMENTS: Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of
this chapter and those of other chapters of this Ordinance, the provisions of this Chapter
shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed by the respective
provisions found elsewhere in this Ordinance.
10-15-3: MINIMUM AREA: A PUD for the following principal uses shall
contain an area of not less than:
(A) Three (3) acres for residential development;
(B) Five (5) acres for residential use with subordinate commercial or industrial uses;
(C) Ten (10) acres for commercial use;
(D) Ten (10) acres for industrial use; and
(E) Fifteen (15) acres for recreational use.
10-15-4: USES PERMITTED: All uses that may be allowed within the
land use district are permitted within a PUD. Also, up to ten (10) percent of the gross land
may be directed to other commercial, industrial, public and semi-public uses that are not
allowed within the land use district, provided there is a favorable finding by the Commission
that:
(A) The uses are appropriate with the residential uses;
(B) The uses are intended to serve principally the residents of the PUD;
(C) The uses are planned as an integral part of the PUD; and
(D) The uses are located and so designed as to provide direct access to a collector or
an arterial street without creating congestion or traffic hazards.
10-15-5: OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT: An application for approval of a
PUD may be filed by a property owner or his agent. The PUD application shall be filed in
the name(s) of the recorded owner(s) of the property included in the development;
however, the application may be filed by the holder(s) of an equitable interest in such
property.
Title 10-15-3
10-15-6: COMMON OPEN SPACE: A minimum of ten (10) percent of
the gross land area developed in any residential PUD project shall be reserved for common
open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being
developed.
The required amount of common space reserved under a PUD
shall be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project for the use of each owner
who buys property within the development, or shall be sold to the owners of the project as a
group or be dedicated to the public and retained as common space for parks, recreation or
related uses. Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way for water courses and
other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication unless such
land or right-of-way is usable and is approved by the Commission
The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall
be specified by the developer before approval of the Final Development Plan.
Every property developed under the PUD should be designed to
abut common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged.
10-15-7: UTILITY REQUIREMENT: Underground utilities, including
telephone and electrical systems, are required within the limits of all PUDs. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement
if the Commission finds that such exception will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed PUD.
10-15-8: INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY: To provide an incentive
for a quality PUD, the Commission may authorize an increased residential density.
Character, identity and architectural and siting variations incorporated in a development
shall be considered cause for density increases, provided these factors make a substantial
contribution to the objectives of the PUD.
Additional residential density may also be authorized for the
following specific factors:
(A) Landscaping--streetscapes, open spaces and plazas, use of existing landscaping,
pedestrianway treatments and recreational areas;
(B) Siting--visual focal points, use of existing physical features such as topography,
view, sun and wind orientation, circulation pattern, physical environment, variation in
building setbacks and building grouping, i.e., clustering; and
(C) Design features--street sections, architectural styles, harmonious use of materials,
parking areas broken by landscaping features and varied use of housing types.
Title 10-15-4
10-15-9: ARRANGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL USES: When PUDs
include commercial uses, commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as
groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections. Plant screens or fences
shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas abutting residential uses.
The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings and for adequate and properly arranged facilities for
internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other features and facilities as may be
necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining
and surrounding non-commercial areas.
All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner.
10-15-10: ARRANGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL USES: PUDs may include
industrial uses if it can be shown that the development results in a more efficient and
desirable use of land.
Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in park__like
surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen lighting,
parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw materials or products.
A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony of buildings and a compact
grouping in order to economize in the provision of such utility services as are required.
Thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum throughout a planned industrial area in order to
reduce through traffic.
Project side yards of forty (40) feet and a rear yard of fifty (50)
feet shall be required if the project is located adjacent to any residential uses. All
intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and improved areas shall be
landscaped with trees and plantings and shall be properly maintained.
10-15-11: ARRANGEMENT OF RECREATIONAL USES: PUDs which are
primarily recreational in nature shall be developed utilizing natural surroundings and

Land which the Council determines to be unsuitable for
subdivision because of periodic flooding, poor drainage, excessively steep slopes or other
features likely to be harmful to the safety and general health and welfare of present or
future residents shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods are utilized to overcome
adverse conditions.
In order to ensure the reasonable and beneficial development of
land within the City, and in those additional areas defined in 10-16-2, the following
standards shall be observed:
(A) Streets--The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall be in relation to existing streets, to topographic conditions, to public
convenience and safety and to the proposed uses of land to be served by such
streets. Additionally:
(1) Local and minor residential streets shall be designed to discourage their use
by through traffic. Reserve strips controlling access to public streets may be
permitted;
(2) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing arterial street, railroad or
Title 10-16-4
limited access highway, the appropriate use of the tract may require frontage
roads or such other treatment as may be necessary to adequately protect
residential properties and afford separation of through and local traffic;
(3) Half street dedications shall be discouraged; however, a partial street
dedication may be allowed when:
(a) Such street forms the boundary of the proposed subdivision;
(b) Such street is deemed to be necessary for the orderly development of
the neighborhood; and
(c) It will be appropriate to require the dedication of the remainder of the
right-of-way when the adjoining property is developed;
(4) Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a
subdivision shall be such that some streets shall extend to the boundary line
of the tract (stub streets) to provide for the future extension of said streets
into adjacent areas. A reserve strip may be required and held in public
ownership;
(5) Street width shall be measured from property line to property line. The
minimum width of streets so measured shall be:
(1) Arterial..........................................................80 feet
(2) Collector........................................................62 feet
(3) Minor/Local....................................................62 feet
In addition to the above, no street in the City of Shelley shall be less than 40
feet in width from one edge of the pavement to the other. In other words,
measuring from the center of the pavement to the edge of the pavement can
be no less than 20 feet on each side for a total of not less than 40 feet from
one edge of the pavement to the other edge of the pavement.
(6) Cul-de-sac and dead-end street shall not be more than four hundred (400)
feet in length and shall terminate with an adequate turnaround having a
minimum radius of fifty (50) feet for right-of-way;
(7) Minimum street grades of four-tenths percent (0.4%) will be required with the
maximum grade being six percent (6%) for arterial streets and ten
percent (10%) for local streets. Before an exception to this standard may be
granted, specifications shall be reviewed by the City Engineer;
(8) When street lines within a block deflect from each other at any one (1) point
more than ten (10) degrees, there shall be a connecting curve. The radius of
the curve for the inner street line shall not be less than five hundred (500)
feet for an arterial, three hundred (300) feet for a collector and one hundred
Title 10-16-5
fifty (150) feet for a minor/local street;
(9) Private streets are prohibited; and
(10) Street name signs shall be erected by the subdivider in accordance with City
specifications.
(11) Street construction shall comply with and meet the standards set by the
City’s current engineers or prior resolution of the city council incorporating
standards previously set by the City’s engineers.

and parking;
(3) Where alleys are not provided, easements of not less than eight (8) feet in
width shall be dedicated on each side of all real lot lines, and six (6) feet on
side lot lines, where necessary for poles, wires, conduits, storm and sanitary
sewers, gas and water lines. Easements of greater width may be required
along lines across lots or along boundaries where necessary for surface
drainage or for the extension of main sewer or water lines or other utilities;
(4) Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but,
where necessary, such corners shall be rounded sufficiently to permit safe

vehicles to be visible to the driver of another vehicle when each is one
hundred (100) feet from the center of the intersection;
(3) No more than two (2) streets shall cross at any one (1) intersection;
(4) "T" intersections may be used whenever such design will not restrict the free
movement of traffic. In such cases, parallel street centerlines shall be offset
Title 10-16-6
by a distance of at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet; and
(5) Curbs at street intersections shall be rounded with curves having a minimum
radius of twenty-five (25) feet.
(D) Pedestrian Walkways--
(1) Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width and may be required to
be wider in areas near shopping centers, schools or where pedestrian traffic
may warrant a greater width; and
(2) Right-of-way for pedestrian walkways in the middle of long blocks may be
required where necessary to obtain convenient pedestrian circulation to
schools, parks or shopping areas. The pedestrian easement shall be at least
ten (1) feet wide.
(E) Lot Requirements--
(1) Lot width, depth, total area and minimum setback lines shall comply with
provisions of 8.0 of this Ordinance;
(2) Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines
except where other treatment can be demonstrated to provide a better street
and lot plan;
(3) Every lot shall have access to a public street;
(4) Where parcels of land are subdivided into lots of one acre or larger, the
parcels shall be divided, where feasible, so as to allow for future
re-subdividing into smaller parcels and lot arrangement shall allow for the
ultimate extension of adjacent streets through the center of large blocks.
Whenever such future subdividing, or lot-splitting, is contemplated, the plan
therefor shall be approved by the Commission prior to such action; and
(5) Where individual septic tanks and/or water systems are to be installed
pursuant to waiver of the City, the Guidelines on Subdivisions of the Health
Authority shall be followed.
(F) Planting Strips--Planting strips shall be required to be placed next to incompatible
features such as highways, railroads, commercial or industrial uses to screen the

10-19-5 Failure to Number
10-19-1: SUPERVISION OF STREET NUMBERING: The Planning and
Building Division shall supervise the numbering of all houses and buildings upon the streets
and avenues within the City.
10-19-2: BASELINE NUMBERING SYSTEMS:
(A) Baseline Systems. All residences and businesses within the City shall be numbered
in accordance with the street numbering system set forth in this chapter. All
buildings within the City shall be numbered in accordance with a baseline system,
which shall have a north-south baseline and an east-west baseline. The intersection
of such baselines shall hereafter be referred to as the Initial Point.
(B) Initial Point and Baseline. The Initial Point for the City shall be the junction of the
centerline of Center Street and the center line of Park Avenue. The north-south
baseline shall run along the centerline of Center Street and the east-west baseline
shall run along the centerline of Park Avenue.
10-19-3: METHOD OF NUMBERING:
(A) Numbering of Streets Generally. Numbering shall commence at the Initial Point. All
blocks shall be numbered with fifty (50) numbers to a side between two intersecting
streets, except where such numbering would produce irregularity. Numbering shall
extend all directions from the Initial Point with the even numbers being on the right,
and the odd numbers on the left, when facing away from the Initial Point. Houses
and buildings located on streets not extending to a baseline shall be numbered as
though such street extended to a baseline. All numbers for buildings and houses
located on a street shall be approximately evenly proportioned for the 50 numbers
located between the two streets intersecting perpendicularly thereto. All building
numbers shall conform as nearly as possible to the corresponding points on parallel
or nearly parallel streets.
Title 10-19-2
(B) Dual Direction Streets. If a street changes from running approximately parallel to
one baseline to another perpendicular baseline, then the numbering shall change at
the center of the curve in the street where such change is made, except as set forth
below. If a street changes direction and then reverts to running parallel with its
original direction without intersection with another street, then all houses and
buildings located thereon shall be numbered as though the entire street ran in the
same direction for the entire length thereof. In such case, all houses and buildings
located thereon shall be numbered in even proportions for the 50 numbers on each
side thereof.
(C) Dual Occupancies. Buildings having more than one occupancy shall have separate
numbers at the street entrance to each occupancy.
10-19-4: DISPLAYING NUMBERS: The owner of each house or building
within the City shall display thereon its correct street number as determined by the
numbering system prescribed in this chapter. The numbers shall be not less than three
inches (3") in height, shall be placed as near the street entrance as is practicable and shall
be clearly readable from the street in daylight.
10-19-5: FAILURE TO NUMBER: Any owner of any house or building
within the City who fails to display the correct street number of such house or building in the
manner prescribed herein or displays any incorrect street number thereof is guilty of a
misdemeanor.

WATER RIGHTS
10-20-1 Intent
10-20-2 Assignment of Water Rights by Developer
10-20-3 Use of Water
10-20-4 Use of Water by City Residents
10-20-5 Punishment for Violation
10-20-1: INTENT: The City of Shelley recognizes the need to conserve
water and its application for beneficial use. This chapter of the City Code is established to
ensure a sufficient water supply for the City’s needs and to promote the efficient and
beneficial use of water within the City of Shelley.
10-20-2: ASSIGNMENT OF WATER RIGHTS BY DEVELOPER: Any
person or entity who develops a subdivision, planned unit development, mobile home park,
or other regulated development within the City of Shelley shall transfer its water rights to
the City of Shelley as a part of the development process. It is anticipated that upon the City
providing City water to a development, that the surface water rights or ground water rights
to that property will be transferred to the City of Shelley for use by the City.
10-20-3: USE OF WATER: The City and developers shall mutually agree
upon a water use plan within a development. This will include, but not be limited to, a plan
for how culinary water will be provided to the project, how irrigation water will be provided to
and used by the development, how water will be used for aesthetic purposes within the
development, and any other uses of water within the development. The City and developer
will have flexibility to determine the highest and best use of water within a development.
For example, if a developer has irrigation water rights to the land that is to be developed
and those irrigation water rights will be unused within the development, then the developer
will be expected to transfer those irrigation water rights to the City of Shelley to be added to
the City’s overall water rights and for future use and application by the City. The City in
turn would then anticipate providing culinary water to the developer with the normal fees,
costs, hookup fees, and other expenses of providing water to the development to be paid
by the developer. (The transfer of water rights by the developer to the City shall not excuse
the developer from paying the normal charges and expenses for use of the City’s water
system. However, as a part of the trade of the water rights, the City may negotiate its users
fees with a developer at the discretion of the city council.)
10-20-4: USE OF WATER BY CITY RESIDENTS: The City retains the
right to direct the allocation and use of City water by City residents. For example, the City
shall have the right to direct the allocation of City water for both culinary and irrigation
purposes. The City shall have the right to direct the date, times, and use of City water as
may be necessary to prudently allocate the City’s water.
10-20-5: PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATION: Any violation of the provisions
of Title 10, Chapter 20, shall be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine of up to
$1,000.00 and imprisonment of up to six (6) months in jail.

10-21- 1 Statutory Authority; Purpose and Intent
10-21- 2 Definitions
10-21- 3 Regulations
Chapter 21 Section 1: STATUTORY AUTHORITY; PURPOSE AND
INTENT: In order to balance the need for clean, renewable energy resources and
the necessity to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community,
the City of Shelley finds these regulations are necessary to ensure that wind
energy conversion systems are appropriately designed and safely sited and
installed.
This ordinance establishes the regulations and criteria which allow windmills to
be located within the various land use districts. Unless otherwise provided, all
windmill uses are subject to the same regulations as the sponsoring primary use.
Chapter 21 Section 2: DEFINITIONS:
RESIDENTIAL WIND
ENERGY SYSTEM: A wind energy conversion system consisting of a
wind turbine, tower, and associated control or
conversion electronics, which has a rated capacity
of not more than 10 KW and which is intended to
primarily reduce on-site consumption of utility
power. A system is considered a residential wind
energy system only if it supplies electrical power
solely for on-site use, except that when a parcel on
which the system is installed also receives electrical
power supplied by a utility company, excess
electrical power generated and not presently needed
for on-site use may be used by the utility company.
TOWER: The vertical component of a wind energy
conversion system that elevates the wind turbine
generator and attached blades above the ground.
Chapter 21 Section 3: REGULATIONS:
Residential wind energy systems shall be a permitted use in all zoning where
structures of any sort are allowed; subject to certain requirements as set forth
below:
(A) Tower Height: For property sizes at least one third (1/3) acre up to one acre,
the tower height shall be limited to no less than 30 feet and no greater than 70 feet
measured from the ground to the highest point of the turbine blades. For property
sizes of one acre or more, there is no limitation on tower height, except as
imposed by FAA or other applicable regulations. Wind energy conversion
systems shall not be subject to the height regulation for buildings set forth in
Section 10-8-1 of the City Code as such may be amended from time to time.
(B) Clearance of Blade: No portion of the turbine or blades, or any other moving
parts of the residential wind energy system shall extend within twenty (20) feet of
the ground. No blades may extend over parking areas, driveways, sidewalks, or
exposed utility lines.
(C) Set-back: No part of the wind system structure, including guy wire anchors,
may be located within ten (10) feet of the property boundaries of the installation
site. Set-back for the system tower from the property boundaries shall be at least
equal to the actual Tower Height as installed, provided that the location also
complies with any other applicable setback requirements.
(D) Automatic Over Speed Controls: All wind energy conversion systems shall
be equipped with manual (electronic or mechanical) and automatic over speed
controls to limit the blade rotation speed to within the design limits of the
residential wind energy system.
(E) Sound: Residential wind energy systems shall not exceed 60 DBA, as
measured at the closest neighboring inhabited dwelling. The level, however, may
be exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages and/or severe wind
storms.
(F) Approved Wind Turbines: Residential wind turbines must be approved under
an Emerging Technology program such as the California Energy Commission,
IEC or any other small wind certifications program recognized by the American
Wind Energy Associations (AWEA) or the U.S. Department of Energy. Noncertified
residential wind turbines must submit a description of the safety features
of the turbine prepared by a registered mechanical engineer. Non-certified
residential wind turbines must also be reviewed and approved by the City’s
engineer.
(G) Compliance with International Uniform Building Code: Building permit
applications for residential wind systems shall be accompanied by standard
drawings of the wind turbine structure, including the tower, base and footings.
An engineering analysis of the tower showing compliance with the International
Uniform Building Code and certified by a licensed professional engineer shall
also be submitted. This analysis is frequently supplied by the manufacturer. Wet
stamps shall not be required.
(H) Compliance with FAA Regulations: Residential wind energy systems must
comply with applicable FAA regulations, including any necessary approvals for
installations close to airports.
(I) Compliance with National Electric Code: Building permit applications for
residential wind energy systems shall be accompanied by a line drawing of the
electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a determination that the
manner of the installation conforms to the National Electrical Code. This
information is frequently supplied by the manufacturer.
(J) Utility Notification: No residential wind energy system shall be installed until
evidence has been given that the utility company has been informed of the
customer’s intent to install an interconnected customer-owned generator. Off-grid
systems shall be exempt from this requirement.

city's impact area, at owners expense, shall install all street side improvements,
including sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, and said sidewalks shall be a minimum of 5
feet in width and may be required to be wider in areas near shopping centers, schools,
or where pedestrian traffic may warrant a greater width and such improvements shall
be installed under the supervision of the city engineer to the minimum relevant
specifications. However, in areas where the grade for street side improvements has
not yet been established or in areas where there is not an abutting sidewalk on either
side of the new construction, then the city council may, by majority vote, waive the
requirement for the installation of street side improvements in such areas. At such
time as there is a grade established or an abutting sidewalk on either side of the
property, the owner shall property then be required to install all street side
