LODI, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Lodi, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 21, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Lodi, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1985, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Ms. Alice Reimche, city clerk. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 21, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1960, passed November 7, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 21, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 21, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 21, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Chapter 1.10 - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS

Article I. - Code EnforcementAdministrative Provisions 
 
1.10.010 - Declaration of purpose. 
A.  The city council finds that the enforcement of the Lodi Municipal Code and applicable state codes throughout the city is an important public service. Code enforcement is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety, and quality of life. The city council recognizes that enforcement starts with the drafting of precise regulations that can be effectively applied in administrative enforcement hearings and judicial proceedings. After consideration of the recommendations of the community improvement division, the city council further finds that a comprehensive code enforcement system requires a variety of judicial remedies and administrative remedies to enforce violations of this code and applicable state codes. The city council also finds that there is a need to establish uniform procedures for administrative enforcement hearings conducted pursuant to this code. It is the purpose and intent of the city council to afford due process of law to any person who is directly affected by an administrative action. Due process of law includes: adequate notice, an opportunity to participate in the administrative hearing process and an adequate explanation of the reasons justifying the administrative action. These procedures are also intended to establish a forum to efficiently, expeditiously, and fairly resolve issues raised in any administrative enforcement action. The city attorney is authorized to develop policies and procedures relating to the qualifications, appointment, and compensation of hearing officers, hearing officer powers, hearing procedures, scope of the hearing, subpoena powers, and other matters relating to administrative enforcement hearings.

These may include the taking of photographs, samples, or other physical evidence such as the use of a sound level measurement device to measure noise disturbances. All inspections, entries, examinations, and surveys shall be done in a reasonable manner. If an owner, occupant, or agent or other responsible person refuses permission to enter or inspect, the community improvement officer may seek an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to the procedures provided for in the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
(Ord. 1777 § 1 (part), 2006)  
1.10.050 - Code enforcement feesPurpose. 
A.  The city council finds there is a need to recover costs incurred by the city in its code enforcement efforts including time spent by city personnel inspecting and reinspecting properties throughout the city, preparing and posting the various notices that are required under this code whenever a property is found to be in violation of a mandatory provision, processing a case file, towing inoperative vehicles, obtaining inspection warrants, and preparing for and appearing at administrative hearings, which procedures all become necessary when a responsible person fails to voluntarily correct code violations on his or her property. These additional code enforcement efforts are not usually undertaken or employed until after a responsible person has failed to respond on a voluntary basis to notices and/or warnings from the city or volunteers. 
B.  The city council further finds the assessment of fees for the services listed in subsection A of this section, are an appropriate method to recover costs incurred for the additional work that is undertaken by city staff when a responsible person fails to voluntarily correct code violations on his or her property in a timely manner. The assessment and collection of these code enforcement fees shall not preclude the imposition of, and shall be in addition to, any administrative or judicial civil penalties or fines for violations of this code or applicable state codes.

(Ord. 1777 § 1 (part), 2006)  
1.10.090 - Notification of assessment of reinspection fees.

1.10.100 - Collection of reinspection fee. 
The city shall collect the assessed code enforcement and late fees by the use of all appropriate legal means, including but not limited to: referral to the finance department for collection or assessment against the property.

(Prior code § 23-10)  
3.12.020 - Hotel registration. 
Within thirty days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

 This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of Chapter 3.12 of the Lodi Municipal Code by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting such tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit. 
(Prior code § 23-12)  
3.12.030 - Imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of six percent of the rent charged by the operator.

The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 23-13)  
3.12.040 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to the rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, established to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Prior code § 23-15)  
3.12.050 - Collection by operators. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient.

No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 23-17)  
3.12.070 - Failure to report or remit. 
A.  If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. 
B.  As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. 
C.  Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. 
D.  At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.12.100.

C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid under this chapter. 
(Prior code § 23-19)

It is the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 23-21)  
3.12.110 - Collection action.

If the seller does not present a receipt tax clearance certificate within thirty days after such successor commences to conduct business, the successor shall deposit the withheld amount with the tax administrator pending settlement of the account of the seller.

In the event grantee, after written notice, fails or refuses to act, the city shall have the power to remove or abate the same at the expense of the grantee, all without compensation or liability for damages to grantee.

In the event that the grantee or its employee determines that grantee's cable system is not responsible for any given problem which has resulted in a service call (i.e., subscriber equipment is at fault), the subscriber shall have the right to have this contention demonstrated through the use of an additional television receiver comparison. A standard television receiver will be used in the subscriber's home to allow a direct A/B comparison of performance.

When there have been similar complaints made or when there exists other evidence, which, in the judgment of the city manager casts doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the city manager shall have the right and authority to compel a grantee to test, analyze, and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be delivered to the city manager no later than fourteen days after the city manager formally notifies the grantee and shall include the following information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests; what system components were tested, the equipment used, and procedures employed in said testing; the results of such tests; and the method in which said complaints were resolved.

The aforesaid engineer should sign all records of the special tests and forward to the city manager such records with a report interpreting the results of the tests and recommending actions to be taken by a grantee and the city. 
H.  The city's right under this section shall be limited to requiring tests, analyses, and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on said complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances as the city has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence requires that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service. 
I.  The city manager is authorized and empowered to adjust, settle or compromise any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any grantee under this chapter, either on behalf of the city, the grantee or any subscriber in the best interest of the public.

A.  Failure to complete system construction or reconstruction in accordance with Sections 5.16.170 and 5.16.430 unless the council specifically approves the delay by motion or resolution, due to the occurrence of conditions beyond grantee's control, a grantee shall pay five hundred dollars per day for each day or part thereof, the deficiency continues.

E.  Failure to do any of the requirements of subsections A, B, C and D of this section within the time specified except as provided in subsection F of this section shall be grounds for termination of the franchise. 
F.  The council may in its discretion extend the time for the grantee, acting in good faith, to do any act required under this section. The time for commencement of construction and installation, or the rendering of service to subscribers, initially or thereafter, shall be extended or excused, as the case may be, for any period during which the grantee experiences delay or interruptions due to any of the following circumstances if reasonably beyond its control: necessary utility changes or rearrangements, governmental or regulatory restrictions or requirements, labor strikes, lockouts, war (declared or undeclared), national emergency, fire, earthquake, the elements and acts of God.

5.16.180 - Forfeiture and termination. 
A.

4.  Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or negotiation of the franchise. 
B.  The foregoing shall not constitute a material breach if the violation occurs but it is without fault of a grantee or occurs as a result of circumstances beyond its control. Grantee shall not be excused by mere economic hardship nor by misfeasance or malfeasance of its shareholders, directors, officers, or employees. 
C.  The city may make a written demand that a grantee comply with any such provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to this chapter and franchise agreement. If the violation by the grantee continues for a period of thirty days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city may place the issue of termination of a franchise before the city council. The city shall cause to be served upon grantee at least twenty days prior to the date of such a council meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and issue which the council is to consider.

F.  The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The council then may terminate a franchise forthwith upon finding that grantee has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period in its discretion. 
(Ord. 1370 § 1 (part), 1985)  
5.16.190 - Security fund. 
A.  Within thirty days after the award or renewal of a franchise, a grantee shall deposit with the city a corporate surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand dollars. The bond shall be used to insure the faithful performance by a grantee of all provisions of this chapter and resulting franchise agreement; and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the city having jurisdiction over its acts or default under a franchise and the payment by the grantee of any penalties, liquidated damages, claims, liens and taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system, including cost of removal or abandonment of any property of grantee. 
B.  The corporate surety bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars during the entire term of a franchise, even if amounts have to be withdrawn pursuant to subsection A or C of this section. The grantee shall keep the same in force and effect at all times throughout the existence of the franchise and thereafter until grantee has liquidated all of its obligations with the city that may have arisen from the acceptance of the franchise ordinance by grantee or from the exercise of any right or privilege granted hereunder, including the removal of all poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other conductors and fixtures incident to the maintenance and operation of its cable system, should such removal be required by city council or undertaken by grantee upon the termination of the franchise. 
C.  If a grantee fails to pay to the city any compensation within the time fixed herein; or fails after ten days' notice to pay to the city any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the city within ten days any damages, costs or expenses which the city is compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with a franchise; or fails after ten days' notice by the city of such failure to comply with any provision of a franchise which the city reasonably determines can be remedied by demand on the corporate surety bond. The city may immediately require payment of the amount thereof with interest and any penalties from the corporate surety bond. 
D.  The rights reserved to the city with respect to the corporate surety bond are in addition to all other rights of the city whether reserved by a franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such corporate surety bond shall affect any other right the city may have.

C.  A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting interest of the grantee.

B.  The system, after the incorporation of such substitute services, shall satisfy the warranty made by grantee to subscriber and potential subscriber in its application for a franchise. The city council, on behalf of system subscribers, shall have the right to review any substitution of service or change in broad categories of programming that the grantee has made and may order a change therein if it determines, after due hearing on notice, that the warranty has been violated or that certain broad categories of programming and services that were committed by grantee in its proposal are not being delivered. Any such order shall issue only after a public hearing has been scheduled and held; and written notice of such hearing shall have been provided to the grantee and to the public at least thirty days prior to such hearing.

b.  Has not been specifically compensated for through a rate increase or other adjustment. 
D.  Notwithstanding subsections A and B, a grantee may take such actions to rearrange a particular service from one service tier to another, or otherwise offer the service, if the rates for all of the service tiers involved in such actions are not subject to regulation.

Chapter 8.16 - SMOKING POLLUTION CONTROL 
Sections: 
 
8.16.010 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the smoking pollution control ordinance. 
(Ord. 1488 § 1 (part), 1990)  
8.16.020 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  The city council finds that: 
1.  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution; and 
2.  Reliable studies have shown that breathing secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard for certain population groups, including elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease; and 
3.  Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer, respiratory infection, decreased exercise tolerance, decreased respiratory function, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm; and 
4.  Nonsmokers with allergies, respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same; and 
5.  Numerous studies have shown that a majority of both nonsmokers and smokers desire to have restrictions on smoking in public places and places of employment; 
6.  Smoking is a documented cause of fires; and cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic losses to businesses. 
B.  Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are: 1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in specified public places by regulating smoking in places of employment; and 2) to strike a reasonable balance between the needs of smokers and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that, where these needs conflict, the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority.

These conflicts often result in an involuntary curtailment or cessation of agricultural operations, are detrimental to the local economy, and discourage investment in such agricultural operations.

Editor's note Ord. No. 19147, § 2, adopted Nov. 1, 2017, repealed Ch. 8.30 in its entirety and enacted a new Ch. 8.30 to read as set out herein. Former Ch. 8.30, §§ 8.30.0108.30.060, pertained to marijuana cultivation and derived from Ord. No. 1898, § 1, adopted Oct. 15, 2014.

Chapter 9.10 - LOITERING BY MINORS PROHIBITED DURING CERTAIN HOURS 
 
9.10.010 - Findings. 
The city council finds and declares that the problems associated with minors loitering on city streets and in other public places between the hours of eleven p.m. and five a.m. is an increasing problem, creating a danger to both the public and to the minors by allowing such minors to be in contact with or have the opportunity for participation in street gangs, illegal drugs, and other unlawful activity while not under direct parental supervision. The city council further finds and declares that the problems associated with such juvenile loitering impair the use and enjoyment of public and private property by law abiding citizens, create enforcement problems for police, and generally make the city a less desirable place to live. It is therefore necessary for the city council to protect both the members of the public and the minors who are at risk by regulating certain conduct by minors while in designated public places. It is not the intention of the city council to place restrictions upon minors while in such public places which involve legal and constitutionally protected activities. 
(Ord. 1588 § 1 (part), 1993)  
9.10.020 - Loitering by minors prohibited during certain hours.

(Ord. 1588 § 1 (part), 1993)  
9.10.030 - Responsibility of parents or guardians. 
It is unlawful and a misdemeanor for any parent or guardian having the legal care or custody of a minor to knowingly allow or permit such minor to violate the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 1588 § 1 (part), 1993)  
9.10.040 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply: 
"Emergency" means an unforeseen situation involving the health, safety, or welfare of the minor, of the minor's employer, or a member of the minor's immediate family, and which requires the minor to be present in a public place between the hours of eleven p.m. and five a.m. of the following day.

(Ord. No. 1943, § 2, 5-23-2017)  
9.13.160 - Administrative penaltiesAppeals. 
A.  This chapter authorizes the imposition of administrative fines on any person or responsible person who violates any provision of this chapter in order to encourage and obtain compliance with the provisions of this chapter for the benefit and protection of the citizens of the city of Lodi. This Chapter governs the imposition, enforcement, collection, and administrative review of all administrative fines, related to: the possession, use, storage, sale and/or display of those fireworks classified as "Dangerous Fireworks" in California Health and Safety Code Section 12500, et seq., with the exception of a pyrotechnic licensee when operating pursuant to that license; and the use of "Safe and Sane Fireworks" as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 12500 et seq. on or at dates, times and/or locations other than those permitted by this chapter. Said administrative fines are imposed under authority of Government Code Section 53069.4, Health and Safety Code Section 12557, and the police power of the city of Lodi. 
B.  The issuance of citations imposing administrative fines may be performed at the discretion of the officials of the city of Lodi; and the issuance of a citation to any person or responsible person constitutes but one remedy of the city to redress violations of this chapter by any person or responsible person. By adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its authority to employ any other remedy, civil or criminal, to redress any violation of this chapter by any person or responsible person, which this city may otherwise pursue. 
C.  The imposition of fines related to "Dangerous Fireworks" under this chapter shall be limited to persons or responsible person(s) who possess, sell, use and/or display, or the seizure of, twenty-five pounds or less (gross weight) of such dangerous fireworks. 
D.  Fines collected pursuant to this chapter related to "Dangerous Fireworks" shall not be subject to Health and Safety Code Section 12706, which Section provides that certain fines collected by a court of the state be deposited with, and disbursed by, the county treasurer. However, the city shall provide cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal pursuant to regulations to be adopted by the state fire marshal addressing the state fire marshal's cost for the transportation and disposal of "Dangerous Fireworks" seized by the city, which costs will be part of any administrative fine imposed. Unless and until said regulations have been adopted by the state of California, the city shall hold in trust two hundred fifty dollars or twenty-five percent of any fine collected, whichever is greater, to cover the cost reimbursement to the state fire marshal for said cost of transportation and disposal of the "Dangerous Fireworks." 
E.  Because of the serious threat of fire or injury posed by the use of "Dangerous Fireworks" that can result from persistent or repeated failures to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the effect of such conditions or activities on the safety and the use and enjoyment of surrounding properties and to the public health, safety, and welfare, this chapter imposes strict civil liability upon the owners of real property for all violations of this chapter existing on their real property. Each individual use, display, and/or possession shall constitute a separate violation and each shall be subject to a separate administrative fine.

10.  Any other information deemed necessary by the director for enforcement or collection purposes.

On the second and each subsequent time that a person is issued a citation for the same violation in any twelve-month period, the fine is increased as indicated above and the citee shall be liable for the amount of the new fine until it is paid, in addition to being responsible for payment of previous fines. 
D.

E.  Upon confirmation of the citation or when the citation is deemed confirmed, all unpaid administrative fines, late fees, and/or interest shall constitute a judgment which may be collected in any manner allowed by law for collection of judgments including but not limited to recordation to create a lien on any real property owned by the responsible person.

C.  Citees must deposit the full amount of the penalty listed on the citation on or before the request for a hearing is filed.

B.  Administrative hearings are informal, and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. Photographs of seized fireworks shall be admissible evidence of the violation. The city bears the burden of proof to establish a violation and responsibility therefore by a preponderance of evidence. The citation is prima facie evidence of the violation, however, the CEO who issued the citation is required to attend or participate at the hearing. The citee(s) and CEO, if present, shall have an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. 
C.  A citee may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration executed under penalty of perjury.

The failure of a citee to receive a properly addressed decision shall not invalidate any hearing, city action, or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter.

Chapter 9.19 - SIDEWALK VENDORS 
 
9.19.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The provisions of this chapter are intended to comply with Government Code Sections 51036 through 51039 (signed into law on September 17, 2018) and are enacted subject to the findings in this section. 
The city council finds that the vending of produce and prepared or prepackaged foods, goods, wares, and/or services on sidewalks poses unsafe conditions and special dangers to the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the city of Lodi. It is the purpose and intent of the city council, in enacting this chapter, to provide persons who engage in those types of vending operations with clear and concise regulations to prevent safety, traffic, and health hazards, as well as to preserve the peace, safety, and welfare of the community. 
The city council further finds that parks and nature areas are a finite and valuable resource within the city. Public parks are designed and maintained to support the recreational activities for which they were intended and have inadequate facilities such as restrooms, water, sanitary services, and pedestrian and vehicle traffic flow necessary to support commercial vending activities. It is the purpose and intent of the city council, in enacting this chapter, to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public by regulating the use of parks, nature areas, and recreation facilities, to ensure the public's use and enjoyment of natural resources and recreational opportunities, and prevent an undue concentration of commercial activities that unreasonably interfere with the scenic and natural character of the parks.

Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof on private or public property, not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Definitions. As used in this chapter:

3.  A vehicle, or parts thereof, which is stored or parked in a lawful manner on private property in connection with the business of a licensed dismantler, licensed vehicle dealer, or junk dealer, or when such storage or parking is necessary to the operation of a lawfully-conducted business or commercial enterprise. Nothing in this section shall authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance as defined under provisions of law other than Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 22650) of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code and this chapter. 
D.  Nonexclusive Regulations. This chapter is not the exclusive regulation of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles within the city.

A.  The purpose of this article is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the city and its wildlife by prohibiting the feeding of waterfowl and migratory birds within city parks and lakes. Feeding waterfowl and migratory birds increases the potential for damage to the flora and fauna of public parks and lakes due to an accumulation of bird droppings, may harm water quality, and increase the potential for the spread of disease to city residents. 
B.  It is also the purpose of this article to protect the welfare of the waterfowl and migratory birds themselves, as wildlife studies have shown that feeding waterfowl and migratory birds can interrupt their normal migration patterns, cause nutritional problems, and promote the spread of bird diseases. 
C.  It is also the purpose of this article to minimize the attraction to waterfowl and migratory birds of residing within city parks and lakes by restricting their feeding and other acts that encourage the birds to halt their natural migration patterns.

New sources are required to comply with new source performance standards (NSPS) based on best available demonstrated control technology (BDT) for industrial users in terms of concentration and equivalent mass values. Users must comply with pretreatment standards promulgated pursuant to Section 307 and the Federal Register 40 CFR Subchapter IV. Dilution of any discharge may not be used to comply with any pretreatment standards. Categorical industrial users must submit baseline monitoring reports, compliance schedule reports, ninety-day compliance reports, and periodic reports on continued compliance as required including all information required by 40 CFR 403.12(l) and such reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and meet certification requirements of 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and 403.12(b)(6) and be retained for a minimum of three years (or period of litigation, whichever is longer). The city may issue standards more stringent than the federal standards if the public works director determines that the limitations in the federal standards are not sufficient to: 
A.  Protect the operation of the city's treatment facilities; or 
B.  Comply with water quality standards, sludge disposal or effluent limitations specified in the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit; 
C.  Meet technically based local limits, which must be calculated per federal pretreatment program guidelines. The city must annually provide public notification of industrial users which during the previous twelve months significantly violated applicable pretreatment standards. 
(Ord. No. 1819, 2-18-2009)  
13.12.125 - Required reports. 
The reports required by Section 13.12.120 shall comply with the following regulations: 
A.  Baseline Report. 
1.  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standard-baseline report. Within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)- (7) of 40CFR 403.12(b)(1)-(7). At least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge, New Sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the control authority a report which contains the information listed in paragraphs (b)(1)-(5) of 40CFR 403.12. New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of 40 CFR 403.12. 
a.  Identifying Information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
b.  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
c.  Description of Operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow Measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
i.  Regulated process streams; and 
ii.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of § 403.6(e). (See paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of 40 CFR403.12. 
The control authority may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
e.  Measurement of Pollutants. 
i.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
ii.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or control authority) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations. In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by the control authority or the applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard; 
iii.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph; 
iv.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of Section 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority; 
v.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator; 
vi.  The control authority may allow the submission of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
vii.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW; 
f.  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in paragraph (l) of this section) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
g.  Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
i.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (Section 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (Section 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (Section 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of 40 CFR 403.12 shall pertain to the modified limits. 
ii.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (Section 403.7), the combined wastestream formula (Section 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (Section 403.13) after the user submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any necessary amendments to the information requested by paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of 40 CFR 403.12 shall be submitted by the user to the control authority within sixty days after the modified limit is approved. 
2.  Compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by paragraph (b)(7) of 40 CFR 403.12: 
a.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc). 
b.  No increment referred to in paragraph 2.a. of this section shall exceed nine months. 
c.  Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the control authority including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the control authority. 
B.  Compliance Report. Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing the information described in paragraphs (b) (4)-(6) of 40 CFR 403.12. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in Section 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
C.  Periodic Reports on Continued Compliance. 
1.  Any industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard (except a non-significant categorical user as defined in Section 403.3(v)(2)), after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the control authority during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the control authority or the approval authority, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the discharge reported in paragraph (b)(4) of 40 CFR 403.12 except that the control authority may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required by the control authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. At the discretion of the control authority and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the control authority may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
2.  The control authority may authorize the industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. This authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
i.  The control authority may authorize a waiver where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
ii.  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit or other equivalent individual control mechanism, but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism. 
iii.  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section and include the certification statement in Section 403.6(a)(2)(ii). Non-detectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
iv.  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority must be included as a condition in the user's control mechanism. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the control authority for three years after expiration of the waiver. 
v.  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's control mechanism by the control authority, the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user: 
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR ___________ specify applicable National Pretreatment Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of ___________ [list pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last periodic report under 40 CFR 403.12(e)(1). 
vi.  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the user's operations, the user must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of 40 CFR 403.12 or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control authority; and notify the control authority. 
vii.  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard. 
3.  The control authority may reduce the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) of 40 CFR 403.12 to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the approval authority, where the industrial user meets all of the following conditions: 
i.  The industrial user's total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following: 
(A)  0.01 percent of the design dry weather hydraulic capacity of he POTW, or five thousand gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial user discharges in batches; 
(B)  0.01 percent of the design dry weather organic treatment capacity of the POTW; and 
(C)  0.01 percent of the maximum allowable headworks loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard for which approved local limits were developed by a POTW in accordance with Section 403.5(c) and paragraph (d) of 40 CFR 403.12; 
ii.  The industrial user has not been in significant noncompliance, as defined in Section 403.8(f)(2)(viii), for any time in the past two years; 
iii.  The industrial user does not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of 40 CFR 403.12; 
iv.  The industrial user must notify the control authority immediately of any changes at its facility causing it to no longer meet conditions of paragraphs (e)(3)(i) or (ii) of 40 CFR 403.12. Upon notification, the industrial user must immediately begin complying with the minimum reporting in paragraph (e)(1) of 40 CFR 403.12; and 
v.  The control authority must retain documentation to support the control authority's determination that a specific industrial user qualifies for reduced reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of 40 CFR 403.12 for a period of three years after the expiration of the term of the control mechanism. 
4.  For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the control authority in accordance with the procedures in Section 403.6(c), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) of 40 CFR 403.12 shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), the report required by paragraph (e)(1) shall include the user's actual average production rate for the reporting period. 
D.  Categorical Pretreatment Standard Compliance Reports. Significant non-categorical industrial users must submit to the control authority at least once every six months (on dates specified by the control authority) a description of the nature, concentration, and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by the control authority. In cases where a local limit requires compliance with a best management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the control authority to determine the compliance status of the user. These reports must be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered by the report, and in accordance with the techniques described in part 136 and amendments thereto. This sampling and analysis may be performed by the control authority in lieu of the significant non-categorical industrial user. 
E.  The reports required by paragraphs A, B, C and D at this section must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period as required by 40 CFR 403.12(g)(3). 
F.  If any industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in paragraphs C or D of this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the control authority, using the procedures prescribed below, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
1.  All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. (See, [Sections] 136.4 and 136.5.) Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR part 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutants in question, or where the administrator determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed using validated analytical methods or any other sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the administrator. 
(Ord. No. 1819, 2-18-2009)  
13.12.130 - Industrial waste permits. 
Source control of industrial discharges shall be accomplished by use of a permit and monitoring system as described in this chapter. Discharge of industrial waste from any person within the city onto land or to any natural outlet may be permitted only if the discharge complies with all requirements of the regional water quality control board and of all other local, state and federal laws and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1819, 2-18-2009)  
13.12.140 - Other legal restrictions. 
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit any additional requirements that may be imposed by the county health officer, by the regional water quality control board, fish and game, or by other governmental agencies having jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 1819, 2-18-2009)  
13.12.150 - Connections outside city. 
A.  Whereas: 
1.  San Joaquin County will retain its authority over land use approval for wineries located within county jurisdiction. 
2.  The city of Lodi's general plan contains the following land use element goals: 
a.  Policy LU-A.1 The city shall seek to preserve Lodi's small-town and rural qualities. 
b.  Policy LU-A.4The city shall promote reinvestment in downtown Lodi and in the Eastside area that upgrades the general quality of development in these areas. 
c.  Goal LU-BTo preserve agricultural land surrounding Lodi and to discourage premature development of agricultural land with nonagricultural uses, while providing for urban needs. 
d.  Policy LU-B.1The city shall encourage the preservation of agricultural land surrounding the city. 
e.  Policy LU-B.2The city should designate a continuous open space greenbelt around the urbanized area of Lodi to maintain and enhance the agricultural economy. 
f.  Policy LU-B.6The city shall encourage San Joaquin County to retain agricultural uses on lands adjacent to the city. 
g.  Goal LU-DTo promote and retain development in downtown Lodi. 
h.  Policy LU-D.1The city shall preserve and promote downtown Lodi and the city's social and cultural center and an economically viable retail and professional office district. 
i.  Policy LU-D.3The city shall enhance pedestrian activity and pedestrian amenities in downtown Lodi. 
3.  The city encourages compact development and discourages leapfrog development and urban sprawl within the Highway 12/Interstate 5 corridor, all of which would be inconsistent with the above general plan goals. The city's general plan is committed to the above goals within its own boundaries as well, stating the following: 
a.  A-5 The city shall require specific development plans in areas of major new development. 
b.  E-2 The city shall promote downtown Lodi as the primary pedestrian-oriented, commercial area of Lodi. 
c.  E-4 The city shall ensure the new commercial development be designed to avoid the appearance of strip development. 
d.  E-7 In approving new commercial projects, the city shall seek to ensure that such projects reflect the city's concern for achieving and maintaining high quality development. 
4.  Providing wastewater treatment service to Flag City on the condition that service not be afforded to developments that conflict with the goals set forth herein furthers those goals by concentrating development in an existing county service area with set boundaries. 
5.  County acknowledges the goals set forth in the Lodi general plan as set forth above and has similar provisions in its general plan which encourage agricultural uses, compact land use and development, and discourage "leap frog development" and "urban sprawl." Toward these ends, the county general plan provides: 
a.  To make efficient use of land and promote a functional development pattern with varied and compatible land uses. 
b.  To minimize the effect on agricultural lands and other environmental resources while providing for orderly growth. 
c.  To create a visually attractive county. 
d.  To avoid the problems and costs imposed on local government by development that does not have adequate services. 
e.  Rural communities shall: 
i.  Be planned to have minimal growth, mainly infill development, with expansion discouraged; 
ii.  Be planned to serve the immediate needs of the community's residents or the surrounding agricultural community; 
iii.  Have a minimum land area of fifty acres or have been identified on the general plan 1995 map as a residential area. 
f.  Development shall be orderly and compact. 
g.  Development should occur on vacant lots within existing communities as "infill" before extending beyond the current developed areas of a community. 
h.  Freeway Service. 
i.  Function. Provide for commercial uses oriented almost exclusively to serving the needs of the freeway traveler. 
ii.  Typical Uses. Travel-related businesses including gasoline service stations, food and beverage sales, eating and drinking establishments, and hotels and motels. 
iii.  Development and Locational Criteria. Freeway service areas shall be: 
(A)  Designated only adjacent to full freeway interchanges where development will be easily accessible and visible to the freeway traveler; 
(B)  Limited in number to encourage clustering of uses at selected interchanges; 
(C)  Limited in area in order to reduce impacts on surrounding land uses and control the physical and visual extent of these areas; 
(D)  Developed so that buildings occupy no more than sixty percent of the lot and are no more than three stories in height; and 
(E)  Designed in an attractive manner that creates a favorable impression of the county by considering the overall site design, landscaping, scale of development, signage, relationship to adjacent uses, circulation and parking, and architecture. 
6.  There is a need for upgraded sewer treatment facilities to service Flag City and the parties wish to cooperatively ensure that any development that occurs in Flag City is orderly, compact and in compliance with the goals of the city and county general plans. 
B.  Now therefore be it further ordained as follows: 
1.  Service Outside Lodi. Except as set forth below, no discharge from private facilities or properties outside the city of Lodi shall be allowed into the domestic sewerage or storm drainage systems. The city council may by contract allow connection from: (1) winery facilities outside Lodi to the industrial sewerage system on the terms set forth in this section so long as the system has adequate existing capacity to service the waste (2) publicly owned wastewater systems ("public district") to the domestic wastewater treatment system on terms set forth in this section so long as the system has adequate existing capacity to service the waste. 
2.  Terms of Private Industrial Connection. Any winery wastewater connection permitted pursuant to the contract called for in this section shall contain the following minimum terms: 
a.  Permit. Applicant shall comply with the terms of the industrial system discharge permit to be issued by the city, which will include but not be limited to limitations on flow, BOD, ph, TDS, and suspended solid concentrations and prohibitions on discharge of hazardous waste in conformance with the city's discharge permit. 
b.  Rate/Surcharge. Winery's rate for discharge shall be set at one hundred fifty percent of the city's standard published rate for industrial waste. 
c.  Capacity Charge. Winery shall pay a one-time capacity charge based on annual flow and BOD loading prior to connection per this chapter. 
d.  Non-Assignment. Applicant may not sell capacity or accept wastewater from other locations. 
e.  Downtown Retail Presence. Applicant shall open and operate a wine tasting room to market its products in downtown Lodi during the entire term of its connection to the city's sewer system. The establishment shall be operated within the following minimum requirements: 
i.  It shall be at least five hundred square feet, have its products available for sampling and sale, and be open a minimum of forty hours per week, including Saturday and Sunday and shall be located in downtown Lodi as defined by the area bordered by Church Street, Lodi Avenue, Lockeford Street, and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. 
ii.  If this condition cannot be met within twelve months of connection, applicant shall pay an annual downtown development and promotional in-lieu fee in the amount established by the city council. The fee shall be retroactive for one year and shall be assessed annually (until such time as the requirements of subsection i of this paragraph have been satisfied) as annually adjusted according to the Bay Area-All Items Consumer Price Index. If condition i. above cannot be met within six years of connection, this agreement will terminate and applicant will be required to make alternate arrangements for its wastewater. 
f.  Annexation. Applicant, in consideration for receiving city sewer service, will consent to the annexation to the city of Lodi of its property served by the city industrial sewerage system, waives any right to protest the annexation, and assigns to the city any right to vote on the annexation. Annexation shall occur when and if the city deems the annexation of the subject property feasible and advisable.

B.  Construction. 
1.  Any person performing construction activities in the city shall prevent pollutants from entering the stormwater conveyance system and comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances or regulations, including but not limited to, the current California NPDES General Permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity (construction general permit) and this chapter. All construction projects, regardless of size, having soil disturbance or activities exposed to stormwater must, at a minimum, implement BMPs for erosion and sediment controls, soil stabilization, dewatering, source controls, pollution prevention measures, and prohibited discharges. 
2.  Any person subject to a construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official prior to, or as a condition of, a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, grading permit, or development or improvement plan, upon inspection of the facility, during any enforcement proceeding or action, or for any other reasonable cause. Prior to issuance of a construction permit or approval of the proposed improvement plans, for projects subject to the state's current construction NPDES general permit, the WDID number and the SWPPP shall be submitted to the city. For projects with less than an acre of soil disturbance or not subject to the construction general permit, an erosion and sediment control plan (ESCP) and the ESCP worksheet must be submitted to the city. 
3.  As required by its Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit, the city will conduct stormwater compliance inspections at applicable construction sites that have areas of soil disturbance exposed to stormwater. The inspection will be conducted by a city inspector or agent working for the city who is a qualified SWPPP practitioner (QSP) or is supervised by a QSP. The inspection will evaluate the construction site's compliance to the city's stormwater ordinances. Inspections will be billed by the city to the project owner. The following is the risk rating system and inspection frequency the city will use, which is analogous to the risk rating used by the California Construction General Permit. 
a.  Projects not subject to the construction general permit (CGP) or that have an erosivity waiver will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection and a project completion inspection. 
b.  Projects that are Risk 1/Linear Underground/Overhead Projects (LUP) Type 1 or Risk 2/LUP Type 2 will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection, monthly inspections, and a project completion inspection. 
c.  Projects that are Risk 3/LUP Type 3 will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection, bi-monthly (twice per month) inspections, and a project completion inspection. 
C.  Development. 
1.  The enforcement official may require controls as appropriate to minimize the long-term, post-construction activity discharge of stormwater pollutants from new development(s) or modifications to existing development(s). Controls may include source control measures to prevent pollution of stormwater, treatment controls designed to remove pollutants from stormwater, low impact development measures, and/or hydromodification measures to offset the difference between the pre- and post-construction peak flow runoff rates and volumes. Proponents of all applicable development and redevelopment projects will be required to meet the requirements and design standards specified in the current State of California Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit and as described in further detail in the city's Stormwater Design Standards Manual for New Development and Redevelopment. 
2.  At the earliest planning stages, project proponents shall assess and evaluate how site conditions, such as soils, vegetation, and flow paths will influence the placement of buildings and paved surfaces. The evaluation will be used to optimize the site layout to meet the goals of capturing and treating runoff. Each project proponent will submit a map of the project dividing the site into discrete drainage management areas to show in each how runoff will be managed using site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydromodification measures as defined by the current MS4 permit. All site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydromodification measures must be selected, sized, and situated in accordance with the guidance provided in the current MS4 permit and the city's Stormwater Design Standards Manual for New Development and Redevelopment. Documentation of the site's post-construction stormwater design measures must be submitted to the city's public works department for review and approval prior to the commencement of the project. 
3.  Project proponents must sign an operation and maintenance agreement in which they legally bind themselves to maintain the installed post-construction design measures in an effective and good operational condition until the property ownership is transferred. A written operation and maintenance plan for the proposed stormwater design measures is required to be submitted to and approved by the city with the signed agreement. The agreement will be recorded with the deed by the county clerk making it transferrable to the new owner; or, when there are multiple property owners responsible for the maintenance of the control measures, the agreement will consist of a legally binding covenant between the city and the homeowners association or maintenance district. The owner or association responsible for the maintenance of the control measures may be required by the city to submit an annual self-certification that the stormwater control measures are effective and are being maintained in accordance with the submitted and approved operation and maintenance plan. 
4.  Any person subject to the state's current construction NPDES general permit for stormwater discharge shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, and development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause and shall provide copies of permits and applicable reports to the enforcement official upon request. 
5.  Any person performing construction in the city shall prevent pollutants from entering the stormwater conveyance system and comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances or regulations including but not limited to the state general permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activity and the city grading, erosion and sediment control policies. 
D.  Compliance with General Permits. Each industrial discharger, discharger associated with construction activity, or other discharger subject to any general stormwater permit issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the State Water Resources Control Board, the Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Valley Region or the city shall comply with the requirements of such permit, and shall provide copies of permits and applicable reports to the enforcement official upon request. 
E  Compliance with Best Management Practices. Every person undertaking any activity or use of a premises which may cause or contribute to stormwater pollution or contamination, illegal discharges, or non-stormwater discharges shall comply with best management practice (BMPs) consistent with the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Best Management Practice Handbooks or equivalent guidelines.

13.14.260 - ReimbursementOversize mains. 
Whenever the city requires that a storm drain larger than eighteen inches in diameter be installed in order to serve additional property or to conform to the applicable master plan, the applicant may apply for a reimbursement agreement to the city in order to be reimbursed for the oversized pipe by the benefitting property(s). The reimbursement shall be based on the difference in cost between the actual pipe to be installed and an eighteen-inch storm drain as applicable. The difference in cost shall be determined by the public works director. The reimbursement shall be made in accordance with Chapter 17.62. 
(Ord. No. 1905, § 1, 6-3-2015)  
Article VI. - Administration 
 
13.14.310 - Monitoring facilities. 
A.  The public works director may require a commercial/industrial user to construct and maintain, at the user's expense, monitoring facilities which meet all government safety regulations (OSHA) to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building internal storm drainage systems and may also require sampling or metering equipment to be provided, installed, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the public works director may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user or the city, require the facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
B.  When the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow access for the enforcement official, such as a gate secured with a city lock. There shall be ample room in or near such monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The monitoring facility shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
C.  Whether constructed on public or private property, plans and specifications shall be approved by the public works director and be in accordance with all applicable city construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within sixty days following written notification by the city, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. 
(Ord. No. 1905, § 1, 6-3-2015)  
13.14.320 - Inspection, sampling, monitoring and analysis. 
The enforcement official may inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where stormwater is discharged shall allow the public works director or designated representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection or sampling or in performance of any of their duties. The enforcement official shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, the enforcement official will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. The user may be charged a fee to recover the costs for inspection (investigations), sampling, monitoring and analyses performed by the city to establish billing rates and to ensure compliance with all regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1905, § 1, 6-3-2015)  
13.14.340 - Confidential information. 
A.  All information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit application, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless (1) the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the public works director that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods that would be detrimental to the user's competitive position; and (2) disclosure is not required by the California Public Records Act. 
B.  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to governmental agencies for use in making studies per 40 CFR 403.14; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.

Article VII. - Enforcement 
 
13.14.410 - Inspection authority. 
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever an authorized enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of this chapter, the enforcement official may enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the officer by this chapter. Any request for entry shall state that the property owner or occupant has the right to refuse entry and that in the event that such entry is refused, inspection may be made upon issuance of a warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event the owner or occupant refuses entry after such request has been made, the enforcement official is empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. Inspections shall be based upon such reasonable selection processes as may be deemed necessary to carry out the objectives of this chapter, including but not limited to, random sampling and/or sampling in areas with evidence of stormwater contamination, illegal discharge, non-stormwater discharge to the stormwater conveyance system, or similar factors. 
A.  Sampling Authority. During any inspection, the enforcement official may take samples as necessary in order to implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. This authority may include the installation of sampling and metering devices on private property, or requiring the person owning or occupying the premises to supply samples. 
B.  Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Authority. The enforcement official may require monitoring, analysis and reporting of discharges from any premises to the stormwater conveyance system. Upon service of written notice by the enforcement official, the burden, including cost, of these activities, analyses and reports, incurred in complying with the requirement shall, to the extent permitted by law, be borne by the property owner or occupant of the facility or activity for which testing and monitoring has been requested. 
(Ord. No. 1905, § 1, 6-3-2015)  
13.14.420 - Enforcement authority. 
The enforcement official may exercise any enforcement powers authorized or provided in this code, including without limitation, administrative penalties pursuant to this code, as may be necessary to effectively implement and enforce this chapter. 
A.  Administrative Enforcement Powers. The enforcement official may also exercise any of the following supplemental enforcement powers as may be necessary or advisable in the enforcement official's judgment under the circumstances: 
1.  Notice of Violation (NOV). Whenever the enforcement official finds that any person owning or occupying a premises has violated or is violating this chapter or an order issued hereunder, the enforcement official may serve, by personal service, or by registered or certified mail, upon said person a written NOV. Within thirty days of the receipt of this notice, or sooner as may be prescribed in the NOV, the person so noticed shall submit to the enforcement official an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, which shall include specific required actions. Submission of this plan shall in no way relieve the person of liabilities for violations occurring before or after receipt of the NOV. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a NOV shall constitute a violation of this chapter. If a person fails to comply with the NOV, the enforcement official may perform, or cause to be performed, such work as shall be necessary to correct the violation. The costs of any such work shall be borne by the property owner, and shall be collectable in accordance with the provisions of subsection (A)(9). 
2.  Cease and Desist Orders. The enforcement official may require any person owning or occupying premises to cease and desist all activities that may cause or contribute to discharge in violation of this chapter. This order may also require such person to: (i) comply with the applicable provisions of this chapter within a designated period of time; or (ii) take appropriate remedial or preventative action to keep the violation from recurring. 
3.  Notice to Clean and Abate. The enforcement official may require any person owning or occupying premises to clean up and abate any release of pollutants on those premises which may result in a violation of this chapter. The enforcement official may also order abatement of activities or practices which may reasonably be expected to result in such a violation. 
4.  Mitigation. The enforcement official shall have authority to order the mitigation of circumstances which may result in or contribute to illegal discharges. 
5.  Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The enforcement official shall have the authority to establish elements of a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and to require any business to adopt and implement such a plan, as may be reasonable and necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. 
6.  Best Management Practices. The enforcement official may establish the requirements of best management practices for any premises. 
7.  Violations Constituting Misdemeanors. In addition to civil penalties provided for in this chapter, any violation of this chapter may be punishable as a misdemeanor as provided by Section 1.08.010 of this code. 
8.  Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the penalties hereinbefore provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a threat to the public health, safety or welfare and is thus deemed a nuisance. Any such nuisance may be summarily abated and/or restored by any authorized enforcement official. The city attorney is authorized to pursue civil action(s) pursuant to subsection B of this section to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of the nuisance. 
9.  Cost Recovery. The cost of the abatement and restoration shall be borne by the owner of the property and the cost therefore shall be invoiced to the owner of the property. If the invoice is not paid within sixty days, the enforcement official shall have the authority to place a lien upon and against the property. If the lien is not satisfied within three months, the enforcement official is authorized to take all legal measures as are available to enforce the lien as a judgment, including, without limitation, enforcing the lien in an action brought for a money judgment or by delivery to the county assessor or a special assessment against the property in accordance with Government Code Section 38773.5. 
10.  Seasonal and Recurrent Nuisance. If any violation of this chapter constitutes a seasonal and recurrent nuisance, the enforcement official shall so declare. Thereafter such seasonal and recurrent nuisance shall be abated every year. 
11.  Costs of Enforcement. If the city prevails in any administrative, civil or criminal proceeding initiated under this chapter, the city shall be entitled to seek reimbursement for all costs incurred in connection with said proceeding. Such reimbursable expenses may include, but are not limited to, costs of investigation, administrative overhead, out-of-pocket expenses, costs of administrative hearings, and costs of suit. If any such costs are granted to the city, said costs shall be recoverable pursuant to subsection (A)(9) of this section. 
12.  Administrative Citation. 
a.  If the owner, or person responsible for the violation, fails to correct the violation within the time specified in the NOV, cease and desist orders, or notice to clean and abate, the enforcement official may cause a violation citation imposing an administrative fine or penalty to be issued to the owner of the property (California Government Code Section 53069.4). 
b.  Any citation issued shall: 
i.  Identify the date, time and circumstances of the violation; 
ii.  State the amount of the penalty to be assessed; 
iii.  Advise the person of their appeal rights as provided herein. 
c.  The citation shall be served in the same manner as the NOV. In determining the amount of penalty to be assessed, consideration will be given to the following: 
i.  The extent to which the owner or person responsible for the violation had knowledge or reasonably should have known that the action taken was a violation of this chapter; 
ii.  The magnitude of the violation; 
iii.  The extent to which the owner or person responsible for the violation derived a financial benefit from the violation; 
iv.  Any prior history of related violations by the same person on the subject property or on other parcels within the city; and 
v.  Any corrective action, or lack thereof, taken by the owner or person responsible to eliminate the violations, and any other mitigating circumstances justifying a reduction of the amount of the penalties; and 
vi.  The amount of the penalty shall be derived as outlined in the city's stormwater enforcement response plan or as established and approved by the city council from time to time by resolution. 
d.  Any person receiving a citation may request an appeal as provided in Section 1.10.250 of the Lodi Municipal Code. 
e.  If the owner of the property fails to pay the penalty assessed under this section upon demand by the city, the penalty shall be specially assessed against the parcel. The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as are provided for ordinary County taxes. A notice of abatement lien shall be recorded and shall become a lien on the property pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code Section 38773.5. The director of public works is authorized to prepare and record a notice of release of lien against the legal title of the subject property(s), if the penalty is paid in full. 
B.  Civil Actions. In addition to any other remedies provided in this chapter, any violation of this chapter may be enforced by civil action brought by the city attorney. Monies recovered under this subsection shall be paid to the city to be used exclusively for costs associated with monitoring and establishing stormwater discharge pollution control systems and/or implementing or enforcing the provisions of this chapter. In any such action, the city may seek, as appropriate, any or all of the following remedies: 
1.  A temporary and/or permanent injunction; 
2.  Assessment of the violator for the costs of any investigation, inspection, or monitoring survey which led to the establishment of the violation, and for the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing legal action under this subsection; 
3.  Costs incurred in removing, correcting or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation; 
4.  Compensatory damages for loss or destruction to water quality, wildlife, fish and aquatic life not to exceed six thousand dollars per day, per occurrence in which such violations occur. The city attorney, upon order of the city council, shall petition the superior court to impose, assess and recover such sums. This penalty is in addition to any penalties which may be imposed by the State Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Environmental Protection Agency. Should the damage also cause the city to be cited for a violation of state or federal requirements, the cost of said citation will be passed onto the offending party. 
C.  Authority to Arrest or Issue Citations. Any authorized enforcement official shall have and is vested with the authority to arrest or cite and release any person who violates any section of this chapter in the manner provided by the California Penal Code for the arrest or release on citation of misdemeanors or infractions as described by Chapters 5, 5(c) and 5(d) of Title 3, Part 2 of the California Penal Code (or as the same may hereafter be amended). Such authorized enforcement official may issue citations and notice to appear in the manner prescribed by Chapter 5(c) of Title 3, Part 2 of the California Penal Code, including Section 853.6 (or as the same may hereafter be amended). It is the intent of the city council that the immunities prescribed in Section 836.5 of the California Penal Code be applicable to public officers or employees acting in the course and scope of employment pursuant to this chapter. 
D.  Emergency Orders and Abatements. The enforcement official may order the immediate abatement of any discharge from any source to the stormwater conveyance system when, in the opinion of the enforcement official, the discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition which presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety, or welfare, or the environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit. 
1.  Abatement and cleanup of spills, illicit discharges, or dumping to the storm drainage system must occur within seventy-two hours of notification; or sooner for high risk spills or discharges. For areas of uncontrolled pollutant sources, abatement must be performed within thirty days of notification. 
2.  In emergency situations where the property owner or other responsible party is unavailable and time constraints are such that service of a notice and order to abate cannot be effected without presenting an immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, or the environment or a violation of a NPDES permit, the city may perform or cause to be performed such work as shall be necessary to abate said threat or danger. 
3.  The costs of any such abatement shall be borne by the owner and shall be collectable in accordance with the provisions of subsection (A)(9) of this section. 
4.  The enforcement official may order the immediate cessation of any activities that cause an illicit discharge or cause or potentially cause uncontrolled pollutants to enter the stormwater conveyance system when, in the opinion of the enforcement official, the activities present an imminent danger to the public health, safety, welfare or environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit. Activities may not resume until the enforcement official has verified that the threat to the environment and the city's MS4 has been abated. 
E.  Contents of Notice of Violation. Any NOV, cease and desist order, or other civil notice or civil order issued by the enforcement official pursuant to this chapter shall include the following: 
1.  The street address, parcel number, and/or a legal description sufficient for identification of the property where the violation exists and the address of the person responsible for or committing the act that constitutes a violation of this chapter. 
2.  A brief and concise description of the violation or use of the property or act that constitutes a violation of this chapter.

13.20.225 - Schedule NEMNet energy metering rider. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this rider is to establish rates, terms, and conditions for providing net metering services to customers generating electricity using solar and wind facilities of one MW or less in size. This rider complies with California State legislation requiring every electric utility in the state, including municipally-owned utilities, to develop a standard contract or tariff providing for net energy metering, as defined below. 
B.  Applicability. This schedule is applicable to service for customers where a part or all of the electrical requirements of the customer can be supplied from a solar or wind power production source owned and operated by the customer (customer-generated). Availability of this schedule to eligible customer-generators will be on a first-come, first-served basis and will be available until such time the total rated generating capacity used by eligible customer-generators equals five percent of the city of Lodi aggregate customer annual peak demand. 
The solar or wind generation source must: 1) have a capacity of one MW or less, 2) be located on the customer-generator's premises, 3) be connected for parallel operation with Lodi's distribution facilities, and 4) be intended for the sole purpose of offsetting a part or all of the customer-generator's own electrical requirements. In no case shall the power or energy generated by the customer-owned solar or wind source be available for resale, except as specified under this rider. 
Additional terms and conditions for service, including terms of interconnection and parallel operation, are specified in a customer-specific Electrical Interconnection and Net Energy Metering Payment Agreement. 
C.  Rates. Charges for electricity supplied by the city will be based on metered usage in accordance with special conditions (D)(3) and (5) below. Rates charged under this schedule will be in accordance with the eligible customer-generator's otherwise applicable rate schedule. Public benefit charges and monthly customer charges shall not be by-passable. 
D.  Special Conditions. 
1.  Other Agreements. A signed electrical interconnection and net metering payment agreement between the customer-generator and the city is required for service under this schedule. 
2.  Metering Equipment. Net energy metering shall be accomplished using a single meter capable of registering the flow of electricity in two directions. If customer's existing electrical meter is not capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions, the customer-generator shall be responsible for all expenses involved in purchasing and installing a meter that is capable of measuring electricity in both directions. 
Co-energy metering customers transferred to net metering pursuant to Section 13.20.227 of this Code, may remain on the dual meter system. Net energy metering customers, at their election may opt for the dual meter system. 
3.  Net Energy Metering and Billing. Net energy is defined as measuring the difference between the electricity supplied by the city through the electric grid to the eligible customer-generator and electricity generated by an eligible customer-generator and fed back into the electric grid over a twelve-month period. 
In the event that the electricity supplied by the city during the twelve-month period exceeds the electricity generated by the eligible customer-generator during the same period, the eligible customer is a net electricity consumer and the city shall bill the customer for the net consumption during the twelve-month period based on the retail price per kilowatt-hour for eligible customer-generator's rate class over the same period. 
The city shall provide the customer-generator with net electricity consumption information on each regular bill. That information shall include the current amount owed to the city for the net electricity consumed. Customer-generator may exercise the option to pay monthly for the net energy consumed, but in any event shall be responsible for any payments due at the end of each twelve-month period. 
4.  Attributes. Any capacity attributes or environmental attributes associated with the renewable energy produced by the customer-generator at sites subject to this schedule shall belong to the city with the sole exception of renewable energy credits for solar and wind generation up to the amount of on-site consumption. Capacity attributes include, but are not limited to, system resource adequacy capacity and local resource adequacy capacity, if any. Environmental attributes include, but are not limited to, renewable portfolio standard recognition, renewable energy credits, greenhouse gas credits, and emission reduction credits, if any. 
5.  Excess Energy. Net energy metering will be administered on an annualized basis, beginning with the month of interconnection of the customer's generating system with the city's electrical system. Electric solar and wind generation production may result in a dollar credit carrying forward to the next billing period. If a credit accumulation results in a net customer-owned generation credit at the end of the annualized year, unused dollar credits will be set to zero and not be carried into the new annualized year unless the customer-generator affirmatively elects to be paid for such excess. If the customer-generator so elects, the city shall either pay the customer-generator or credit the customer generator's account for such excess at the baseline energy cost rate specified in Schedule ECA plus the energy cost adjustment rate averaged for the billing periods with excess generation. 
6.  Rules and Regulations. Other conditions specified in the city of Lodi electric utility department's rules, regulations and engineering standards shall apply to this electric rate schedule.

13.20.280 - Schedule G5General serviceGroup 5 commercial/industrial. 
A.  Applicability. This schedule shall be applied to accounts with billing period demands of one thousand kilowatts (kW) or more for three consecutive months, unless the customer elects an optional rate schedule the account would otherwise qualify. 
Demand: The billing period and peak period demands will be the maximum average power taken during any fifteen-minute interval in the billing period and peak period, respectively, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. In cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a five-minute interval may be used. 
Assignment to Schedule: If, in the judgment of the city, an account is expected to have billing period demand of one thousand kW or more per billing cycle, the city has the option of placing the account immediately on this schedule. 
When an account billed on this schedule permanently changes the nature of electrical operations to such an extent that the account would in time qualify for another rate schedule, such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the city of any such change. 
If billing period demand drops below one thousand kW and remains there for twelve consecutive billing cycles, the city will transfer the account to the appropriate rate schedule.

13.20.290 - Schedule EPEnergy purchase. 
APPLICABILITY: 
This schedule is applicable to qualifying customer-owned and operated generating alternating current (AC) facilities operating in parallel with the City's electric distribution system. The customer-generator must currently be, or will be, served by the city of Lodi Electric Utility (LEU). 
Generating facilities must be rated 1 MW CEC-AC or less, located on the customer-generator's premises, and intended for the purpose of offsetting a part or all of the customer-generator's own electrical requirements. In no case shall the energy, capacity, and/or other attributes be available for resale by the customer. 
This schedule is available only to customers who do not otherwise qualify for compensation for customer-owned generation under another LEU rate schedule or contract. 
RATES: 
Energy Charges: Customer will be billed for all usage at the applicable service rate in effect when the electric service was rendered in accordance with the eligible customer-generator's otherwise applicable rate schedule based on metered usage for energy delivered and received after the customer-generator serves its own instantaneous load. 
Energy Purchase Credit: Credit will be provided to the customer for all metered customer-generated energy that exceeds the energy consumed, and is therefore exported to LEU's distribution system, at a rate equal to the avoided cost to LEU; the specific value of which will be determined and updated annually by LEU based on the following components: avoided energy and transmission costs, environmental attribute value (if applicable, based on generation type), avoided system loss, and avoided capacity value. 
Energy purchase credit values will be published each year by June 1 on LEU's website and provided to customers receiving service under this schedule. 
The above charges and credits will be determined in accordance with LEU's metering specifications. LEU reserves the right to install additional metering equipment for statistical and/or billing purposes. 
BILLING: 
For each billing month, the customer shall receive a bill including all applicable energy charges, including, but not limited to, customer charges, energy charges, demand charges, and any surcharges, taxes, and/or discounts in accordance with their otherwise applicable rate schedule. The bill will also include all applicable energy purchase credits which shall be used to offset the energy charges in a given billing month. Any credit(s) remaining at the end of each billing month shall carry forward and be applied to the customer's next monthly electric bill. Any outstanding charges will be due and payable at the end of each billing month. Monthly customer charges, public benefit charges, and all other surcharges shall be non-bypassable. 
SPECIAL CONDITIONS: 
Other conditions shall apply to this schedule as specified in the city of Lodi Electric Utility Department's Rules and Regulations, as updated from time to time, and engineering standards and specifications (including metering requirements) which are available for review on LEU's website. 
Customers will be responsible for any and all metering and interconnection charges as required to provide service under this schedule. Said charges will be determined and updated annually by LEU and be based on the cost(s) associated with providing service under this schedule. A schedule of charges will be available on LEU's website. 
Any capacity or environmental attributes associated, now or in the future, with the credited excess energy produced by the customer-generator at sites subject to this schedule shall belong to the city. Capacity attributes include, but are not limited to, system, local, and/or flexible resource adequacy capacity, if any. Environmental attributes include, but are not limited to, renewables portfolio standard eligible resources, renewable energy credits, greenhouse gas credits, and/or emission reduction credits, if any. 
LEU reserves the right to require a contract should it determine the customer-owned generator does not otherwise meet the specified applicability requirements to qualify under this schedule or another LEU rate schedule. 
Customers currently taking service under schedule NEM shall continue to be billed in accordance with schedule NEM for twenty years from the date of interconnection of their existing customer-owned generation facility, after which time they will be given the option to take service under this schedule EP in order to continue to receive credit for their customer-owned generation. 
(Ord. No. 1941, § 1, 5-3-2017; Ord. No. 1944, § 1, 8-2-2017)  
13.20.300 - Schedule SSStandby service. 
A.  Applicability. This schedule is applicable to commercial/industrial customers who would otherwise qualify for Schedule G2, G3, G4, G5, or I1 and who have privately-owned generating facilities with a combined nameplate rating greater than one megawatt on their premises and where the city must stand ready to supply electric service to replace such a facility. This schedule will apply in addition to any other schedule applicable to the customer of record; any multiple generation facilities for one customer of record will be under one contract. 
B.  Service by Contract. Service under this schedule shall be provided on a contract basis to commercial/industrial customers who have privately- owned generating facilities on their premises. Contracts shall be subject to terms approved by the city council and shall obligate the customer to pay the city for its costs associated with providing standby service for the actual life of the privately-owned generating facilities and for three months following written notice to the City of Lodi Electric Utility of the removal of the privately-owned generating facilities from operation. 
(Ord. No. 1941, § 1, 5-3-2017)  
13.20.310 - Schedule I1General serviceGroup 5 commercial/industrial-optional. 
A.  Applicability. This schedule is an optional rate for accounts who would otherwise qualify for primary service under the G5 rate schedule with billing period demands of one thousand kilowatts (kW) or more for three consecutive months. 
Demand: The billing period and peak period demands will be the maximum average power taken during any fifteen-minute period interval in the billing period and peak period, respectively, but not less than the diversified resistance welder load. In cases where the use of energy is intermittent or subject to violent fluctuations, a five-minute interval may be used. 
Assignment to Schedule: Assignment to this schedule is at the option of the customer and does not supersede any standby service contracts. 
This rate schedule is prospective and not subject to rebate or retroactivity. 
When a customer chooses to be assigned to this schedule, the customer elects the city of Lodi (city) to be the sole electric power requirements provider of choice. The customer must give the city three-year written notice before the customer can elect to use another electric power requirements provider. 
When a customer has a measurable incremental permanent load increase of two hundred kW or greater, over the highest billing period demand in the previous twelve months the customer will be eligible for a ten percent discount on the incremental demand and energy charges. Such billing change will be made as soon as practicable after verification of said changes and is not subject to rebate or retroactivity. It shall be the responsibility of the customer to notify the city of any such change. 
When an account billed on this schedule qualifies for another city bundled rate schedule, the customer may elect to be billed on that other rate schedule. When a customer chooses to be assigned to another bundled rate a three-year written notice is still required before the customer can elect to use another electric power requirements provider. 
If the billing period demand drops below one thousand kW and remains there for twelve consecutive billing cycles, the city will transfer the account to the appropriate rate schedule and the customer will be subject to the requirements of the appropriate schedule, rather than Schedule I1.

15.20.380 - Changes or Modifications. 
In accordance with Health and Safety Code Section 17958.5, the adoption of amendments more restrictive than the requirements contained in the provisions published in the California Building Standard Code, are needed because of local conditions, as specified below: 
(A)  Climatic. 
(1)  Conditions. Precipitation averages 18 inches per year and can reach as high as 35 inches per year. Virtually all of the rain occurs during the months of October through April. The remaining months receive little or no rain. Temperatures during the summer months can reach as high as 110 and City of Lodi averages 19 days over 100 each year. Relative humidity during these summer months is very low. Lodi averages 34 days of dense fog per year, and has had as many as 64 foggy days. 
(2)  Impacts. The generally dry, hot summer months create extreme fire conditions. Adding to this situation is the dryness and combustibility of many structures during the summer, especially true of structures with wood siding and roofs constructed of wood shakes and shingles. The cyclical uncertainty that allow weather events can cause rapid melting of the snow pack, which causes flood potential in areas surrounding the Mokelumne River. The foggy conditions can inhibit the dispatch and timeliness of emergency equipment reaching the site of a fire. During foggy periods, it is common place for visibility to be near zero, which results in emergency equipment having to decrease their speed to less than 25 miles per hour. 
(B)  Geographic. 
(1)  Conditions. The City of Lodi is subject to ground tremors from seismic events as the County is in seismic Category D. The Mokelumne River, which borders the northern city limits, is subjected to flood potential and its levies are subject to failure from seismic activity or high water. 
(2)  Impacts. The geologic conditions in San Joaquin County in general, and the City of Lodi, in particular, have the potential of restricting access to structures, especially in remote or isolated areas. A moderate earthquake or extended periods of rain can impact local access roads. 
(C)  Topographic. 
(1)  Conditions. The City of Lodi consists mainly of the San Joaquin Valley floor. The valley floor is typically flat land area bisected by intermittent and year round stream and river systems. Much of the valley floor is irrigated agriculture. Low land areas protected by a complex and extensive levee system characterize the Delta area. Union Pacific Railroad Tracks bisect the eastern and western portions of Lodi as well as Highway 99 creating traffic congestion and emergency response delays. 
(2)  Impacts. The valley floor is frequently subject to both general and localized flooding. Because the area is so flat and low, it is not unusual for local drainage systems to be inadequate during heavy rain periods. This condition can isolate areas where roads are flooded and thereby block access. With the OSHA "two-in two-out" rule requiring two fire fighters ready to make attack only when two others are present, the potential delay in east-west response increases the risk to firefighter and the public. 
While it is clearly understood that the adoption of such amendments may not prevent the incidence of fire, the implementation of these various amendments to the code attempt to reduce the severity and potential loss of life, property, and protection of the environment.

15.34.020 - Findings 
The city council, pursuant to Government Code Section 65863.6, finds and determines as follows: 
A.  San Joaquin County is one of the most rapidly growing areas in the state of California and the United States. Projections indicate such growth is likely to continue. 
B.  Experience has shown that rapid growth which occurs in the absence of a growth management plan produces negative impacts upon housing, traffic, parks, air quality, water, aesthetics, and the general quality of life of city residents. 
C.  The growth projections and policies established by this chapter reflect the estimated planned capacity of the city to serve new growth as it occurs. In doing so, the council has studied the existing and projected capacity of the city's wastewater and water systems, ability of city streets to handle further traffic, levels of police and fire protection, the necessity of providing schools, and other related data. 
D.  Rapid uncontrolled growth is also a direct cause of serious adverse environmental and economic effects, some of which are: 
1.  Loss of significant agricultural lands, including prime agricultural lands;

A.  By reference to the point system/criteria specified in Section 15.34.100 of this chapter, the project with the lowest number of points shall be eliminated from consideration until the number of unit applications remaining equals the number of building permits to be issued during that year. 
B.  During the elimination of projects under subsection A above, if two or more projects are tied for low score after all lower scores have been eliminated, the community development director shall reduce the number of units in each of the tied low-scoring projects, on an equal percentage basis, until the number remaining coincides with the number of building permits available. 
C.  No single project shall receive more than one-third of all single-family permits available in any single year, unless the number of applications received is less than permits available in that year.

Chapter 15.56 - ALARM SYSTEMS AND PERMITS[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1942, § 1, adopted May 17, 2017, repealed the former Ch. 15.56, §§ 15.56.01015.56.210, and enacted a new Ch. 15.56 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.56 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 1669 § 1 (part), adopted 1999. 
 
15.56.010 - Findings. 
A.  The city council finds and determines that the majority of alarms that police officers respond to are false alarms. 
B.  False alarms present a threat to the public health and safety by endangering police officers and the public by causing an emergency response to a non-emergency event and utilize valuable police services for non-emergency purposes. 
C.  False alarms are typically the result of user errors, service errors, faulty installation or service, and equipment failure. 
D.  The city council finds and declares that false alarms constitute a nuisance. 
E.  In enacting this chapter, the city council has been mindful of the preemptive effect of state law, in particular Business and Professions Code Sections 7590, et seq., and, in reliance upon Business and Professions Code Section 7592.8, this Chapter governs False Alarm activations and responses. 
F.  The city council finds that any regulatory fee established by this chapter is not a tax as that term is defined in subdivision (e) of Section 1 of Article XIIIC of the California Constitution (Proposition 26) because it is a charge for a specific benefit conferred directly to alarm users which is not provided to those not charged and which does not exceed the reasonable costs of conferring the benefit. Moreover, the regulatory fee established is a charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs incurred by the city in the enforcement of this chapter and fines and penalties are imposed as a result of a violation of law. 
(Ord. No. 1942, § 1, 5-17-2017)  
15.56.020 - Definitions. 
For the purpose of this chapter, certain words and phrases shall be construed in this chapter as set forth in this section unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended:

B.  "Alarm company operator" means any person who, for any consideration whatsoever, engages in business or accepts employment to install, maintain, alter, sell on premises, monitor, or service alarm systems or who responds to alarm systems except for any alarm agent. "Alarm company operator" includes any entity that is retained by a licensed alarm company operator, a customer, or any other person or entity, to monitor one or more alarm systems, whether or not the entity performs any other duties within the definition of an alarm company operator.

In a multi-unit building or complex, each unit shall be considered a separate alarm site, if served by a separate alarm system; in a single-unit building that houses two or more persons with separate alarm systems, each person's alarm system will be considered a separate alarm site.

Section: 
Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1829, § 1, adopted Mar. 17, 2010, repealed the former Ch. 15.60, Art. I, §§ 15.60.01015.60.110, Art. II, §§ 15.60.120, 15.60.130, Art. III, §§ 15.60.14015.60.180, Art. IV, §§ 15.60.190, 15.60.200, and enacted a new Ch. 15.60 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.60 pertained to flood damage prevention and derived from Ord. 1426 (part), 1988. 
 
Article I. - General Provisions 
 
15.60.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Lodi does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of Lodi are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare; and 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately-owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow], or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
7.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A.  "A zone" See "Special flood hazard area." 
B.  "Accessory structure" means a structure that is either: 
1.  Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or 
2.  A small, low-cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred twenty square feet. 
C.  "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
D.  "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration.

O.  "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 1, 1978. 
P.  "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
Q.  "Flood, flooding, or flood water" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
R.  "Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway.

"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
X.  "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in floodprone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
Y.  "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
Z.  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway."

BB.  "Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.60.240 and Section 15.60.250 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city of Lodi will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one-hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
CC.  "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
DD.  "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
EE.  "Hardship" as related to Section 15.60.240 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city of Lodi requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
FF.  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
GG.  "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the interior or directly by the secretary of the interior in states without approved programs. 
HH.  "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
II.  "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
JJ.  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.60.180(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.60.180(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.60.180(B); 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.60.190. 
KK.  "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
LL.  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
MM.  "Market value" is defined in the city of Lodi substantial damage/improvement procedures. See Section 15.60.130(B)(1). 
NN.  "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
OO.  "New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after April 16, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
PP.  "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 1, 1978. 
QQ.  "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation, or other material in, along, across, or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard, or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
RR.  "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
SS.  "Program deficiency" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. 
TT.  "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.60.240 and Section 15.60.250 of this chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
UU.  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
VV.  "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
WW.  "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damage, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
XX.  "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
YY.  "Sheet flow area." See "Area of shallow flooding." 
ZZ.  "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
AAA.  "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
BBB.  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
CCC.  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
DDD.  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
EEE.  "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
FFF.  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
GGG.  "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Lodi from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.090 - Abrogation and greater restrictions. 
This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.100 - Interpretation. 
In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be:

(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of city of Lodi, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
Article II. - Administration 
 
15.60.120 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The public works director is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.130 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Lodi; 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by city staff. 
C.  Review, Use, and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.60.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article III, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
c.  Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: 
Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Section 15.60.180(C)(1) and Section 15.60.210 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.60.180(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Section 15.60.180(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.60.200(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.60.230(B) (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.60.260. 
G.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.60.080. 
H.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)

(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.210 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to eighteen inches or more above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Subsection (A) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at eighteen inches or more above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.220 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed in Zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or

3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.60.140 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.60.210 (A). 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.230 - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Lodi. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Lodi shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Subsections (A) and (B) of this section are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
Article IV. - Variance Procedure 
 
15.60.240 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
The need to protect citizens from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
Variances may not be granted that would permit fraud and victimization of the public or that would present a threat to public safety or create a nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.250 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.60.12015.60.170, and Sections 15.60.18015.60.230 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.60.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city of Lodi need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city of Lodi believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the San Joaquin County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
15.60.260 - Appeals. 
The city council of the city of Lodi shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1829, § 1, 3-17-2010)  
Chapter 15.64 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT MITIGATION FEES[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1870, § 6, adopted February 20, 2013, repealed the former Ch. 15.64, §§ 15.64.01015.64.140, and enacted a new Ch. 15.64 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.64 pertained to development impact mitigation fees and derived from Ord. No. 1518, 1991; Ord. No. 1526, 1991; Ord. No. 1547, 1992; Ord. No. 1706, 2001; Ord. No. 1768, 2006 and Ord. No. 1832, adopted June 16, 2010. 
 
15.64.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The council finds and declares as follows: 
A.  In order to implement the goals of the city of Lodi's general plan and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, certain public improvements must be or had to be constructed. The city council determines that development impact mitigation fees are needed to finance these public improvements and to pay for new developments' fair share of the construction costs of these improvements. In establishing the fees described in this chapter, the city council finds the fees to be consistent with its general plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fees with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan. 
B.  The purpose of this chapter is to implement the general plan requirements set forth in this subsection and subsection A of this section and to impose mitigation fees to fund the cost of certain facilities, the demand for which is directly or indirectly generated by the type of new development proposed in the general plan, under the authority of: 
1.  The police power of the city granted under Article XI, Section 7, of the California Constitution; 
2.  The provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq., which in general requires that all developments mitigate environmental impacts; 
3.  The provisions of the California Government Code regarding general plans at Section 65300 et seq. including but not limited to the provisions of Government Code Section 65400. 
C.  It is further the purpose of this chapter to require that adequate provisions are made for developer-financed facilities and services within the city limits as a condition to the approval of a new development. 
D.  Development impact mitigation fees are established on development in the city. Development impact mitigation fees shall consist of separate fees as described in Section 15.64.030 of this chapter. The city council shall, by resolution, set forth the specific amount of the fees; describe the benefit and impact area on which the fee is imposed; refer to the specific improvements to be financed, their estimated cost and reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new developments; and set forth time for payment. Adoption of such fee resolutions shall be done in compliance with Government Code Sections 66016 et seq. 
E.  The specific improvements to be financed by the fee are described in the city of Lodi impact mitigation fee program prepared for the city by Harris and Associates, dated August, 2012, a copy of which is on file with the city clerk. The calculation of the fee is based upon the findings in the referenced study. 
F.  New development will generate new demand for facilities which must be accommodated by construction of new or expanded facilities. The amount of demand generated and, therefore, the benefit gained, varies according to kind of use. Therefore, a "dwelling unit equivalent" (DUE) factor that quantifies the facilities demand of different land use types in terms of their equivalence to a low density residential unit. A low density residential unit is assigned a DUE factor of 1.0 and the DUE factor for each of the other land use categories is determined based on the anticipated demand for each land use category relative to the anticipated demand for a low density residential unit. 
G.  The city has previously approved various development projects which have made significant financial expenditures towards completion, including the payment of the then current development impact mitigation fees; but have not obtained a building permit.

15.64.080 - Credit and reimbursement for construction of facilities. 
A.  Construction of Facilities in Advance of City of Lodi Development Impact Mitigation Fee Program (Fee Program). 
1.  The public works director may direct or authorize the owner to construct certain facilities specified in the city of Lodi development impact mitigation fee program (fee program), or portions thereof in advance of the fee program and as designated in the study, in lieu of all, or a portion of, the fee required by this chapter. The owner is entitled to a credit if the owner: (1) constructs the improvements, (2) finances an improvement by cash or other means approved by the council, or (3) a combination of the above. The credit to be provided to the property owner shall be determined by the public works director based on prevailing construction costs plus ten percent for engineering and administration and shall be approved by the council. The construction of a facility authorized by this section must consist of a usable facility or segment and be approved by the city and constructed in accordance with the city's public improvement design standards. The property owner must post a bond or other security in a form acceptable to the director for the complete performance of the construction before credit is given. 
2.  If the amount of credit is less than the amount of the otherwise applicable fee, the property owner shall pay the amount which, when added to the credit received for the construction of facilities, equals the fee obligation. 
3.  If the amount of credit is greater than the amount of the otherwise applicable development impact mitigation fee, the property owner shall be paid the difference only from the appropriate development impact mitigation fee fund, after the project is accepted by the city. 
4.  If the development impact fee funds responsible for the reimbursement do not have adequate balances to fund the credit, the city and the developer shall enter into a reimbursement agreement. In addition to its other terms, the agreement shall provide that: 
a.  The general fund of the city is not liable for payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; 
b.  The credit or taxing power of the city is not pledged for the payment of any obligations arising from the agreement; 
c.  The land owner shall not compel the exercise of the city taxing power or the forfeiture of any of its property to satisfy any obligations arising from the agreement; 
d.  The obligation arising from the agreement is not a debt of the city, nor a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance, upon any of its property, or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, and is payable only from the fees deposited in the appropriate city development impact mitigation fee fund; 
e.  The reimbursable amount shall be increased annually to include an amount attributable to interest. This amount shall be based on the change in the Engineering News Record 20 Cities Construction Cost Index from the January 1st index of the year of construction to the January 1st index of the year of reimbursement. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.090 - Other authority. 
This chapter is intended to establish a supplemental method for funding the cost of certain facilities and services, the demand for which will be generated by the level and type of development proposed in the city general plan. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to limit the power of the city council to impose any other fees or exactions or to continue to impose existing ones on development within the city, but shall be in addition to any other requirements which the city council is authorized to impose, or has previously imposed, as a condition of approving a plan, rezoning or other entitlement within the city. In particular, individual property owners shall remain obligated to fund, construct, and/or dedicate the improvements, public facilities and other exactions required by, but not limited to, the city code, public improvement design standards and other applicable documents. Any credits or reimbursements under Section 15.64.080 shall not include the funding, construction, or dedications described in this section. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.100 - Findings regarding use of fees. 
A.  As required under Government Code Section 66001(d), the city shall make findings once each fiscal year with respect to any portion of the fee remaining unexpended or uncommitted in its account five or more years after deposit of the fee, to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put and demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged. 
B.  As required under Government Code Section 66001(e), the city shall refund to the current record owner on a prorated basis the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be established. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.110 - Fee exemptions. 
The following developments are exempt from payment of fees described in this chapter: 
A.  City projects; 
B.  Projects constructed or financed under this chapter; 
C.  Reconstruction of, or residential additions to single-family dwellings, but not including additional dwelling units; 
D.  Property which has paid a master storm drain fee pursuant to Resolution 3618 or Ordinance No. 1440 is exempt from payment of the storm drainage impact fee except for changes in land use as described in the fee resolution. 
E.  Additional exemption for development projects in progress: 
1.  A project on a parcel (or portion of a parcel) which has, on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, received the appropriate development approval, but has not obtained a building permit and has paid appropriate mitigation fees under Resolution 3618 or Ordinance 1440, shall be exempt from imposition of the development impact mitigation fees imposed under this chapter except the sewer lift station area fees. 
2.  For purposes of this subsection, "appropriate development approval" shall include: 
a.  An approved or conditionally approved tentative map; 
b.  An approved final subdivision or parcel map; 
c.  An approved use permit when no map was required; 
d.  An approved public improvement agreement. 
3.  The exemption under this subsection shall not apply to changes in land use, pursuant to subsection D of this section for storm drainage impact fees. 
4.  The exemption under this subsection shall apply on projects which include a change in land use to a more intensive use as defined in this chapter only to the extent that the previously approved land use shall be considered an existing use and the project shall be charged the appropriate incremental increase as provided in this chapter and the fee resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.120 - Fee adjustment or waiver. 
A.  The owner of a project subject to a fee under this chapter may apply to the public works director for an adjustment to or waiver of that fee. The waiver of this fee shall be based on the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impact on public facilities of that development and either the amount of fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. 
B.  The application for adjustment or waiver shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk no later than ten days after formal notification of the fee to be charged. The application shall state in detail the factual basis and legal theory for the claim of adjustment or waiver. 
C.  It is the intent of this chapter that: 
1.  The land use categories are based on general plan designations which are an average of a wide range of specific land uses; thus substantial variation must be shown in order to justify a fee adjustment; 
2.  The public works director may calculate a fee and/or require additional improvements where the service demand of a particular land use exceeds the standards shown in the definitions or used in determining the improvements needed under the fee program; 
3.  The fee categories shall be considered individually; thus it may occur that a fee adjustment or waiver is made in one category and not another; and 
4.  Where improvements providing capacity for the subject parcel have already been constructed, a downward adjustment of the fee is not appropriate. 
D.  The public works director shall consider the application at an informal hearing held within sixty days after the filing of the fee adjustment or waiver application. The decision of the public works director is appealable pursuant to Section 15.64.130. 
E.  The applicant bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the application. The public works director shall consider the following factors in its determination whether or not to approve a fee adjustment or waiver: 
1.  The factors identified in Section 66001: 
a.  The purpose and proposed uses of the fee, 
b.  The type of development, 
c.  The relationship between the fee's use and type of development, 
d.  The need for improvements and the type of development, and 
e.  The amount of the fee and the portion of it attributable to the development; and 
2.  The substance and nature of the evidence including the development impact fee study and the applicant's technical data supporting its request. The applicant must present comparable technical information to show that the fee is inappropriate for the particular development. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.130 - Appeal procedure. 
A.  The public works director is responsible for administering, collecting, crediting, adjusting, and refunding development fees. A decision by the public works director regarding a fee imposed under this chapter is appealable in accordance with this section. A person seeking judicial review shall first seek an appeal under this section. 
B  A person appealing a decision under this chapter shall file a request with the public works director who is responsible for processing the appeal. The appeal shall be in writing, stating the factual and legal grounds, and shall be filed within ten calendar days following the decision of the public works director being appealed. 
C.  The public works director shall notify the city manager of the appeal. The city manager shall set the matter for hearing before the city council and notify the person appealing in writing of the time and place. 
D.  The city council shall conduct the hearing, prepare written findings of fact and a written decision on the matter, and shall preserve the complete administrative record of the proceeding. The council shall consider all relevant evidence presented by the appellant, the public works director or other interested party. 
E.  The decision of the city council is final; it is reviewable by a court under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. 
F.  The city adopts the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 1094.5, for the purposes of judicial review under this section. A petition seeking review of a decision under this chapter shall be filed not later than the ninetieth day following the date on which the decision of the hearing officer becomes final. 
(Ord. No. 1870, § 6, 2-20-2013)  
15.64.140 - Severability. 
If any provision or clause of the ordinance codified in this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held to be unconstitutional or to be otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect other ordinance provisions or clauses or applications thereof which can be implemented without the invalid provision or clause or application, and to this end the provisions and clauses of the ordinance codified in this chapter are declared to be severable.

Chapter 15.65 - SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE[11] 

Footnotes: 
--- (11) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1907, § 1, adopted August 5, 2015, repealed the former Chapter 15.65, §§ 15.65.01015.65.070, and enacted a new Chapter 15.65 as set out herein. The former Chapter 15.65 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1767, 2005). 
 
15.65.010 - Purpose, findings, and declaration of intent. 
A.  In order to implement the goals and objectives of the general plan and to mitigate impacts caused by new development with the County of San Joaquin, a regional transportation impact fee program is necessary. The program is needed to finance regional-serving transportation and transit improvements. 
B.  Substantial population and employment growth is expected in San Joaquin County through 2025 and beyond. This growth will cause impacts on the regional transportation network ("regional transportation network" or "RTIF network") including increased congestion and related impacts unless substantial improvements are completed. The regional transportation impact fee program ("RTIF program") is intended to impose a fee to provide funding for transportation and transit improvements that help mitigate these impacts. 
C.  New development throughout the county will be subject to the fee which will be proportional to the impact caused on the regional transportation network by such new development. 
D.  The funding derived from the RTIF program shall be used in combination with other funding available to complete the needed transportation and transit improvements. In the absence of an RTIF program, existing funding sources, including federal, state, and local sources, will be inadequate to construct the regional transportation network required to avoid the unacceptable levels of traffic congestion and related adverse impacts.

15.66.010 - Purpose, findings, and declaration of intent. 
A.  In order to implement the goals and objectives of the general plan and to mitigate impacts caused by new development within the county of San Joaquin, a county facilities fee program is necessary. The program is needed to finance region-serving capital facilities located throughout the county that are used by the residents and businesses within the city and to assure that new development pays its proportional share for these improvements. 
B.  Fee revenue collected pursuant to this chapter shall be remitted to the county of San Joaquin who shall be responsible for administering the fee funds and constructing the capital facilities. 
C.  Title 7, Division 1, Chapter 5, Section 66000 et seq. of the California Government Code provides that capital facilities fees may be enacted and imposed on development projects. The city council finds and determines that: 
1.  New development projects cause the need for construction, expansion, or improvement of capital facilities within the county of San Joaquin. 
2.  Funds for construction, expansion, or improvement of capital facilities are not available to accommodate demand for service caused by development projects; which results in inadequate capital facilities within San Joaquin County. 
D.  The city council finds that the health, safety, peace, morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity, and general welfare of the residents and businesses within the city will be promoted by the adoption of county facilities fees for construction, expansion, or improvement of region-serving capital facilities.

Chapter 15.68 - SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY MULTI-SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE PLAN (SJMSCP) DEVELOPMENT FEES 
Sections: 
 
15.68.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  In order to implement the goals and objectives of the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Habitat Conservation and Open Space Plan (SJMSCP), and to mitigate the cumulative impacts of new development on undeveloped lands within the city of Lodi and in San Joaquin County, the establishment of preserve lands will be necessary to compensate for impacts to threatened, endangered, rare and unlisted SJMSCP covered species and other wildlife, and compensation for some non-wildlife related impacts to recreation, agriculture, scenic values and other beneficial open space uses. 
B.  In accordance with Sections 7.3, 7.4.1, 7.4.1.1, 7.4.1.3, and 7.4.1.4 of the SJMSCP, new development will pay approximately sixty percent of total SJMSCP costs with the exception of vernal pool conversions that will pay one hundred percent of total SJMSCP costs. While those undertaking new development pursuant to the SJMSCP may opt to dedicate lands consistent with the SJMSCP preserve designs or to purchase credits from mitigation banks, most of the sixty percent contribution to the SJMSCP costs from new development will be in the form of development fees. 
C.  The Lodi city council is required to establish a fee ordinance in accordance with Section 5.1.1.(b) of the SJMSCP Implementation Agreement for the purpose of collecting fee monies to finance the SJMSCP. In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the Lodi city council has found the fee to be consistent with the SJMSCP Funding Plan as provided in Chapter 7 of the SJMSCP. 
(Ord. 1707 § 1 (part), 2001)  
15.68.020 - SJMSCP development fee. 
A.  Establishment of Fee. The SJMSCP development fee (hereinafter, the fee) is hereby established for new development pursuant to the SJMSCP in the city of Lodi to pay for preserve lands to mitigate the cumulative impacts related to new development, including but not limited to acquisition, enhancement, restoration, maintenance and/or operation of habitat/open space conservation lands. The fee shall not be collected until the city of Lodi, in a council resolution: 
1.  Sets forth the purpose of the fee; 
2.  Identifies the specific use(s) to be financed; 
3.  Describes how there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the type of development project; 
4.  Determines how there is a reasonable relationship between the need for use(s) and type(s) of development project(s); 
5.  Determines the amount of the fee and how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the preserve lands or portion thereof attributable to the development; and 
6.  Establishes a separate development fee account into which the fees shall be placed, provides for the appropriation of the fees, and references the proposed transfer of fees to SJCOG, Inc. (a.k.a. JPA as per the SJMSCP). 
B.  Annual Adjustment. The fee established pursuant to a resolution shall be adjusted each year by an amount consistent with the California Construction Cost Index (CCCI) as published by the Engineering News Record and/or in conformance with Section 7.5.2.2. of the SJMSCP, and as approved by SJCOG, Inc. 
The proposed fee adjustments shall be adopted by the city council in order to be effective by January 1 of each year. 
C.  Interest. The fees collected shall earn interest while in possession of the city of Lodi. The interest earned shall be credited to the account in which the fee was deposited and shall be retained by the city of Lodi until transferred to the SJCOG, Inc. account. 
D.  Payment of Fees. The fee shall be collected in accordance with Chapter 5.3.2.3 of the SJMSCP. 
E.  Use of Fee or Refund. The chief financial officer of SJCOG, Inc. shall make findings once each fiscal year with respect to any portion of any moneys, excluding letters of credit or other security instruments, that is remaining unexpended or uncommitted in the SJCOG, Inc. account for five or more years after deposit of the fee, to identify the purpose to which the fee is to be put, and to demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged. 
There shall be refunded to the then current record owner or owners of the parcels of the development project or projects on a prorated basis the unexpended or uncommitted portion of the fee, and any interest accrued thereon, for which need cannot be demonstrated pursuant to this subdivision. The refund shall be made from the unexpended or uncommitted revenues by direct payment, or by any other means consistent with the intent of this section. If the administrative costs of refunding unexpended or uncommitted revenues pursuant to this section exceed the amount to be refunded, the SJCOG, Inc. board of directors, after a public hearing, may determine the revenues shall be allocated for some other purpose for which the fees are collected subject to this chapter and which serves the project on which the fee was originally imposed. 
(Ord. 1707 § 1 (part), 2001) 
(Ord. No. 1825, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
15.68.030 - Use of fees. 
A.  The fees paid shall be placed in a separate fee account to avoid commingling of the fees with other funds of the city of Lodi. The fees may be temporarily invested. Such fees, along with any interest earnings, shall be used solely to pay for those uses(s) described in the Resolution enacted pursuant to Section 15.68.020, which shall include the following: 
1.  To pay for acquisition of preserve lands (and associated transaction costs);

Chapter 17.16 - APPLICABILITY AND GENERAL DESIGN GUIDELINES 
 
17.16.010 - Purpose of design guidelines. 
The design guidelines in this article are intended as a guide to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the city's goals for attaining high quality development that is sensitive to the city's unique character. The guidelines will be used by staff and the site plan and architectural review committee (SPARC) during the design review process, and by the commission in the review of land use permit applications. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.16.020 - Applicability. 
A.  The design guidelines in this article apply to all development within the city. The design elements of each project (including site design, architecture, landscaping, signs, parking design) will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis. 
B.  The review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.16.030 - General design guidelines. 
This section provides general design guidelines and principles that are applicable to all development within the city. 
A.  Consider Adjacent Development. Each development proposal should demonstrate consideration for the context of the proposed project on and off the site including the following: 
1.  Land uses and site organization of neighboring properties; 
2.  The architectural style and building forms of neighboring structures; 
3.  Existing natural features (i.e., mature trees, etc.); 
4.  Privacy on the site and neighboring properties; and 
5.  Links to adjacent development using sidewalks and shared access drives and parking. 
B.  Landscaping. 
1.  Landscaped areas should be planned as an integral part of the overall project and not simply located in "left over" areas of the site. 
2.  Landscaping should be used to help define outdoor spaces, soften a structure's appearance, and to screen parking, loading, storage, and equipment areas. 
3.  The use of on-site pedestrian amenities (e.g., benches, shelters, drinking fountains, lighting, and trash receptacles) is encouraged. These elements should be provided in conjunction with on-site open spaces and be integrated into the site plan as primary features. 
C.  Exterior Lighting. Exterior lighting should be designed to be compatible with the architectural and landscape design of the project. 
1.  An appropriate hierarchy of lighting fixtures/structures and intensity should be considered when designing the lighting for the various elements of a project (i.e., building and site entrances, walkways, parking areas, or other areas of the site). 
2.  The use of exterior lighting to accent a building's architecture is encouraged. All lighting fixtures should be properly shielded to eliminate light and glare from impacting adjacent properties, and passing vehicles or pedestrians. If neon tubing is used to illuminate portions of a building it should be concealed from view through the use of parapets, cornices or ledges. Small portions of exposed neon tubing may be used to add a special effect to a building's architecture but this must be well thought out and integrated into the overall design of the project. 
3.  To achieve the desired lighting level for parking and pedestrian areas, the use of more short, low intensity fixtures is encouraged over the use of a few tall fixtures that illuminate large areas. 
D.  Screening. 
1.  Screening is a technique used to protect and separate uses and site functions from one another for the purpose of decreasing adverse noise, wind, or visual impacts and to provide privacy. The need for screening should be considered early in the design process so that screening elements (e.g., walls, fences, berms, landscaping) can be effectively integrated into the overall project design and not added later as an afterthought. 
2.  The method of screening should be compatible with the adjacent structure in terms of overall design, materials, and color. 
3.  Where screening is required at the ground level, a combination of elements should be considered including solid masonry walls, wood fences, berms, and landscaping. 
E.  Refuse, Storage, and Equipment Areas. 
1.  Refuse containers, service areas, loading docks, and similar facilities should be located in areas out of view from the general public and so that their use does not interfere with on-site parking or circulation areas, and adjacent uses, especially residential uses. 
  
Figure 2-7 - Trash Enclosure Location 
2.  Trash bins shall be fully enclosed. Enclosures should be screened with landscaping on their most visible sides. Recommended locations include inside parking courts or at the end of parking bays. Locations should be conveniently accessible for trash collection and maintenance and should not block access driveway during loading operations. 
3.  Trash storage areas that are visible from the upper stories of adjacent structures should have an opaque or semi-opaque horizontal cover/screen to mitigate unsightly views. The covering structure should be compatible with the site's architectural style. 
4.  All screening facilities should be of adequate size for their intended purpose without dominating the site, blocking sight distances, or creating unnecessary barriers. 
F.  General Building Design Guidelines. 
1.  Compatibility With Context. New buildings should be in proportion to surrounding buildings, except in those cases where current buildings are oversize. Harmony in mass, lines, and materials is important but monotony should be avoided. Buildings should be designed so that adverse impacts on adjacent buildings and properties are minimized. Loss of natural lighting, shade trees, noise pollution, and exhaust fumes and heat from venting should be addressed during project review, and all possible efforts should be made to avoid these effects. 
2.  Facade Design. Building facades should be designed to provide visual interest and relief. Continuous street facades, as near the street as possible with predominantly retail uses at grade and office/professional uses above, are encouraged. Buildings should not be overpowering or monotonous. A change in the planes of walls or variety in the roof form provides diversity and visual interest. 
3.  Building Materials. 
a.  Artificial or decorative facade treatments, where one or more unrelated materials appear to be simply applied to the surface of a building rather than an integral part of its design, should be avoided. Materials should be used honestly. Artificial products that attempt to imitate real materials (for example, wood, stone, brick, etc.) are discouraged. 
b.  The composition of materials should avoid creating the impression of thinness and artificiality. Veneers should turn corners, avoiding exposed edges. 
  
Figure 2-8 - Building Material at Wall Edges 
c.  Natural building materials (e.g., wood, stone, and brick) that blend with the natural surroundings should be used. Other materials should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Buildings should minimize the use of large expanses of reflective glazing, aluminum panels, and other materials not normally found in Lodi. Synthetic materials that attempt to simulate the textures or patterns of other materials (e.g., vinyl siding that attempts to simulate the pattern of woodgrain) should not be used. 
4.  Colors. 
a.  Colors should be compatible with the existing colors of the surrounding area but need not duplicate existing colors. The use of muted tones for the structure's base color is recommended. Color should not be used as an attention getting device. 
b.  Accent colors should be used carefully and be complementary to the base color or a variation of its hue, either weaker or stronger. 
c.  The transition between base and accent colors should relate to changes in building materials or the change of building surface planes. Colors should generally not meet or change without some physical change or definition to the surface plane. 
d.  In most cases, only one or two accent colors should be used in addition to the base color. 
G.  Subdivisions. Subdivisions of commercial, industrial, and multi-family residential properties should be designed to allow coordinated development of the parcels, facilitate shared parking and common driveways, reduce encroachments onto public and private streets, and promote pedestrian activity. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
Chapter 17.18 - RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
17.18.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the residential zoning districts established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established). It also determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides general standards for site development. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.18.020 - Purposes of residential zoning districts. 
The residential zoning districts are intended to provide for a range of housing types and densities for all economic segments of the community while emphasizing high quality development and home ownership (general plan, housing element). The purposes of the individual residential zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: 
A.  RLD (Low-Density Residential) District. The RLD zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for the development of single-family detached, two-family, and three-family homes. All interior lots are restricted to single-family homes. Corner lots can have one-, two-, or three-family homes. The maximum allowable residential density is 8.0 dwelling units per acre. The RLD zoning district is consistent with the low-density residential land use designation of the general plan. 
B.  RMD (Medium Density Residential) District. The RMD zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for a mix of housing types. Typical residential land uses include single- and multi-family dwelling units, either attached or detached. The maximum allowable residential density ranges from 8.1 to twenty dwelling units per acre. The RMD zoning district is consistent with the medium density residential land use designation of the general plan. 
C.  RHD (High Density Residential) District. The RHD zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for high density multi-family dwelling units. The maximum allowable residential density ranges from fifteen to thirty-five units per acre. The RHD zoning district is consistent with the high density residential land use designation of the general plan. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.18.030 - Residential zoning district land uses and permit requirements. 
Table 2-4 identifies the uses of land allowed by this development code in each residential zoning district, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 17.12.030 (Allowable Land Users and Permit Requirements). 
Note: Where the last column in the tables ("Specific Use Regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use; however, provisions in other sections of this development code may also apply.

(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.18.050 - Residential design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose of Chapter. The design character of Lodi's residential neighborhoods is as diverse as the different time periods during which they were developed. The guidelines provided here are intended to assist project designers and property owners in understanding and implementing the city's goals for attaining high quality residential development. They are also intended to help preserve the traditional character of the city's older neighborhoods. 
These guidelines are intended to encourage well designed residential neighborhoods that people enjoy living in, which: reduce the visual dominance of the automobile; promote pedestrian activity; create variety and interest in the appearance of residential streets; provide community open space; and protect significant features of the natural environment. 
B.  Applicability. These guidelines apply to the design of new residential subdivisions and to multi-family and clustered residential projects. Guidelines are also provided for vacant infill parcels and single-family homes that are proposed as replacement structures within established neighborhoods. See also Section 17.16.020 (Applicability). 
C.  Subdivision Design and General Residential Project Principles. The following guidelines apply to new residential subdivisions, and address how new residential subdivisions should relate to their surroundings: 
1.  Develop "Neighborhoods." Each new residential project should be designed to integrate with the surrounding neighborhood to ensure that it maintains the established character. Subdivisions in city expansion areas should be designed so that individual, separately developed projects work together to create distinct neighborhoods, instead of disjointed or isolated enclaves. 
2.  Integrate Open Space. New subdivisions adjacent to planned or existing parks or other public open spaces (e.g., creeks, riparian areas), or the landscaped grounds of schools or other public facilities should maximize visibility and pedestrian access to these areas. Where these facilities are not already planned, the subdivision should be designed to provide usable public open spaces in the form of parks, linear bicycle and pedestrian trails, squares, and greens, as appropriate. 
3.  Edges. "Gated communities," and other residential developments designed to appear as continuous walled-off areas, disconnected and isolated from the rest of the community, are strongly discouraged. While walls and fences may be useful for security, sound attenuation and privacy, these objectives can often be met by creative design that controls the height and length of walls, develops breaks and variations in relief, and uses landscaping for screening. 
4.  Scale. New residential subdivisions, and groups of subdivisions that, in effect, collectively create a new neighborhood, should be designed to provide a "walkable" scale, that places all homes within one-quarter mile of neighborhood shopping opportunities, a neighborhood park, or a public facility that can serve as a "center" for the neighborhood. Ideally, each neighborhood should have a center that includes all three facilities. 
5.  Site planning. Residential subdivision and multi-family project site planning should emphasize the needs of pedestrians and cyclists rather than cars 
a.  Street Layout. New public streets and sidewalks should be aligned with, and be connected to those of adjacent developments to interconnect the community. 
i.  Pedestrian orientation. Subdivision design should emphasize pedestrian connectivity within each project, to adjacent neighborhoods, nearby schools and parks, and to transit stops within one-quarter-mile of planned residential areas. All streets and walkways should be designed to provide safe and pleasant conditions for pedestrians, including the disabled, and cyclists. 
ii.  Block Length. The length of block faces between intersecting streets should be as short as possible, ideally no more than four hundred feet, to provide pedestrian connectivity. 
iii.  Street Width and Design Speed. Streets within neighborhoods should be no wider than needed to accommodate parking and two low-speed travel lanes. Streets in new subdivisions should be designed to accommodate traffic speeds of twenty-five miles per hour or less, with most streets in a subdivision designed for lower speeds. 
iv.  Parkway/Planting Strips. Sidewalks should be separated from curbs by parkway strips of at least five feet in width. The parkways should be planted with canopy trees at a twenty-foot interval, or as appropriate to the species of the selected street tree, to produce a continuously shaded sidewalk. The parkways should also be planted with ground covers and other plant materials that will withstand pedestrian traffic. 
v.  Access to Open Areas. Single-loaded streets (those with residential development on one side and open space on the other) should be used to provide public access to, and visibility of natural open spaces, public parks, and neighborhood schools, as well as a means for buffering homes from parks and schools. 
Where single-loaded streets are not feasible or desirable, other methods that provide similar access and visibility may be used, including private streets, bike and pedestrian paths, or the placement of private common open space or recreation facilities adjacent to the public open space. 
vi.  Cul-de-sac Streets. The use of cul-de-sac streets should be avoided wherever possible. If cul-de-sacs are necessary, the end of each cul-de-sac should provide a pedestrian walkway and bikeway between private parcels to link with an adjacent cul-de-sac, street, and/or park, school, or open space area. 
vii.  Alleys. Alleys may be provided for garage access, otherwise individual lots should be wide enough to accommodate a side yard driveway to a detached garage at the rear of the lot, so that appearance of the street frontage is not dominated by garages and pavement. 
b.  Open Space and Natural Features. Providing open space and integrating natural features into a residential project can significantly increase the appreciation of residents in their neighborhoods, provide safe places for children and families to play, and maintain a strong sense of connection with the surrounding natural environment in the city as a whole. 
i.  Natural amenities (such as views, mature trees, creeks, riparian corridors, and similar features) should be preserved and incorporated into proposed development to the greatest extent feasible. 
ii.  Development adjacent to parks or other public open spaces should be designed to provide maximum visibility of these areas. 
6.  Exterior Finish Materials. Exterior finish materials should be durable and require low maintenance. The use of combined materials (such as stucco and wood siding) can provide visual interest and texture; however, all sides of each single-family dwelling or multi-family structure should employ the same materials, design details, and window treatment. Each residential structure should have a carefully designed and detailed facade facing the street, and should not use bland, featureless stucco or other simple materials on the other exterior building walls. Each residential structure should look like the same building from all sides. 
7.  Windows. Where one or more windows are proposed ten feet or less from a side lot line, or within ten feet of another dwelling, the windows should be located and/or screened to provide privacy for the residents of both structures. In some cases, glass block or translucent glass may be appropriate to provide light, but also provide privacy between buildings. 
8.  Garages and Carports. Accommodating vehicle storage in both single-family dwellings and multi-family projects should avoid the common problem of creating streets that appear garage- and driveway-dominated. 
a.  In the limited instances where an exception is granted for a setback to a garage of less than twenty feet from a property line or internal driveway, the garage shall be equipped with a roll-up door. This requirement is intended to discourage vehicles from parking in front of garages and blocking the adjacent driveway or sidewalk. 
b.  Where carports are provided, they may be bordered by patio walls, or used to define public and private open space, but should not be located adjacent to perimeter streets. Each carport end should be screened by a low wall, berm, and/or landscaping. 
c.  Where multiple garages are located together, landscaped tree wells should be placed between every two garage doors. Each tree well should be a minimum of twenty-five square feet. 
d.  Carports and detached garages should be designed as an integral part of a project. Their materials, color, and details should be the same as the principal structures. Carports may have flat roofs but should not project above the exterior walls of any buildings adjacent to streets. Prefabricated metal or canvas tent-like carports are not acceptable. Where garages are utilized, doors should appear set into walls rather than flush with the exterior wall. 
e.  The use of quality materials, windows, and features with horizontal and vertical relief are encouraged to add interest and character to the design of garage doors and to coordinate their design with the architecture of the primary residence. 
D.  Infill Development. The following guidelines apply to "infill development." That is, multi-family structures or individual houses that entirely replace existing units or are constructed on vacant parcels between existing units. The guidelines are intended to provide for infill projects of high architectural quality that are compatible with existing development. They are also intended to promote the conservation and reuse of existing older houses, and to preserve the historical character of the city's older neighborhoods. Preservation and rehabilitation efforts in the older neighborhoods should protect the architectural features of a home that identify its individual style and contribute to the character of the area: 
1.  General Principles. Infill residential development should: 
a.  Be compatible in scale, siting, detailing, and overall character with adjacent buildings and those in the immediate neighborhood. This is crucial when a new or remodeled house is proposed to be larger than others in the neighborhood. When new homes are developed adjacent to older ones, the height and bulk of the new construction can have a negative impact on adjacent, smaller scale buildings. 
b.  Continue existing neighborhood patterns. For example, patterns such as front porches and entries facing the street, finished floor height, and garages located at the rear of lots. 
2.  Building Design. An infill residential structure should incorporate the traditional architectural characteristics of existing houses in the neighborhood, including window and door spacing, exterior materials, roof style and pitch, ornamentation and other details. 
3.  Visual Impacts from Building Height. The height of infill projects should be consistent with surrounding residential structures. Where greater height is desired, an infill structure should set back upper floors from the edge of the first story to reduce impacts on adjacent smaller homes, and to protect solar access. See Figure 2-9. 
  
Figure 2-9 - Appropriate Infill Building Massing 
4.  Outdoor Living Areas. The use of balconies, verandas, porches, and courtyards within the building form of infill structures is strongly encouraged. 
5.  Exterior Finish Materials. The thoughtful selection of building materials can enhance desired neighborhood qualities such as compatibility, continuity, and harmony. The design of infill residential structures should incorporate an appropriate mixture of the predominant materials found in the neighborhood. Common materials in Lodi are smooth, troweled, or sand-finished stucco, wood, horizontal clapboard siding, brick, and stone. 
6.  Exterior Colors. Color schemes for infill residential structures should consider the colors of existing houses in the neighborhood, to maintain compatibility. 
E.  Single-Family Housing Design (Including Additions/Renovations). 
1.  Houses in New Subdivisions. The site planning of lots and the design of houses constructed in new subdivisions should help create neighborhoods that are oriented more toward pedestrians than automobiles. Subdivisions of new homes should comply with the following guidelines: 
a.  Subdivisions should provide variety in the architectural detailing, size, and massing of houses on each block. 
b.  Houses should be located no further from the street than the minimum setback allowed by the applicable zoning district, except to provide variations in the alignment of houses along a block. 
c.  All houses should have their primary entrance facing and clearly visible from the street, with a front porch or verandah encouraged to provide a transition between the public space of the streetscape and the indoor private space of the house. 
d.  When viewed from the street, a garage should be visually subordinate to the living space within the house that addresses the street. Ideally, a garage should be detached from the house, located at the rear of the lot, and accessed by an alley, or a shared driveway from the street fronting the lot. Where this arrangement is not appropriate, the front of an attached garage should be set back from the front of the house (at least fifteen feet is recommended where the lot area permits). 
2.  Infill Development. New single-family homes proposed on infill lots should comply with the guidelines for infill residential development in Section 17.18.050(D) (Infill Development). 
3.  Additions and Alterations in Older Neighborhoods. The following guidelines apply to additions and the rehabilitation, remodeling, or alteration of existing single-family houses in Lodi's older neighborhoods. While these guidelines apply to all houses, those that are designated as cultural resources may be subject to more strict standards. 
a.  Additions. Additions to residential structures built before 1950 should respect the architectural style, detailing, scale, and composition of the original building so that they look integrated with the original structure, rather than a tacked-on afterthought. Modifications (e.g., additions, seismic strengthening, replacement of windows or siding material, and new entrances) should not compromise the integrity of historically authentic features, materials, or finishes. Additions should also be designed with consideration for the design and massing of adjacent residences, to promote neighborhood compatibility. See Figure 2-10. 
  
Figure 2-10 - Additions to Existing Homes 
i.  Roof Changes. The roof features of a residential structure, especially its style, materials and pitch, are important architectural elements that must be considered when planning an addition. The roof style, pitch and materials on the addition should match the original. 
ii.  Additional Floors. Adding a story to an existing house will change the building proportions and should be carefully designed to follow similar multi-story examples of the particular architectural style found in the neighborhood. In some cases, integrating the new story addition may require that it be set back or "stepped" back from the front facade so that it is less noticeable from the street. 
b.  AlterationsRestoration and Remodeling. The rehabilitation of older buildings should aim to retain and restore their original elements. If damage or deterioration is too severe, the element should be recreated using original materials to match the design, color, texture and any other important design features. See Figure 2-11. 
  
Figure 2-11 - Remodeling Features 
When replacement is necessary and materials similar to or consistent with original materials cannot be obtained, substitute materials should incorporate design, colors and textures that convey the traditional appearance of the original material. 
c.  Exterior Materials. Original exterior building materials should be retained whenever possible. Mismatched materials of different sizes, shapes, textures, or finishes should be avoided. 
i.  Wood Siding. Residential buildings with original wood clapboard siding should not be stuccoed in an attempt to "modernize" their appearance. 
ii.  Brick Surfaces. Brick surfaces should not be sandblasted to remove old paint, nor should they be covered with stucco or other siding materials. Sandblasting will damage the natural fired surface of the brick and cause it to lose its water repellent qualities. Paint should be removed by chemical stripping. Brick that was not intended to be painted as part of a building's original design should not be painted over. 
d.  Windows. Most older residential structures have wood-framed windows that are either fixed, double hung, or casement. Window replacements or additions should also use the original type of window. It is strongly recommended that aluminum frame windows not be used as replacements in any residential structure unless they were part of the original design. See Figure 2-12. 
  
Figure 2-12 - Window Types and Treatments 
e.  Doors. Many of Lodi's older homes have solid wood doors consistent with the particular architectural style of the building. The front door is typically the most ornate, with secondary doors usually more utilitarian in appearance. The size, shape and style of doors is an important feature of all historical architectural styles, and the original type and design should continue to be used. See Figure 2-13. 
  
Figure 2-13 - Door Features 
If the original door is missing, an appropriate design should be selected through the study of the doors of similar residential structures in the neighborhood, or by consulting books on architectural styles. Some older-style panel doors can be obtained from material suppliers, and may closely match original doors. 
f.  Porches and Stairs. During rehabilitation efforts, the design integrity of the front porch should be maintained. The installation of wrought iron or aluminum railings should be avoided, as a change in the structural or decorative elements of the front porch will usually compromise the architectural integrity of the entire building. Restoring an older building's architectural integrity may require "undoing" previous porch alterations. See Figures 2-14 and 2-15. 
  
Figure 2-14 - Appropriate Porch Stairway Designs 
  
Figure 2-15 - Inappropriate Porch Stairway Designs 
g.  Ornamentation and Trim. The authentic decoration and trim of a residential structure lends character and identifies the building with a particular architectural style. Care should be taken in handling these materials during renovation because they are critical components. 
h.  Roofs. Care should be taken to ensure that roofing materials are compatible with the original style of the structure. 
F.  Multi-Family and Clustered Housing Design. Multi-family and clustered housing projects are generally more dense than single-family developments, and tend to generate larger parking areas and provide less private open space. If not properly designed, parking can dominate a site, and open space may only be provided as "left over" areas, unrelated to other project features, not usable for outdoor activities, and that expose residents to uncomfortable noise levels. Multi-family projects surrounded by high walls, parking lots and/or rows of carports along streets are inappropriate in Lodi and should be avoided. These guidelines address higher density developments through appropriate guidelines for site planning, parking and circulation layout, building design, and landscaping. 
1.  Site Planning. Site planning for a multi-family or clustered housing project should create a pleasant, comfortable, safe, and distinct place for residents, without the project "turning its back" on the surrounding neighborhood 
a.  The placement of new units should consider the existing character of the surrounding residential area. New development should respect the privacy of adjacent residential uses through appropriate building orientation and structure height, so that windows do not overlook and impair the privacy of the indoor or outdoor living space of adjacent units. 
b.  Multi-family units should be clustered. A project of more than ten units outside the Downtown should separate the units into structures of six or fewer units. See Figure 2-16. 
  
Figure 2-16 - Clustered Multi-Family Units 
c.  Multi-family structures should be set back from adjacent public streets consistent with the prevailing setback pattern of the immediate neighborhood. 
d.  Multi-family projects with densities less than thirty units per acre should be comprised of "walk-up" rather than "stacked" units, with each unit adjacent to a street having its primary pedestrian entrance from the street sidewalk. Higher density projects should be designed either with ground floor units having individual sidewalk entrances, or as courtyard projects with at least one significant pedestrian entrance from the street sidewalk. Where individual units have access to the street sidewalk, private "front yard" outdoor space may be differentiated from the public right-of-way by a porch, or small yard enclosed by a low fence. See Figures 2-17 and 2-18. 
  
Figure 2-17 - Most Ground Floor Units Should Have Entrances Facing the Street 
e.  Residential units and activity areas not adjacent to a street should be accessible via pedestrian walkways and bikeways separate from vehicle parking areas and driveways. See Figure 2-18. 
  
Figure 2-18 - Walkways Separate From Vehicle Access 
2.  Parking and Driveways. Individual closeable garages are the preferred method for providing parking for residents in multi-family projects. If garages within the residential structures are not provided, dispersed parking courts are acceptable. 
a.  Long, monotonous parking drives and large, undivided parking lots are discouraged. 
b.  The main vehicle access into a multi-family site should be through an attractive entry drive. Colored and textured paving treatment is encouraged outside of the public street right-of-way, and within the project. 
c.  Parking areas should be visible from the residential units to the extent possible. 
d.  Safe and protected bicycle parking should be located convenient to each dwelling unit. 
e.  Parking courts, with or without carports, should not consist of more than two double-loaded parking aisles (bays) adjacent to each other. The length of a parking court should not exceed the width of eight adjoining stalls. 
f.  Parking courts should be separated from each other by buildings within the project or by landscape or natural open space areas at least thirty feet wide. 
g.  Large scale multi-family projects (i.e., more than twenty units) with internal streets should have the streets designed as if they were pleasant public streets, with comprehensive streetscapes including sidewalks, and planting strips between curb and sidewalk with canopy trees. 
h.  Private storage cabinets shall be provided in all car ports. 
3.  Multi-Family Project Architecture. The exterior design of multi-family projects should be derived from architectural styles in the surrounding neighborhood. Often, these types of projects are adjacent to single family neighborhoods, and care in design should ensure that the height and bulk of the higher density projects do not impact adjacent lower density residential areas. 
a.  Facade and Roof Articulation. A structure with three or more attached units should incorporate significant wall and roof articulation to reduce apparent scale. Changes in wall planes and roof heights, and the inclusion of elements such as balconies, porches, arcades, dormers, and cross gables can avoid the barracks-like quality of long flat walls and roofs. Secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are preferable to mansard roofs or segments of pitched roof applied at the structure's edge. Structures (including garages and carports) exceeding one hundred fifty feet in length are discouraged. See Figures 2-17 and 2-19. 
b.  Scale. Because multi-family projects are usually taller than one story, their bulk can impose on surrounding uses. The larger scale of these projects should be considered within the context of their surroundings. Structures with greater height may require additional setbacks at the ground floor level and/or upper levels (stepped-down) along the street frontage so they do not shade adjacent properties or visually dominate the neighborhood. Large projects should be broken up into groups of structures, and large single structures should be avoided. See Figure 2-19. 
c.  Balconies, Porches, and Patios. The use of balconies, porches, and patios as part of multi-family structures is encouraged for both practical and aesthetic value. These elements should be used to break up large wall masses, offset floor setbacks, and add human scale to structures. Multi-family units with individual access to the street sidewalk should have individual covered porches. See Figure 2-19. 
  
Figure 2-19 
d.  Dwelling Unit Access. The use of balconies and corridors to provide access to five or more units should be avoided. Access points to units should instead be clustered in groups of four or less. To the extent possible, main entrances to individual units should be from adjoining streets. Distinctive architectural elements and materials should be used to highlight primary entrances. 
e.  Exterior Stairways. Stairways providing access to the upper levels of multi-family structures should be located mostly within the buildings themselves. Where exterior stairways are necessary, they should provide residents and visitors protection from weather, and should be of stucco, plaster or wood, with accent trim to match the main structure. Thin-looking, open metal, prefabricated stairs that are not integrated with the design of the structure are discouraged. 
f.  Accessory Structures. Accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of a project. Their materials, color, and details should be the same as the principal structures on the site.

Chapter 17.20 - COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
17.20.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the commercial zoning districts established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site development. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.20.020 - Purposes of commercial zoning districts. 
The commercial zoning districts are intended to provide for a range of local-serving and regional-serving commercial uses, emphasizing high quality development, and to encourage revitalization of existing commercial land uses. The purpose of the individual commercial zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: 
A.  CC (Community Commercial) District. The CC zoning district is applied to areas suitable for a full range of retail, wholesale, and service uses including retail stores, apparel stores, specialty shops, shopping centers and home furnishings. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) is 0.4. The CC zoning district is consistent with the neighborhood/community commercial land use designation of the general plan. 
B.  GC (General Commercial) District. The GC zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a range of community serving commercial, regional retail, and service land uses. The FAR is 0.6. The GC zoning district is consistent with the general commercial land use designation of the general plan. 
C.  O (Office). The O zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for administrative, financial, business, professional, and medical offices. Support commercial uses are also permitted, subject to limitations. The maximum FAR is 0.6. The O zoning district is consistent with the office land use designation of the general plan. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.20.030 - Commercial zoning district land uses and permit requirements. 
Table 2-6 identifies the uses of land allowed by this development code in the commercial zoning districts, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 17.12.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements). 
Note: Where the last column in the tables ("specific use regulations") includes a section number, the regulations in the referenced section apply to the use; however, provisions in other sections of this development code may also apply.

17.20.050 - Commercial design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. The commercial design guidelines in this chapter are intended to assist in preserving and rehabilitating the commercial areas of Lodi. The guidelines are also intended to provide for infill commercial development of high architectural quality that is compatible with existing architecturally superior development, to promote the conservation and reuse of existing buildings of high quality design. While these guidelines are primarily oriented toward the downtown area, they are also designed to enhance and preserve the small town character of the city's other commercial areas. 
B.  Applicability. See Section 17.16.020 (Applicability of Design Guidelines). 
C.  Site Planning Outside of the Downtown. 
1.  Building and Parking Location. 
a.  General Placement Principles. Buildings should generally be oriented parallel to streets and placed as close to the street as required setbacks permit. Buildings may be angled to create interesting juxtapositions if there is a specific design goal to be achieved. However, definition of the street edge is an important role for buildings that should be considered in design. Exceptions may occur for wider setbacks from the street if a compatible use is proposed (for example, outdoor dining or pedestrian rest area) or to maintain continuity with landscaped areas on adjacent properties. 
  
Figure 2-20 - Building Placement of Street 
b.  Pedestrian Orientation. The orientation of buildings should establish and maintain pedestrian-oriented street frontages. Buildings with high pedestrian use should face, and be directly accessible from the public sidewalk. 
c.  Vehicle-Oriented Areas. Buildings in areas of the city that rely more on the use of the automobile for access should be oriented to major open space and streetscape elements, and as much as possible should not be located behind parking lots located between the building and the street. 
d.  Corner Buildings. Corner buildings should have a strong tie to the setback lines of each street. The primary mass of the building should not be placed at an angle to the corner. This does not preclude angled building corners or an open plaza at the corner which are strongly encouraged. 
e.  Projects with Multiple Structures. Multiple buildings in a single project should create a positive functional relationship with one another and the street. The first priority for multiple-building projects is to address the street with features that provide pedestrian interest and facilitate access to the project. Second, buildings should be clustered to achieve a "village" scale. This creates opportunities for internal plazas and pedestrian areas. When clustering is impractical, a visual link should be established between buildings. This link can be accomplished through the use of an arcade system, trellis, colonnade, and through enhanced paving. 
  
Figure 2-21 - Location of Parking and Buildings 
f.  Open Space Areas. Open space areas should be accessible from the majority of structures, and should be oriented to take advantage of sun or shade as appropriate. 
g.  Pedestrian Walkways. Projects should connect the on-site pedestrian circulation system to the off-site public sidewalk at intervals of at least one connection for each two hundred linear feet (or fraction thereof). Parking areas should be connected to building entrances by means of enhanced paving (patterned or stamped). 
2.  Building Orientation. The organization and orientation of commercial buildings and spaces is crucial in creating streets that are welcoming and friendly to pedestrians. Active public spaces and city streets that are heavily used by pedestrians contribute to the character and economic vitality of the city. High levels of pedestrian activity  shopping, eating, "people watching," exercising, strolling, relaxing, walking from place to place  are valued and encouraged throughout the city's commercial areas. These activities create interest, provide a sense of safety on the street, and add to community image and identity. The following guidelines provide a framework for site organization and orientation of commercial land uses. 
a.  Street Orientation. 
i.  Building facades, including storefronts, should be designed to orient to the major street frontage, with the primary building entry also oriented toward the major street. 
ii.  Buildings on corners should include storefront design features for at least fifty percent of the wall area on the side street elevation. 
iii.  Long, blank, unarticulated street wall facades are strongly discouraged unless unavoidable because of specific site circumstances. Monolithic street wall facades should be "broken" by vertical and horizontal articulation, characterized by: 
(A)  Sculpted, carved or penetrated wall surfaces defined by recesses and reveals); 
(B)  Breaks (reveals, recesses); 
(C)  Window and door openings; or 
(D)  Balconies, awnings and canopies. 
  
Figure 2-22 - Storefront Proportions 
iv.  Large unbroken facade surfaces should be avoided at the storefront level. This can be achieved in a number of ways including: 
(A)  Dividing the facade into a series of display windows with smaller panes of glass; 
(B)  Constructing the facade with small human scale materials such as brick or decorative tile along bulkheads; 
(C)  Providing traditional recessed entries; 
(D)  Careful sizing, placement and overall design of signage; and 
(E)  Providing consistent door and window reveals. 
b.  Street Edge. 
i.  The first floor of any infill commercial building should be built directly at the front property line C abutting the sidewalk C unless minor variations are permitted by the city for plazas, public art or other pedestrian-oriented purpose. 
  
Figure 2-23 - Placement of Infill Buildings 
ii.  Awnings, trellises and other accessory structures that are relatively open and do not restrict pedestrian or vehicular movement may project over the right-of-way with city approval. 
  
Figure 2-24 - Awnings Provide Pedestrian Scale and Comfort 
iii.  Any building located at a corner intersection should incorporate architectural features at the ground floor which emphasize the importance of pedestrian movement. These features may include building cut-offs, walk-through covered arcades, trellis structures and other elements which focus visual interest on the corners. 
  
Figure 2-25 - Desirable Design Features for Street Corner Buildings 
c.  Public Spaces. Public space associated with commercial buildings should serve as a transition from the outside to the inside of buildings, and should be supportive of pedestrian activity. Public areas should be designed so that all members of the public fee that they may enter, and should be designed as extensions of the public space of the sidewalk (e.g., by providing pedestrian amenities such as benches and fountains, and by continuing the hardscape of the sidewalk). 
i.  Plazas. 
(A)  Plazas should be designed to supplement, rather than replace on-street activity areas. Paving and furniture used in private plazas should complement streetscape elements used in the public right-of-way. 
(B)  Retail shops, restaurants, offices or other activity-generating uses should be located at the edges of plazas; blank walls should be minimized adjacent to pedestrian spaces. 
(C)  Plazas should be designed with unimpeded lines-of-sight to and from the public sidewalk. Security fences, walls, and entry gates shall not block the sidewalk edge of the plaza or views into the plaza. At least fifteen feet of building frontage should be transparent or visually penetrable to provide entry to and views into the plaza. 
(D)  Entries to a plaza, and storefront entries within the plaza, should be designed and lit so they do not create hiding places. 
(E)  Visual features, such as public art or a fountain, should be incorporated in plazas to attract pedestrians. 
(F)  Seating should be provided at a ratio of at least one seating area for each one hundred square feet of plaza, in addition to any outdoor dining areas. 
(G)  Plazas, including all entrances and exits, should be fully illuminated one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise to facilitate natural surveillance opportunities and to discourage illegitimate activities. Lighting should be designed to help define, order and further develop the design concept of the space in a manner that appears welcoming to pedestrians. 
(H)  Signs or other mechanisms should identify that the plaza is available for public use during business hours. 
(I)  Security gates and security fencing may not be used in plazas, except as may be permitted by the review authority when granting the land use permit for the project, based on a determination that unusual circumstances justify their use. 
ii.  Entry courtyards. Where used, courtyards should: 
(A)  Include focal elements of sculpture, water, plantings and seating niches. 
(B)  Be provided trees that are drought tolerant, and planted in symmetric patterns. 
(C)  Be designed to provide both visibility and separation from the street. 
D.  Building Design and Architecture. The visual relationships between individual commercial buildings contribute to community identity, levels of pedestrian activity, and economic vitality. When the architectural features (for example, entry spacing, window lines, and signs) of commercial buildings are complementary, the larger district image becomes more positive and unified. Building facades, in particular, influence cohesiveness, legibility and aesthetic pride. Likewise, storefront design can encourage shopping, increase a sense of security, and generate pedestrian activity. Where commercial buildings are neighbors to residential buildings, consideration of scale, detail, and materials are even more important. 
1.  Mass and Scale. Building scale and massing contributes to the unique character and pedestrian-orientation of the downtown and some of the other commercial areas of Lodi. Smaller-scale buildings, or buildings perceived to be of small-scale, are most suitable to creating the atmosphere desired in the city. Human-scale buildings are comfortable and create a friendly atmosphere that enhances the marketability of commercial areas. To this end, buildings and their parts should impart a sense of human scale and assume a reinforcing relationship with the sidewalk, street, and pedestrian activity. The relationship of the building elements to the overall building should create a clear set of meaningful relationships between the building and the elements and the elements to each other. The elements of the building should not appear as random or unrelated to each other. 
The height and scale of infill development and alterations to existing development within commercial areas should complement existing structures while providing a sense of human scale and proportion. Infill structures should be designed to provide storefront windows, doors, entries, transoms, awnings, cornice treatments and other architectural features designed to complement existing structures without duplicating a particular architectural style. Specific guidelines related to the mass and scale of building architecture are as follows: 
a.  General Design Principles. 
i.  The characteristic proportion (relationship of height to width) of existing facades should be considered in relation to infill development, alterations and additions. 
  
Figure 2-26 - Infill Facade Proportions 
ii.  Whenever an infill building is proposed which is much "wider" than the existing characteristic facades on the street, the infill facades should be broken down into a series of appropriately proportioned "structural bays" or components typically segmented by a series of columns or masonry piers which frame window, door and bulkhead components. Creating and reinforcing a facade rhythm helps tie the commercial street together visually and provides the pedestrian with a standard measurement of his or her progress. 
  
Figure 2-27 - Infill Structure Facade Divided into Bays 
iii.  The commercial buildings in Lodi are generally in the one- to three-story range. Infill buildings or upper story additions to existing buildings should not be much higher or lower than the height of surrounding structures. 
  
Figure 2-28 - Infill Consistent with Context 
b.  Building Proportions. 
i.  Maintain a clear visual distinction between upper story openings and street level storefront openings (windows and doors). There should usually be more window area at the storefront level to provide greater interior visibility for pedestrians, as opposed to upper stories with smaller window openings. 
  
Figure 2-29 - New Storefront Proportions Consistent with Context 
ii.  Whenever an infill building is proposed between two adjacent commercial structures, the characteristic rhythm, proportion and spacing of existing door and window openings should be maintained. 
c.  Horizontal Rhythms/Alignment of Architectural Elements. 
i.  When an infill building is proposed, the common horizontal elements (e.g. cornice line, window height/width and spacing) of neighboring structures should be identified and the infill should have similar rhythm or alignment. 
ii.  If maintaining a horizontal rhythm or alignment in an infill building is very difficult or otherwise impossible, the use of fabric canopies or awnings is encouraged to establish a shared horizontal storefront rhythm. 
d.  Architectural Features. 
i.  Features such as balconies, open and enclosed turrets, finials and bay windows that help give human scale and interest to buildings are encouraged. 
ii.  Decorative ornamentation, the decorative use of color and integral color materials, and architectural composition that employs abstract or representational ornament to help order the facade or emphasize the relative importance of different building elements are encouraged. 
2.  Architectural Elements/Materials. The types of materials and architectural elements incorporated into commercial buildings contribute to visual interest, community image, business identity and architectural quality. The following guidelines provide a framework for creating a cohesive commercial character while providing flexibility and promoting unique architectural features. 
a.  Entries and Doorways. 
i.  Main building entries should emphasize the point of arrival in one or more of the following ways: 
(A)  Placement of art or decorative detailing; 
(B)  A turret or balcony over the entrance; 
(C)  Change of material or detailing; 
(D)  Greater concentration of ornaments; 
(E)  Flanked columns, decorative fixtures or other details; 
(F)  Recesses within a larger arched or cased decorative opening; 
(G)  A portico (formal porch) projecting from or set into the building face; 
(H)  Changes in roofline, a tower, or a break in the surface of the subject wall; 
(I)  Architectural features above it. 
ii.  Street corner commercial buildings should provide a prominent entrance to street level shops or lobby space at or near the corner. 
  
Figure 2-30 - Prominent Corner Entrance 
b.  Doors and Windows. 
i.  Retail store doorways should contain a high percentage of glass to allow pedestrians to see the retail contents and activities in stores. 
  
Figure 2-31 - Maintain Extensive Storefront Glass Area 
ii.  When windows are added or changed, it is important that the design be compatible with the facade theme of the block (streetscape). 
iii.  Use clear glass (at least eighty-eight percent light transmission) in first floor windows. 
iv.  Storefront windows should be as large as possible and no closer than eighteen inches from the ground (bulkhead height). By limiting the bulkhead height, the visibility to the storefront displays and retail interior is maximized. Maximum bulkhead heights for infill construction should be seventeen inches. 
  
Figure 2-32 - Storefront Components 
v.  Introducing or changing the location or size of windows or other openings that alter the architectural rhythm or character of the original building is discouraged. 
vi.  Permanent, fixed security grates or grilles in front of windows are not permitted. Any necessary security grilles should be placed inside, behind the window display area. 
vii.  Traditional storefront transom windows should be retained whenever feasible. If the ceiling inside the structure has been lowered, the ceiling should be stepped up to meet the transom so that light will penetrate the interior of the building. 
  
Figure 2-33 - Transom Windows 
c.  Awnings and Canopies. 
i.  Where the facade of a commercial building is divided into distinct structural bays (sections defined by vertical architectural elements, such as masonry piers), awnings should be placed within the vertical elements rather than overlapping them. The awning design should respond to the scale, proportion and rhythm created by these structural bay elements and nestle into the space created by the structural bay. 
  
  
Figure 2-34 - Appropriate and Inappropriate Awning Forms 
ii.  Awning shape should relate to the window or door opening. Barrel-shaped awnings should be used to complement arched windows while square awnings should be used on rectangular windows. 
iii.  Awnings shall not be internally illuminated. 
d.  Grillwork/Metalwork and Other Details. There are a number of details, often thought of as mundane, which may be incorporated into the design to add a degree of visual richness and interest while meeting functional needs. These details include the following: 
i.  Light fixtures, wall mounted or hung with decorative metal brackets. 
ii.  Metal grillwork, at vent openings or as decorative features at windows, doorways or gates. 
iii.  Decorative scuppers, catches and down-spouts, preferably of copper. 
iv.  Balconies, rails, finials, corbels, plaques, etc. 
v.  Flag or banner pole brackets. 
  
Figure 2-35 - Metalwork Design Elements 
e.  Exterior Walls and Materials. The exterior wall design elements of commercial buildings involve two aspects C color and texture. Materials with integral color such as hard smooth troweled plaster, tile and stone is encouraged. If the building's exterior design is complicated, with many design features, the wall texture should be simple and subdued. However, if the building design is simple (perhaps more monolithic), a finely textured material, such as patterned masonry, can greatly enrich the building's overall character. 
Storefront materials should complement the materials used on significant adjacent buildings. The following materials are considered appropriate for commercial buildings within Lodi. The number of different wall materials used on any one building should be kept to a minimum, ideally two or less. 
  Clear glass; 
  Glass block (transom); 
  Exterior plaster (smooth trowelled preferred); 
  New or used face-brick; 
  Cut stone, rusticated block (cast stone); 
  Ceramic tiles (bulkhead); 
  Clapboard (where appropriate); 
The following exterior building materials are considered inappropriate in Lodi commercial areas and are discouraged: 
  Mirror glass and heavily tinted glass; 
  Windows with false divisions (i.e., a window where the glass continues uninterrupted behind a surface mounted mullion); 
  Vinyl and aluminum siding; 
  Painted or baked enamel metal awnings; 
  Rough "Spanish lace" stucco finish; 
  Unpainted plywood; 
  False stone veneer; 
  Bulky cast stone window and door surrounds; 
  Corrugated sheet metal; 
  Corrugated fiberglass; 
  Split face concrete block; 
  Exposed concrete block without integral color. 
f.  Lighting. 
i.  Lighting should be designed as an integral part of the overall site and building design. It should contribute to and help define the character and the spaces created by the building and its site development. Lighting design should have a conscious purpose of helping to strengthen the constituent elements of the site through means such as highlighting areas that are more important, or by picking out areas of the site that have a different character from the rest of the site. Lighting should complement architectural elements, changes in material of the ground plane and landscaping. The intensity, color, placement of the light and the placement and design of the light fixtures should be part of this effort. 
ii.  Lighting should provide illumination for the security and safety of on-site areas such as entrances, exits, parking, loading, pathways, and working areas. 
iii.  Lighting should be provided for the pedestrian to create a sense of welcoming on the public sidewalk, that the pedestrian is literally being accompanied by light. Providing a greater number of softer light sources is strongly encouraged over having only a few very bright lights. 
iv.  The design of light fixtures and their structural supports should be architecturally compatible with the main buildings on the site. Fixtures should be integrated within the architectural design for the buildings. 
v.  As a security device, lighting should be adequate but not overly bright. Building entrances should be well lighted. The lighting should be designed so that the lighting is an attractive element in its own right, acting as a public amenity. 
vi.  All lighting should be shielded to confine light spread within the site boundaries and not spill onto adjacent properties. Lighting should be provided from one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise at all exits, entrances, loading areas, parking lots, plazas, and alleys. An average of one foot candle evenly distributed across the site is a suggested minimum; with up to two-foot candles at entrances, exits and loading areas. 
vii.  The following lighting fixtures and lamps are considered inappropriate in Lodi commercial areas and are discouraged: 
  Mercury vapor lights (metal halide or high-pressure sodium lamps are preferable for most applications); 
  Fluorescent light tubes that are exposed without filtering lenses; 
  Fluorescent lamps without non-color corrected bulbs (color correction may also be accomplished by a color-correcting lens); 
  The development code prohibits flashing or blinking lights. 
viii.  Focus light downward. A good rule of thumb is to make sure that direct light shines a minimum of twenty degrees below a horizontal plane and in no case above the horizontal plane. 
ix.  Test installations for glare. After installation, check to make sure that glare will not be a problem for neighbors, pedestrians, or motorists. 
x.  Illuminate signs and billboards from above, not below. 
xi.  Avoid reflective surfaces beneath down-lit signs. 
xii.  All lighting shall be maintained in working order and in appearance. 
g.  Rear Entrances. Rear entrance design should consider a number of issues. In general, the rear entrance must respond to the same needs as the storefront, but at a reduced scale. It must also meet the functional service needs of the business, including providing a loading area. Since these two functions are often in conflict, the design of the rear entrance must be carefully planned. A particular concern is the storage and disposal of refuse. All trash cans, dumpsters, and other containers must be hidden and screened from public view as required by the development code. Exterior utilities must be screened. Regular maintenance is of paramount importance. 
The design of a rear entrance should be appropriate to its surroundings. The visual character of rear facades, alleys, and parking lots is relatively casual and utilitarian, especially when compared to formal street facades. In this context, a refined or grand design can look out of place. The design should instead be pleasantly inviting, and architecturally compatible with the front, but very simple in detail. 
  
Figure 2-36 - Rear Entrances Should be Aesthetically Simple and Utilitarian 
i.  An awning can soften a rear facade and provide a pleasant protected space. 
ii.  The rear entry door should be wood and glass similar to the front door. Special security glass (i.e. wire imbedded) is allowed. 
iii.  Security lighting should be modest and should focus on the rear entry door. 
iv.  Selective use of tree plantings, potted plants and other landscaping can subtly improve a rear facade. 
v.  Refuse containers and service facilities must be screened from view by solid walls. The use of landscaping (shrubs and vines) to screen walls can help deter graffiti. 
3.  AlterationsRestoration and Remodeling. Renovating or remodeling commercial structures provides an excellent means of maintaining and reinforcing the character and image desired in Lodi. Renovation and expansion not only increases property values in the area but also serves as an inspiration to other property owners and designers to make similar efforts. 
When an existing structure is to be renovated or added to, the work should respect the original design character of the structure. The following design guidelines apply where appropriate and whenever a structure is to be renovated or expanded. 
a.  Traditional Features and Decoration. 
i.  Sensitive response to existing materials, details, proportions, as well as patterns of materials and openings is required when any such work will affect the appearance of an existing building's exterior. 
ii.  Storefront remodeling often retains original decorative details only as visual "leftovers" or simply covers them. If a building is to be refurbished, these forgotten details should not be wasted. If enough of them remain, they can be restored as part of the original design. If only a few remain, they can be incorporated as design features in a new storefront. In either case, the design of any improvements should grow out of the remaining traditional details and create a harmonious background which emphasizes them. 
b.  Removal of Elements Inconsistent with Original Facade. Existing building elements incompatible with the original facade design should be removed. These include: excessive use of exterior embellishments and "modernized" elements (metal grilles, oversized molding cornices or rusticated materials, etc.). Buildings are often altered over time by owners or shopkeepers to "keep up with changing times" or to "remake a tired image." Unfortunately, such changes are often done in a "tacked-on" manner and result in gradual but severe erosion of original character and cohesion of the commercial area. 
c.  Storefront Renovation. 
i.  Where the original storefront remains (little or no remodeling has occurred), it should be preserved and repaired with as little alteration as possible. 
ii.  Where only part of the original storefront remains (limited remodeling has occurred), the storefront should be repaired, maintaining historic materials where possible, including the replacement of extensively deteriorated or missing parts with new parts based upon surviving examples of transoms, bulkheads, pilasters, signs, etc. 
  
Figure 2-37 
iii.  Where the original storefront is completely missing (extensive remodeling has occurred), the first priority is to reconstruct the storefront based upon historical, pictorial and physical documentation. If that is not practical, the design of the new storefront should be compatible with the size, scale, proportion, material and color of the existing structure. 
d.  Window Replacement. 
i.  The impact of windows on the facade is determined by the size, shape, pattern of openings, spacing and placement within the facade. When altering or reconstructing windows, consideration of these elements is crucial to retaining the structure's original architectural balance and integrity. 
ii.  Wherever possible retain original window openings. If the existing ceiling has been lowered, pull the dropped ceiling back from the original window. 
iii.  If possible, save and restore original windows and frames. Replace missing, rotting or broken sash, frames, mullions and muntins with similar material. 
iv.  If original window openings have been altered, restore the openings to their original configuration and detail. Avoid blocking or filling window openings that contribute to the overall facade design. 
v.  When replacing windows, consideration should be given to the original size and shape detailing and framing materials. Replacement windows should be the same operating type as the original window. 
  
  
Figure 2-38 - Window Replacement 
e.  Door Replacement. 
i.  Original doors and door hardware should be retained, repaired and refinished provided they can comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). 
ii.  If replacement doors are necessary, they should be compatible with the historical character and design of the structure. 
f.  Additions to Existing Structures. 
i.  The design of a proposed addition should follow the general scale, proportion, massing and detailing of the original structure and should result in a harmoniousrather than stark-contrast. 
ii.  Additions should be interpretations of the existing buildings, with the main characteristics of the existing structure incorporated using modern construction methods. This may include: the extension of architectural lines from the existing structure to the addition; repetition of window and entrance spacing; use of harmonizing colors and materials; and the inclusion of similar, yet distinct, architectural details (i.e., window and door trim, lighting fixtures, tile or brick decoration, etc.). 
iii.  Additions should be designed so that if the addition were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired. 
g.  Seismic Retrofitting. Where structural improvements for seismic retrofitting affect the building exterior, such improvements should be done with care and consideration for the impact on appearance of the building. Where possible, such work should be concealed. Where this is not possible, the improvements should be planned to carefully integrate into the existing building design. 
4.  Equipment and Utilities. 
a.  All mechanical or utility equipment, whether on the roof, ground or side of building must be screened from view, above or below. The method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials, color, shape and size. The design of the screening should be done in concert with and as a part of the design of the building, rather than as an afterthought. 
b.  Roof mounted mechanical or utility equipment must be screened. The method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials, color, shape and size. It is preferable to screen equipment with solid building elements (e.g. parapet wall) instead of after-the-fact add-on screening (e.g. wood or metal slats). 
c.  Air conditioning units placed in individual windows and window transom areas are strongly discouraged. 
  
  
Figure 2-38 - Equipment Screening 
E.  Security. Safety in commercial areas is important to business owners, workers and visitors, and to the overall economic well-being of businesses. Design strategies incorporating safety should be based on the practice called Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design or CPTED (pronounced "sep-ted"). CPTED focuses on the proper design and use of the built environment to enhance opportunities for positive, constructive activities while minimizing opportunities for illegitimate or undesirable activities. CPTED is a measure for proactive and retrofit crime prevention planning one that can help reduce the incidence and fear of crime, and improve overall quality of life. By no means is CPTED a panacea in the efforts to rid communities of crime; however, it is one strategy among others that should be considered in commercial development. There are five principles used in the application of CPTED: Natural Surveillance, Natural Access Control, Territorial Reinforcement, and Management and Maintenance. 
1.  Natural Surveillance. The organization of physical features, activities and people in such a way as to maximize visibility. That is, a space should be designed so that users feel that they will be seen or observed if they do something illegitimate. The placement of windows, doors, and plazas, the alignment of sidewalks and paths, the minimization of large areas of blank walls, the locations and levels of lighting, and the proper design and size of open spaces can contribute to natural surveillance opportunities. 
2.  Natural Access Control. The physical guidance of people coming and going from a space by the judicial placement of entrances, exits, signs, fencing, landscaping and lighting. A space should be designed so that it is conducive to the activities undertaken by legitimate, law-abiding users but discouraging to those carrying out undesirable activities. 
3.  Territorial Reinforcement. The use of physical attributes that express ownership, such as fences, pavement treatments, art, signage and landscaping. CPTED stresses the importance of clearly designing a hierarchy of spaces: public (i.e. intended for all to use), semi-private (i.e. intended for specific users or uses), private (i.e. intended for private use by businesses). 
4.  Management and Maintenance. The continued use of a space for its intended purpose, which serves as an additional expression of ownership (e.g., complying with landscape maintenance and lighting standards to ensure that visibility is not reduced). Although the physical dimensions of CPTED are important, no effort is sustained unless it is properly maintained and operated. 
5.  Design Considerations. The following design considerations, as well as many of the preceding guidelines, incorporate CPTED principles and should be considered for new commercial development in Lodi. 
a.  Window Materials. Storefront security may be enhanced with shatter-resistant laminated vigil pane security glass (or glass-clad polycarbonate windows). 
b.  Security Screens. The use of exterior scissors-style security screens is strongly discouraged. Any use of interior scissors screens shall be concealed from public view when not in use by retracting the screen into casings which are in proportion and scale with the building architecture. However, although they are allowed, the use of interior scissors screens is strongly discouraged since they communicate a message of high crime and cannot be integrated visually into the overall design of a building or storefront. 
  
Figure 2-39 - Security Screen Placement 
c.  Security Bars. Permanent security bars (those clearly visible and fixed to windows or the facade) and exterior roll-up metal security doors are strongly discouraged. 
d.  Lighting Placement. Exterior lights that are a part of streetscape improvements should provide adequate lighting levels. However, in the case of a deep threshold to a building, a light applied to the ceiling of this area is strongly recommended to illuminate building entrances. 
e.  Lighting Design. Lighting should be designed to satisfy both functional and decorative needs. Storefront lighting should complement the architectural style of the building while providing illumination of building facades and entrances. 
f.  Rear Security Lighting. Rear security lighting should be provided and maintained at twelve-foot candles per square foot. The level of lighting should be measured at ground level. All security lighting should be designed as part of an overall lighting plan rather than as single stand-alone elements. 
g.  Window Signs. Any window signs should be placed to provide a clear and unobstructed view of the interior of the business establishment from the sidewalk (and are not permitted by this development code to exceed twenty percent of the window area). 
h.  Street Addresses. Street addresses should be identified by posting numbers so they are clearly visible from the public right-of-way wherever possible. 
  
Figure 2-40 - Street Addresses Should Help Easy Identification 
i.  Safety Behind Buildings. Safety behind buildings should be ensured through use of: 
i.  Adequate security lighting for parking areas and pedestrian ways; 
ii.  Limited access (walls, fences, gates, shrubs); 
iii.  Signage; 
iv.  Introduction of activities (e.g., rear entrances for commercial activities) that increase surveillance; 
v.  Surveillance through windows or with cameras; and 
vi.  Ongoing maintenance of storage areas and alleys. 
F.  Walls and Fences. If walls or fences are not required for a specific screening or security purpose they should not be used. Any necessary walls or fences should be as low as possible while still performing their screening and security functions. 
1.  Materials and Colors. Fences and walls should be designed with materials and colors that complement project architecture. When selecting wood as a material, it is important to consider its increased maintenance demands. Landscaping should be used in combination with walls whenever possible. 
2.  Design. Long expanses of wall or fence surfaces should be offset and architecturally designed to prevent monotony. Landscape pockets should be provided along the wall. 
3.  Security Fencing. When required, security fencing should be a combination of solid pillars, or short solid wall segments, and wrought iron grille work.

Chapter 17.22 - MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
17.22.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the mixed use zoning districts established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site development. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.22.020 - Purposes of mixed use zoning districts. 
The mixed use zoning districts are intended to provide for a range of uses, emphasizing high quality development, and to encourage revitalization of existing land uses. The purpose of the individual mixed use zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: 
A.  DMU (Downtown Mixed Use) District. The DMU zoning district is applied to the downtown area, and is intended to allow for a broad range of commercial land uses primarily located on the ground floor. Residential uses may also be allowed in this district. The maximum FAR is 3.00. The DMU zoning district is consistent with the downtown mixed use land use designation of the general plan. 
B.  MCE (Mixed Use Center) District. The MCE zoning district is applied to the new mixed-use neighborhood centers in the new growth areas of the general plan. This category provides for a variety of residential, office, neighborhood commercial and public uses. The maximum FAR is 1.0. The MCE zoning district is consistent with the mixed use center land use designation of the general plan. 
C.  MCO (Mixed Use Corridor) District. The MCO zoning district is applied along the city's major corridors: Kettleman and Cherokee lanes and Lodi Avenue. This category provides for a variety of office and general commercial uses, as well a low-, medium-, and high-density residential. The maximum FAR is 1.2. The MCO zoning district is consistent with the mixed use corridor land use designation of the general plan. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.22.030 - Mixed use zoning districts land uses and permit requirements. 
Table 2-8 identifies the uses of land allowed by this development code in the mixed use zoning districts, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 17.12.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).

(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.22.050 - Downtown mixed use design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. A vital component to the revitalization strategy adopted for the downtown area was to create and establish land use policies and design guidelines that build on the existing palette of architectural forms and building materials. A primary purpose of the downtown mixed use design guidelines is to ensure that high quality design is maintained for all new construction and rehabilitation projects within the district. The guidelines are intended to encourage individual creativity of project designers while respecting the needs of the individual owner and user. The guidelines are intended to: create a distinctive and cohesive image for downtown Lodi; assure that all new development, rehabilitation and improvements give consideration to quality design in architecture and site planning; protect and enhance property values and investment; and provide consistency and compatibility within the downtown. The development standards and design guidelines promote buildings and renovations that strengthen the existing "Main Street" character of the downtown area and enhance a pedestrian-oriented retail and entertainment niche. Among other things, they require buildings to help shape the street as a pedestrian space. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The downtown mixed use design guidelines shall apply to all of the properties designated as downtown mixed use in the general plan. The design elements of each project (including site design, architecture, landscaping, signs, parking design) will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis. 
2.  The downtown mixed use guidelines augment other sections of the development code. When an issue, condition or situation occurs which is not covered or provided for in the design guidelines, the regulations of the development code that are most applicable to the issue, conditions or situation shall apply. In the event that the provisions of the design guidelines are in conflict with other sections of the development codes, the provisions of the design guidelines shall prevail. 
C.  Development Standards. Development standards address those aspects that are essential to achieve the goals of the concept plan. They are specifications for building design and site development such as height, setbacks, and permitted uses. Standards are required minimums or benchmarks that all projects must adhere to. 
1.  Land Use. Successful downtowns involve uses that generate activity. These uses can populate the streets, create excitement, increase safety and reinforce downtown as an important destination. Among the uses that contribute to this activity are specialty retail shops, eating and drinking establishments, and entertainment facilities. 
The importance of the downtown can also be enhanced by emphasizing the mixture and intensity of uses that occur, including housing and office uses. This is particularity true for vertical mixture with residential and offices above the first floor. 
a.  Permitted Ground Level UsesSchool Street Frontage. 
i.  Retail: All uses except drive-up or drive-in services. 
ii.  Eating and Drinking Establishments: Including those serving alcoholic beverages, provided this service is clearly ancillary to food service; drive-up or drive-in restaurants not permitted. 
iii.  Personal Services: Hair and nail salons, shoe repair, laundromats, dry cleaners, and similar businesses. 
iv.  Business Services: Are storefront businesses that generate foot traffic, such as photocopy shops, photo-finishers, video rental and sales, travel agencies, appliance repair, print shops, insurance agencies, or real estate agencies, financial institutions, and public utilities. 
v.  Nightclubs: Including establishments providing entertainment or permitting dancing, and establishments serving alcoholic beverages not ancillary to food service. (Above uses may require a conditional use permit as required by the Lodi Municipal Code). 
vi.  Other Business or Service Establishments: If determined by the community development department staff to be of the same general character as those uses listed herein and above. 
b.  Permitted Uses: All Other street Frontages and Upper Level School Street Frontage. 
i.  All permitted uses listed above. 
ii.  Drive-through establishments. 
iii.  Professional offices. 
c.  Upper Level Uses Subject to a Conditional Use Permit. 
i.  Clubs and lodges. 
ii.  Residences. 
iii.  Other service establishments if determined by the city to be of the same general character as listed therein and above.

iv.  Trash and Service Equipment: Including satellite receiving dishes, shall be located away from streets and enclosed or screened by landscaping, fencing or other architectural means. 
D.  Design Guidelines. Design Guidelines are Discretionary. They are intended to illustrate and simplify the appropriate development and renovation concepts in terms of more subjective considerations, such as character or design details. The guidelines are not intended to be an exhaustive list of strict standards, but rather, statements to encourage improvement which is sensitive to the downtown. They also serve as criteria for design review by city staff and the site plan and architectural review committee (SPARC). No particular architectural style is prescribed. 
1.  Building Composition: Every building should have a base, a clear pattern of openings and surface features, a recognizable entry, and an interesting roofline. 
2.  Storefronts: Are like small buildings with their own base, "roofline", and pattern of window and door openings 
a.  Base: Panel of tile or other special material is recommended below display windows. Materials recommended for walls are generally suitable. Base materials should be the same or visually "heavier" materials than walls. 
i.  Brick should be used as the main wall surface. 
ii.  Ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base. Dark tile with light stucco is an effective combination. Different colors and sizes of tile may be used for a decorative effect. 
b.  Display Windows. Large pane windows encompassing a minimum of sixty percent of the storefront surface area are recommended. Where privacy is desired for restaurants, professional service, etc., windows should be divided into smaller panes. Tinted windows may be used. (Refer to glazing section). 
c.  Transom windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and second floor. They are a traditional element of "main street" buildings, and are recommended for all new or renovated storefronts. Transom windows can be good locations for neon, painted-window, and other relatively non-obtrusive types of signs. 
d.  Recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront. Recommended treatments include: 
i.  Special paving materials such as ceramic tile; 
ii.  Ornamental ceiling treatments, such as coffering; 
iii.  Decorative light fixtures. 
e.  Doors should be substantial and well-detailed. They are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel. They should match the materials, design and character of the display window framing. Door styles six inches or less are not recommended. 
f.  Cornices should be provided at the second floor (or roofline for a one-story building) to differentiate the storefront from upper levels of the building to add visual interest, and to allow the storefront to function as the base for the rest of the building. 
g.  New or renovated storefronts within existing buildings should emulate or re-create a previous store front (from historic photos or drawings) in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture. 
3.  Building increments storefronts and/or building bays should be approximately twenty-five feet in width. Buildings with a longer frontage should have a vertical architectural feature-column, pilaster, etc. every twenty-five feet. 
a.  Pattern of features windows, wall, panels, pilaster, building bays, and storefronts should be based on a module derived from the building's structural bay spacing. Features based on this module should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank, uninteresting surfaces. 
b.  Building entrances should be prominent and easy to identify. 
i.  Spacing entries to shops or lobbies should be spaced a maximum of fifty feet apart. 
ii.  Main building entrance should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from storefronts: 
(A)  Marked by a taller mass above, such as a tower, or within a volume that protrudes from the rest of building surface; 
(B)  Located in the center of the facade, as part of a symmetrical overall composition; 
(C)  Accented by architectural elements, such as columns, overhanging roofs, awnings, ornamental light fixtures. 
iii.  Prominent corner entrances for shops or other active uses should be provided by corner buildings. 
c.  Roofs and rooflines should provide visual interest and complement the overall facade composition. 
i.  Parapet walls are recommended; they should have a distinct shape or profile, e.g. a gable, arc, raised center. 
ii.  Accent elements such as flags, cut-out openings, grilles and latticework, ornamental medallions or building numbers are also recommended. 
iii.  Mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened, preferably behind a parapet roof. Latticework, louvered panels, and other treatments that are compatible with the building's architecture may also be appropriate. 
4.  Special architectural features such as gables and tower elements, should be used to accent buildings at major street corners and other highly-visible locations. A cut into the building mass, such as a diagonal at a corner building, or a notch for a grand building entry, can also be effective. 
5.  Side and rear building facades should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front facade or an architectural mural, particularly if they are visible from streets, adjacent parking areas or residential buildings. 
6.  Wall Treatments: If the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex, simple wall surfaces are preferable (e.g. stucco). If the building volume and the pattern of wall openings is simple, additional wall texture and articulation should be employed (e.g. bricks or blocks). In both cases, pilasters, columns, and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale. 
The selection and placement of materials on the exterior of a building is important in providing an attractive design. Material change should occur on different planes in order to appear more substantial and integral to the design of the elevation. Change should occur where architectural elements intersect, such as a pilaster or projection. The number of materials on the exterior elevation should be limited to prevent visual overload. Materials should have a traditional or logical application. Heavy materials should appear to hold up lighter materials. 
a.  Brick: Full size brick veneer is preferable to brick tile. Brick veneers should be mortared to give the appearance of structural brick. Brick tile applications should use wrap-around corner and bullnose pieces to minimize a veneer appearance. 
b.  Brick Veneers: Are appropriate as a special material for wall panels or sills in combination with other materials, such as brick or concrete. 
c.  Poured-In-Place Concrete: Options in terms of formwork, pigments, and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces. Accents such as ceramic tile are recommended for decorative effect. 
d.  Concrete Block: Concrete block is available in various sizes, surface textures, and colors. Decorative treatments, such as alternating, courses of differing heights, should be used. Stack bond, plain gray concrete block is not recommended 
e.  Ceramic tile is recommended as an accent material. 
f.  Stucco integral coloring should be used for lower maintenance and wear. 
g.  Not Recommended: 
i.  Simulated finishes such as artificial stone or metal cladding. 
ii.  Wood shingles and shakes: Vertical board and batten, shingles, shakes, are not recommended; they have a rural/residential character. 
iii.  Plywood siding. (Includes T-111 siding) 
7.  Windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality. 
a.  Window/Wall Proportion: In general, upper stories should have a window to wall area proportion (typically thirty to fifty percent) that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts. 
b.  Window openings should generally be vertical or square in shape; if square, windows and/or window panes should be vertical in shape. 
c.  Window inset glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface; this is especially important for stucco buildings. 
d.  Shaped frames, sills and/or lentils should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief. They should be proportional to the glass area framed; e.g. a larger window should have thicker framing members. 
e.  Muntins "true divided light" windows or sectional windows are recommend where a divided window design is desired; where "snap-in" muntins are used, they must be both sides of the glass. 
f.  Glazing: Clear glazing is strongly recommended. Reflective glazing should not be used. If tinted glazing is used, the tint should be kept as light as possible; green, gray, and blue are recommended. 
g.  Replacement/renovation: Wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type (e.g. double-hung, casement, etc.). Vinyl covered wood windows are available for lower maintenance. If aluminum replacement windows or doors are used, they should be: 
i.  Same operating type and orientation as the original windows (e.g. do not replace a double-hung window with a horizontal sliding window). 
ii.  Factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original; color anodized is also acceptable. 
iii.  Similar in size and thickness to the original frame and muntins. 
8.  Roofs should match the principal building in terms of style, detailing and materials. They should also contribute expressive and interesting forms that add to the overall character of the district. Recommended types are: 
a.  Tar and gravel, composition, or elastomeric roofs should be screened by parapets or false-front sections of sloping roofs. 
b.  Clay, ceramic or concrete tile: Colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes, such as parapets, domes, and turrets. 
c.  Metal seam roofing should be anodized, fluorocoated or painted. Copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized. 
9.  Canopies, Awnings, and Other Building-Mounted Accessories. 
a.  Awnings are Recommended. They should be a colorful fabric mounted over a metal structural that is framed and attractive in design. Fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies. Internally illuminated vinyl awnings are not acceptable. 
b.  Trellises and canopies materials, colors, and form should be derived from the building architecture. 
c.  Height and projection trellises, canopies and awnings should be a minimum of eight feet above the sidewalk. They should project no more than two feet from the face of curb, depending upon the width of the sidewalk. 
d.  Placement of trellises, canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel. They should not cover pipes, pilasters, clerestory windows or other architectural features. Individual awnings accents and complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning. 
e.  Accessories colorful banners should be used to add variety to the street. Ornamental brackets and poles add further interest. Hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts. 
10.  Color: In general, drab earthtones should not be used. Building wall color should contrast trim colors; for example, neutral or light walls with dark colors and saturated hues for accent and ornamental colors; white or light window and door trim on a medium or dark building wall. Colors of adjacent buildings should be taken into consideration. 
a.  Secondary color (like a wainscot), pilasters, cornices, capitals, and bands. 
b.  Bright colors should be used sparingly. Typical applications are fabric awnings and banners. A restrained use of bright colors also allows display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field. 
E.  Additions, Renovations and Restorations. Changes to the commercial environment will most likely take place in the form of renovation or restoration. As uses change and remodeling projects are proposed, owners are encouraged to upgrade their property in a manner consistent with the character of the downtown. One of the most effective ways to attract attention and encourage shopping is to create an attractive, well designed storefront and building entry. Many buildings in Downtown Lodi have distinctive architectural qualities that make important contributions to the visual character. These qualities could be improved or emphasized to the benefit of the entire area. 
Sensitive alteration or restoration of existing buildings enhances their historic value. To ensure proper work, the services of an architect specializing in restoration and preservation work are highly recommended. 
1.  Additions and alterations should be sensitive to the scale and character of storefront areas in general, of adjacent buildings, and of the building itself. Generally, they should reflect one of the following conditions: 
a.  Identical to the architecture of the original building, as if the same architect or builder built more of the same building. This is usually most successful and feasible where the addition is smaller than the original building. 
b.  Interpretation of the older building (and/or other adjacent buildings). The older building is not imitated exactly, but certain characteristics are copied using contemporary materials and construction practices. This is most successful where the addition is larger than the older building. Some of their "contextual" strategies are: 
i.  Architectural lines and rhythms of older buildings are extended to the new building; such as floor and cornice heights, window and bay spacing, 
ii.  Colors and materials are selected to coordinate and harmonize between the old and new structures. 
iii.  Small elements may be identical on both buildings to link them; window and door trim, paint colors, signs, light fixtures, etc. 
2.  Restorations: Restoring the original form and appearance of old buildings is recommended. Many "modernization's" of 19th and early 20th century storefront buildings cover fine facades and other architectural features that can be restored. Paint, covered, or blocked-in clerestory windows are common, as are upper stories that have been plastered over or covered with metal fascia or awnings. 
3.  Repair and Cleaning: Care should be taken to avoid damaging the value of historic buildings. In particular: 
a.  Masonry materials such as concrete and brick should not be sandblasted, as this damages the surface of the material; low-pressure water cleaning should be used instead. Sealers for waterproofing should be used after cleaning and repair. 
4.  Replacement of Unavailable Components: When historic construction materials cannot be replaced or matched, care should be taken to match the original pattern, thickness, color, and texture as closely as possible with available materials. In general, simulated replacement materials (artificial stone, simulated "aged" brick) are discouraged. The restoration architect and various specialty building supply businesses can assist in the selection of proper materials. 
F.  Lighting. Building and accent lighting in the downtown is an effective mechanism to attract attention to a structures details and the business as well. Further, lighting shall be used for parking areas, passageways and sidewalks. 
1.  Area lighting sources for illuminating sidewalks passageways, parking, and rear and side yard areas: 
a.  Shall be shielded from casting light onto adjacent properties. They shall not cast light directly into adjacent residential windows. A translucent or optical lens diffuser globe or shield is recommended. 
b.  Maximum mounting height of light sources for ground level illumination shall be sixteen feet, measured from the finished grade of the area to be lit; height must be eighteen feet at minimum if extending over a roadway surface. 
2.  Ornamental fixtures not used as primary area lighting and mounted with visible light sources: 
a.  With clear or no diffuser individual lamp wattage should not exceed sixty watts incandescent, twenty watts fluorescent, or forty watts high intensity discharge (H.I.D., such as metal halide, high pressure sodium, or mercury vapor lamps). 
b.  With frosted or optical (fresnel type) light fixture diffuser individual lamp wattage may not exceed one hundred watts incandescent, forty watts fluorescent, or seventy watts H.I.D. 
3.  Commercial Areas. The following recommendations are intended to promote an attractive nighttime pedestrian environment. They apply to lighting installations by either the private or public sector: 
a.  Specialized Professional Assistance. A good lighting design can make both tenant businesses and buildings highly recognizable and attractive by night, and contribute to the district's distinctiveness. The services of a lighting designer are highly recommended, as such a specialist can demonstrate and provide the best effect within a specified budget. 
b.  Lighting Design. 
i.  Use the minimum brightness for illumination of large areas. 
ii.  Use brighter light to punctuate and accent important areas such as entries and special architectural features. 
c.  Recommended lamp color/types. Color corrected ("white") high pressure sodium (HPS); color corrected (three thousand degrees K); incandescent. 
d.  Lamps not recommended. Standard ("peach") high pressure sodium, low. 
e.  Metalwork. Portions of lighting should be architecturally related to the building architecture. The color and finish of lighting metalwork should match the building's metalwork, if any. 
f.  Recommended globes. Clear borosilicate glass globes; clear acrylic or polycarbonate globes with optical diffusing (fresnel) patterns; translucent clear (frosted) or white acrylic or polycarbonate globes. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.22.060 - Mixed use center design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. The mixed use center design guidelines are intended to provide clear and useful recommendations for the design, construction, review, and approval of mixed use center development in the city of Lodi. Mixed use center development will play a vital role in creating neighborhoods centers where people can walk between home, work, shopping, and recreation. This chapter will help ensure that new projects will be well designed, uphold the city's vision, and contribute to the quality of the public realm. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The design guidelines in this chapter apply to the three sites designated as mixed use center in the general plan. The design elements of each project (including site design, architecture, landscaping, signs, parking design) will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis. 
2.  The review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
C.  Site Planning. 
1.  Require all development at sites designated mixed use center to provide a mix of commercial uses, while allowing residential uses, to create a "node," typically centered around a plaza, or "a central street," with a minimum of ten percent of the land area devoted to non-residential land uses, to create pedestrian vitality in the core area. Allow a range of other supportive commercial uses, such as medical, dental, and real-estate offices, as well as community facilities. 
2.  Require each core (minimum parcel size of fifteen acres) to have at least one plaza or other satisfactory gathering space along the central street that enables gathering and promotes a sense of neighborhood identity. 
3.  Block lengths within mixed use center areas shall not exceed four hundred feet. 
D.  Building Placement. 
1.  Buildings shall be constructed near or along the front property line(s). A "zero setback" from the front property line(s) is encouraged. 
2.  Variations in the zero setback from the property line(s) may be appropriate when the resulting setback provides greater accommodation for pedestrian circulation, sidewalk dining areas, enhanced entries, and improves the pedestrian realm. 
3.  When a front setback is necessary, a majority of the setback shall be hardscaped with limited landscaping to accommodate uses that keep the public realm active, such as outdoor dining and seating. 
4.  Require that any office uses in mixed use center front along the street edge with minimal setbacks. 
E.  Building Orientation. 
1.  The main pedestrian access point to the building shall be located along the facade that is oriented to the primary street. 
2.  Buildings on corner lots shall have the primary entry facing the intersection. Corner entries help create an active public realm and reinforce significant street and sidewalk intersections. 
3.  Entries that face the primary street shall be directly connected to the street's sidewalks. Secondary and residential entrances can be connected to interior courtyards and parking lots. 
4.  The most active ground floor uses such as storefronts, lobbies, and restaurant dining areas shall front the public sidewalk. Private amenities, such as courtyards, that are not accessible to the public shall be located within the project site or on upper floors and not along the street. 
5.  For buildings sited on less significant intersections, such as a major arterial and a collector, at least fifty percent of the side street ground floor elevation shall include storefront design features. 
F.  Building Design and Architecture. 
1.  Building Organization and Frontage. 
a.  In mixed use centers the development of a complex of buildings is preferable to a single large structure because the varied massing provides visual interest and human scale. Additionally, the spaces created between the various buildings provide opportunities for pedestrian plazas, courtyards and other outdoor gathering areas. 
b.  Building plans, facades, and architectural details shall create visual interest at the street level (e.g., staggering the frontage of the building, recessing doors and windows, providing awnings and canopies for weather protection and scale, and visually extending interior spaces outside through paving and glazing to create the concept of an indoor/outdoor room, etc.). 
c.  Projects located at intersections shall ensure the design treatments are continued around the corner. 
d.  Development located at signalized intersections of major streets shall be encouraged to include pedestrian-oriented, community serving commercial uses such as a bookstore, coffee shop, or local market. 
2.  Articulation. 
a.  Buildings shall be articulated to reflect a small-scale street frontage rhythm, with building bay widths of approximately twenty-five to fifty feet. 
b.  Where multiple-tenant spaces are incorporated into a building, individual tenant spaces shall be located within the building bays. This can be achieved by any of the following: 
i.  Placing a column, pier or pilaster between facade elements. 
ii.  Applying vertical slot or recess between facade elements. 
iii.  Providing variation in plane along the building wall. 
iv.  Varying the building wall by recessing the storefront entrance or creating a niche for landscaping or pedestrian area. 
c.  Primary building entries shall be accented with strong architectural definition. 
d.  Mixed use buildings shall be designed with a distinct "base", "middle", and "top" to create a human-scaled public realm. Elements that are recommended to articulate a building's facade include: 
i.  Design details for the top of a building, including cornice lines, parapets, eaves, brackets and other detailing. 
ii.  Design details for the body, or middle, of the building including windows, awnings, trellises, canopies, alcoves, balconies, pilasters, columns, decorative lighting and window boxes. 
iii.  Design details for the base of a building, including recessed entry areas, covered outdoor areas and alcoves. 
e.  The proportion and placement of windows on upper floors shall be designed to look different from the windows on the ground floor. 
f.  Awnings are encouraged, and if used, should be provided over each storefront of buildings with multiple storefronts. These awnings should be located within the individual structural bays and should not hide architectural detailing. 
g.  Awnings on multi-tenant buildings should be the same color and style and should be consistent with the character and design of the building. 
h.  In order to promote active, pedestrian-friendly streets, each individual tenant or business establishment and residential lobbies shall be oriented to and accessible from the major street frontage and directly accessible from the public sidewalk. 
i.  Rear walls and elevations visible from the public right-of-way shall be designed to maximize visual appeal by using vertical and horizontal wall plane breaks. 
3.  Roofs. 
a.  Roofs should be compatible with the architectural style of the building. 
b.  The roof shape should reflect the configuration of the building's mass and volume, and should be consistent in its character from all vantage points. 
c.  Sloping roof forms are encouraged. 
d.  The visible portion of sloped roofs shall be sheathed with a roofing material complementary to the architectural style of the building. 
e.  All buildings shall provide cornice or parapet detailing in order to delineate a strong roofline along the primary facades. 
f.  Cornices and horizontal bands of genuine materials, such as wood trim rather than foam are strongly encouraged. 
g.  False fronts, applied mansard forms and other artificial rooflines that are not an integral component of the architectural design should be avoided. 
4.  Building Materials. 
a.  A well-defined building "base" (i.e., ground floor) provides scale and articulation at the pedestrian level. The "base" shall consist of traditional thicker walls along with high quality, durable, and easy to clean materials and finishes. Special materials (e.g., granite, marble, polished stone, and other metal panels) shall be utilized as accent materials on the building's "base." 
b.  Upper floors that are less prone to potential vandalism shall utilize high quality finish materials of traditional mixed-use projects (e.g., brick veneer, smooth troweled stucco, etc.). 
c.  Materials and colors shall be selected to unify the building appearance and fit into the pedestrian context. Avoid overly vibrant colors and/or monochromatic color palettes. 
d.  Awning materials should be compatible with the overall design and character of the building. The use of fabric awnings is encouraged. The use of vinyl and plastic awnings is discouraged. 
5.  Windows. 
a.  Windows shall be large glazed panels, possibly with small upper transoms. Window patterns shall have a slight inset and not appear flat. Glass shall be clear (eighty-eight percent light transmission) and not heavily tinted so as to provide views into active spaces or window displays. 
b.  A minimum of sixty percent of linear store frontage at the street facade should be used for the display windows and evenly distributed. False fronts or windows should not be included that are not integral components of the building. 
c.  Windows on the upper floors shall be smaller in size than storefront windows on the first floor and shall encompass a smaller proportion of facade surface area. 
d.  Upper story windows shall be detailed with architectural elements, such as projecting sills, molded surrounds and/or lintels. 
e.  Where unique use or occupancy requirements preclude the addition of windows, such as theaters or parking structures, exterior walls shall be designed to provide architectural relief or shall be screened by landscaping and pedestrian amenities, such as trellises, benches or shade structures. 
f.  To ensure and protect the privacy of residents in adjacent single-family homes, windows in mixed-use projects facing single family residences within fifteen feet of the property line, shall be carefully arranged. Examples of privacy options include translucent or louvered windows, offset window patterns, and locating windows five-feet above the floor level. 
G.  Plazas. 
1.  Plazas shall incorporate high quality paving materials, such as stone, concrete or tile. The paving shall complement the adjacent public streetscape elements. 
2.  Plazas should be visible from public streets and the pedestrian network and accessible from the building as well as the street and pedestrian network. 
3.  Focal elements such as sculptures, art, or water features shall be incorporated into courtyard and plaza design. 
4.  Site furniture shall be carefully placed to not create pedestrian/vehicular conflicts. All outdoor seating areas shall leave at least five feet of unobstructed pedestrian space. 
5.  Graffiti resistant material and/or coating and skateboard deterrents shall be required to retain the furniture's attractiveness. 
6.  All outdoor dining furniture and umbrellas in the public right-of-way shall be removed and stored inside during hours of non-operation. 
H.  Parking and Circulation. 
1.  Customer and tenant parking shall be provided at the rear of buildings, in facilities, in off-street parking lots, or adjacent parking lots. Whenever possible, parking structures shall be placed behind the mixed use buildings. 
2.  Mixed-use projects must provide secure separate parking spaces for the residential units. The secure residential spaces shall be accessed via a gate code or other security mechanism. 
3.  Vehicular access shall be provided from side streets, adjacent alleys, and parallel streets whenever possible. 
4.  Where possible, rear parking lots shall be designed and located contiguously so vehicles can travel from one private parking lot to another without having to enter the street. This may be achieved with reciprocal access agreements. 
5.  The number of curb cuts for vehicular entry into the site shall be minimized so that pedestrian and bicycle areas are safe, secure, and passable. 
6.  Where possible, require abutting new developments to share a single access point from the road and allow only one curb cut per parcel. 
7.  Pedestrians shall have a clear and direct route from on-site parking to the building entry and public sidewalk system. The circulation path shall be direct, continuous, marked, and free of barriers (e.g., site equipment, signage, utility poles, etc.). 
8.  Any paving pattern, color, and material used to articulate pathways and pedestrian areas shall continue when driveways intersect with these areas. Where pedestrian circulation paths cross vehicular circulation paths, a material change, contrasting color, or slightly raised crossing shall be used to clearly delineate the continuing pedestrian path. 
9.  Adjacent properties shall be adequately screened from the parking structures and lots. 
10.  Secure, covered bicycle parking in residential mixed-use projects shall be provided. 
11.  Commercial bicycle racks shall be in public view, close to building entrances, with high visibility and sufficient lighting. 
12.  Include corner bulb-outs with gathering spaces and special crosswalks at key intersections. Considerations for gathering space components shall include shelter from sun and rain, seating options, landscaping (including shade trees and planters), trash receptacles, signage and fountains. 
I.  Landscaping. 
1.  Emphasis shall be placed on California or Mediterranean style landscaping, particularly indigenous plants, ornamental vines, and flowers in either container pots or as part of an arbor/trellis. Landscaping must be well maintained with drip irrigation systems for trees/garden beds and pots that does not drain across the pavement. 
2.  All landscaping shall employ features and techniques that reduce the demand for and consumption of water, including appropriate low-water plants, a high degree of paving permeability and water conserving irrigation techniques and systems. 
3.  Planting plans for building setbacks should include a hierarchy of plantings in terms of size and types of plant materials that mark the transition between the horizontal ground plane at the sidewalk or parking area and the tall, vertical facades of buildings. 
4.  Continuous street trees shall be included along all street frontages of mixed-use development. 
5.  Trees in paved areas shall be provided with "deep root" barriers, deep root automatic irrigation, and expandable metal tree grates of adequate size. Root barriers shall be of a material specifically designed for containing tree roots. Irrigation shall be adapted for deep watering. 
6.  For plazas, shade trees or other sun-screening elements shall be incorporated in the design to provide well-shaded seating areas. Decorative planters shall be considered for plazas. 
7.  Parking lots visible from the street and pedestrian areas shall incorporate landscaping treatments (e.g., trees, shrubs, groundcover, etc.). Larger parking lots shall also incorporate landscaped medians where appropriate. 
J.  Lighting. 
1.  Lighting fixtures shall be attractively designed to complement the architecture of the project, signify building entry locations, and improve visual identification of residences and businesses. 
2.  On each project site, all lighting fixtures shall be architecturally compatible with the buildings and from the same "family" with respect to design, materials, color, style, and color of light. 
3.  Wall mounted lights shall be used to the greatest extent possible to minimize the total number of freestanding light fixtures. 
4.  The lighting of building elements and garden walls is an effective and attractive lighting technique that should be considered. 
5.  In order to use less energy and reduce light pollution, ensure that lighting associated with new development or facilities (including street lighting, recreational facilities, and parking) shall be designed to prevent artificial lighting from illuminating adjacent residential neighborhoods and/or natural areas at a level greater than one foot candle above ambient conditions. 
K.  Walls. 
1.  Encourage alternatives to soundwalls and permit new soundwalls only where alternatives are not feasible. Along major arterials that coincide with a mixed use center, such as Kettleman Lane, ensure that soundwalls do not disrupt pedestrian-orientated character. Alternative designs could include frontage roads, dense vegetation, and ensuring sufficient insulation in residential units that would potentially be impacted by the noise. 
L.  Equipment, Service Area, and Refuse Area Screening. 
1.  Roof-mounted utility and communication equipment shall be screened from view by structural features that are an integral part of the building's architectural design. 
2.  Loading and service areas shall be concealed from view within the building envelope or shall be located to the rear of the site and designed for minimal visual impact and circulation conflicts. 
3.  When trash enclosures, loading docks, utility equipment, and similar uses are visible from a side street or a neighboring property, they shall be screened using materials, colors, and landscaping that are harmonious with the site design and building architecture. 
4.  Trash storage areas shall be covered to reduce unsightly views. 
5.  Trash enclosures shall provide an area for recycling.

17.22.070 - Mixed use corridor design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. The mixed use corridor design guidelines are intended to provide clear and useful recommendations for the design, construction, review, and approval of mixed use corridor development in the city of Lodi. Mixed Use Corridor development will play a vital role in reactivating key roadway corridors in the city through stimulation of new development along the corridors and interconnection of the corridors with surrounding neighborhoods. This chapter will help ensure that new projects will be well designed, uphold the city's vision, and contribute to the quality of the public realm. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The design guidelines in this chapter apply to the roadways designated as mixed use corridor in the general plan. Key corridors include Kettleman Lane, Cherokee Lane, Lodi Avenue, and Central Avenue. The design elements of each project (including site design, architecture, landscaping, parking design) will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis. 
2.  The review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
C.  Site Planning. 
1.  Special Standards for Lodi Avenue and Central Avenue. At least thirty percent of development site shall include active usesretail, restaurants, cafes, and personal service establishments fronting the streets at the ground level in order to accommodate pedestrian-oriented, neighborhood serving commercial uses. The minimum interior depth of these commercial spaces shall be twenty-five feet. A range of compatible uses, such as residential or office, may be located at upper levels and in portions not fronting the streets. 
2.  Special Standards for Kettleman Lane. Allow any mix of uses as permitted within the mixed use corridor classification. Ensure that residential uses are sited at upper levels or, if at ground level, then not directly facing the highly trafficked Kettleman Lane. 
3.  Special Standards for Cherokee Lane. Require any new development of site with mixed use designation south of Tokay Street to devote at least one-quarter of the built-up area to commercial uses, while allowing the full spectrum of single or mixed-uses permitted within the designation. 
D.  Building Placement. 
1.  Buildings shall be encouraged to locate near or along the front property line(s). 
2.  Variations in the zero setback from the property line(s) may be appropriate when the resulting setback provides greater accommodation for pedestrian circulation, sidewalk dining areas, enhanced entries, and improves the pedestrian realm. 
3.  When a front setback is necessary, a majority of the setback shall be hardscaped with limited landscaping to accommodate uses that keep the public realm active, such as outdoor dining and seating. 
E.  Building Orientation. 
1.  The main pedestrian access point to the building shall be located along the facade that is oriented to the primary street. 
2.  Buildings on corner lots shall have the primary entry facing the intersection. Corner entries help create an active public realm and reinforce significant street and sidewalk intersections. 
3.  Entries that face the primary street shall be directly connected to the street's sidewalks. Secondary and residential entrances can be connected to interior courtyards and parking lots. 
4.  The most active ground floor uses such as storefronts, lobbies, and restaurant dining areas shall front the public sidewalk. Private amenities, such as courtyards, that are not accessible to the public shall be located within the project site or on upper floors and not along the street. 
F.  Building Design and Architecture. 
1.  General Building Organization and Frontage Standards. 
a.  In mixed use corridors the development of a complex of buildings is preferable to a single large structure because the varied massing provides visual interest and human scale. Additionally, the spaces created between the various buildings provide opportunities for pedestrian plazas, courtyards and other outdoor gathering areas. 
b.  Building plans, facades, and architectural details shall create visual interest at the street level (e.g., staggering the frontage of the building, recessing doors and windows, providing awnings and canopies for weather protection and scale, and visually extending interior spaces outside through paving and glazing to create the concept of an indoor/outdoor room, etc.). 
c.  Projects located at intersections shall ensure the design treatments are continued around the corner. 
d.  Development located at signalized intersections of major streets shall be encouraged to include pedestrian-oriented, community serving commercial uses such as a bookstore, coffee shop, or local market. 
e.  Development located at key intersections, including Lodi Avenue/Central Avenue; Lodi Avenue/School Street; and Lodi Avenue/Sacramento Street, shall contain appropriate design features, including buildings that punctuate the corner with design elements and/or projects that provide additional public or pedestrian amenities, such as plazas. 
2.  Specific Building Organization and Frontage Standards for all Mixed Use Corridors except Kettleman Lane and Cherokee Lane. Maintain a consistent building base/street wall along the majority of site frontage along mixed use corridors (with the exception of Kettleman Lane and Cherokee Lane), with a minimum height of fifteen to twenty-five feet. 
3.  Articulation. 
a.  Where multiple-tenant spaces are incorporated into a building, individual tenant spaces shall be located within the building bays. This can be achieved by any of the following: 
i.  Placing a column, pier or pilaster between facade elements. 
ii.  Applying vertical slot or recess between facade elements. 
iii.  Providing variation in plane along the building wall. 
iv.  Varying the building wall by recessing the storefront entrance or creating a niche for landscaping or pedestrian area. 
b.  Primary building entries shall be accented with strong architectural definition. 
c.  Mixed use buildings shall be designed with a distinct "base", "middle", and "top" to create a human-scaled public realm. Elements that are recommended to articulate a building's facade include: 
i.  Design details for the top of a building, including cornice lines, parapets, eaves, brackets and other detailing. 
ii.  Design details for the body, or middle, of the building including windows, awnings, trellises, canopies, alcoves, balconies, pilasters, columns, decorative lighting and window boxes. 
iii.  Design details for the base of a building, including recessed entry areas, covered outdoor areas and alcoves. 
d.  The proportion and placement of windows on upper floors shall be designed to look different from the windows on the ground floor. 
e.  Awnings are encouraged, and if used, should be provided over each storefront of buildings with multiple storefronts. These awnings should be located within the individual structural bays and should not hide architectural detailing. 
f.  Awnings on multi-tenant buildings should be the same color and style and should be consistent with the character and design of the building. 
g.  In order to promote active, pedestrian-friendly streets, each individual tenant or business establishment and residential lobbies shall be oriented to and accessible from the major street frontage and directly accessible from the public sidewalk. 
h.  Rear walls and elevations visible from the public right-of-way shall be designed to maximize visual appeal by using vertical and horizontal wall plane breaks. 
4.  Roofs. 
a.  Roofs should be compatible with the architectural style of the building. 
b.  The roof shape should reflect the configuration of the building's mass and volume, and should be consistent in its character from all vantage points. 
c.  Sloping roof forms are encouraged. 
d.  The visible portion of sloped roofs shall be sheathed with a roofing material complementary to the architectural style of the building. 
e.  All buildings shall provide cornice or parapet detailing in order to delineate a strong roofline along the primary facades. 
f.  Cornices and horizontal bands of genuine materials, such as wood trim rather than foam are strongly encouraged. 
g.  False fronts, applied mansard forms and other artificial rooflines that are not an integral component of the architectural design should be avoided. 
5.  Building Materials. 
a.  A well-defined building "base" (i.e., ground floor) provides scale and articulation at the pedestrian level. The "base" shall consist of traditional thicker walls along with high quality, durable, and easy to clean materials and finishes. Special materials (e.g., granite, marble, polished stone, and other metal panels) shall be utilized as accent materials on the building's "base." 
b.  Upper floors that are less prone to potential vandalism shall utilize high quality finish materials of traditional mixed-use projects (e.g., brick veneer, smooth troweled stucco, etc.). 
c.  Materials and colors shall be selected to unify the building appearance and fit into the pedestrian context. Avoid overly vibrant colors and/or monochromatic color palettes. 
d.  Awning materials should be compatible with the overall design and character of the building. The use of fabric awnings is encouraged. The use of vinyl and plastic awnings is discouraged. 
6.  Windows. 
a.  Windows shall be large glazed panels, possibly with small upper transoms. Window patterns shall have a slight inset and not appear flat. Glass shall be clear (eighty-eight percent light transmission) and not heavily tinted so as to provide views into active spaces or window displays. 
b.  Thirty to sixty percent of linear store frontage at the street facade should be used for the display windows and evenly distributed. A higher percentage shall be encouraged for Lodi and Central Avenues, where higher pedestrian activity is expected. False fronts or windows should not be included that are not integral components of the building. 
c.  Windows on the upper floors shall be smaller in size than storefront windows on the first floor and shall encompass a smaller proportion of facade surface area. 
d.  Upper story windows shall be detailed with architectural elements, such as projecting sills, molded surrounds and/or lintels. 
e.  Where unique use or occupancy requirements preclude the addition of windows, such as theaters or parking structures, exterior walls shall be designed to provide architectural relief or shall be screened by landscaping and pedestrian amenities, such as trellises, benches or shade structures. 
f.  To ensure and protect the privacy of residents in adjacent single-family homes, windows in mixed-use projects facing single family residences within fifteen feet of the property line, shall be carefully arranged. Examples of privacy options include translucent or louvered windows, offset window patterns, and locating windows five-feet above the floor level. 
G.  Plazas. 
1.  Plazas shall incorporate high quality paving materials, such as stone, concrete or tile. The paving shall complement the adjacent public streetscape elements. 
2.  Plazas should be visible from public streets and the pedestrian network and accessible from the building as well as the street and pedestrian network. 
3.  Focal elements such as sculptures, art, or water features shall be incorporated into courtyard and plaza design. 
4.  Site furniture shall be carefully placed to not create pedestrian/vehicular conflicts. All outdoor seating areas shall leave at least five feet of unobstructed pedestrian space. 
5.  Graffiti resistant material and/or coating and skateboard deterrents shall be required to retain the furniture's attractiveness. 
6.  All outdoor dining furniture and umbrellas in the public right-of-way shall be removed and stored inside during hours of non-operation. 
H.  Parking and Circulation. 
1.  Customer and tenant parking shall be encouraged to be located at the rear of buildings, in facilities, in off-street parking lots, or adjacent parking lots. Whenever possible, parking shall be placed behind the mixed use buildings. 
2.  Mixed-use projects must provide secure separate parking spaces for the residential units. The secure residential spaces shall be accessed via a gate code or other security mechanism. 
3.  Vehicular access shall be provided from side streets, adjacent alleys, and parallel streets whenever possible. 
4.  Where possible, rear parking lots shall be designed and located contiguously so vehicles can travel from one private parking lot to another without having to enter the street. This may be achieved with reciprocal access agreements. 
5.  The number of curb cuts for vehicular entry into the site shall be minimized so that pedestrian and bicycle areas are safe, secure, and passable. 
6.  Where possible, require abutting new developments to share a single access point from the road and allow only one curb cut per parcel. 
7.  Pedestrians shall have a clear and direct route from on-site parking to the building entry and public sidewalk system. The circulation path shall be direct, continuous, marked, and free of barriers (e.g., site equipment, signage, utility poles, etc.). 
8.  Any paving pattern, color, and material used to articulate pathways and pedestrian areas shall continue when driveways intersect with these areas. Where pedestrian circulation paths cross vehicular circulation paths, a material change, contrasting color, or slightly raised crossing shall be used to clearly delineate the continuing pedestrian path. 
9.  Adjacent properties shall be adequately screened from the parking structures and lots. 
10.  Secure, covered bicycle parking in residential mixed-use projects shall be provided. 
11.  Commercial bicycle racks shall be in public view, close to building entrances, with high visibility and sufficient lighting. 
12.  Include bicycle lanes along mixed use corridors per Figure 5-3, general plan bicycle system, of the transportation element of the Lodi general plan.

Landscaping must be well maintained with drip irrigation systems for trees/garden beds and pots that does not drain across the pavement. 
2.  All landscaping shall employ features and techniques that reduce the demand for and consumption of water, including appropriate low-water plants, a high degree of paving permeability and water conserving irrigation techniques and systems. 
3.  Planting plans for building setbacks should include a hierarchy of plantings in terms of size and types of plant materials that mark the transition between the horizontal ground plane at the sidewalk or parking area and the tall, vertical facades of buildings. 
4.  Continuous street trees shall be included between the corridor roadway and sidewalk, unless infeasible. 
5.  Medians within corridor roadways shall be wide enough to act as refuges and support some landscaping, particularly at crossings. 
6.  Trees in paved areas shall be provided with "deep root" barriers, deep root automatic irrigation, and expandable metal tree grates of adequate size. Root barriers shall be of a material specifically designed for containing tree roots. Irrigation shall be adapted for deep watering. 
7.  For plazas, shade trees or other sun-screening elements shall be incorporated in the design to provide well-shaded seating areas. Decorative planters shall be considered for plazas. 
8.  Parking lots visible from the street and pedestrian areas shall incorporate landscaping treatments (e.g., trees, shrubs, groundcover, etc.). Larger parking lots that are not parking structures shall also incorporate landscaped medians where appropriate. 
J.  Lighting. 
1.  Lighting fixtures shall be attractively designed to complement the architecture of the project, signify building entry locations, and improve visual identification of residences and businesses. 
2.  On each project site, all lighting fixtures shall be architecturally compatible with the buildings and from the same "family" with respect to design, materials, color, style, and color of light.

17.24.050 - Industrial design guidelines. 
A.  Purpose. The industrial design guidelines are intended to provide clear and useful recommendations for the design, construction, review, and approval of industrial development in the city of Lodi. The city of Lodi recognizes the unique requirements of industrial development and the potential for such development, through careful design, to make a positive contribution to the appearance of the community. Site and building design provisions herein are focused on the view from public rights-of-way and compatibility with surrounding development. This chapter will help ensure that new projects will be well designed, uphold the city's vision, and contribute to the quality of the public realm. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The design guidelines in this chapter apply to the sites designated as industrial in the general plan. The general plan industrial land use designation includes the general mills factory and sites along the railroad and east of State Route 99. The design elements of each project (including site design, architecture, landscaping, parking design) will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis. 
2.  The review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case. The overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed. 
C.  Building Orientation. 
1.  Design industrial sites to minimize the visual impacts of parking areas, equipment, and outdoor storage from public rights-of-way. Mitigate these undesirable visual impacts through proper placement and design of buildings, screen walls, and landscaping. 
2.  New buildings shall be oriented toward the adjoining public streets, so that public entrances are a focal point on the building and site layout. 
3.  Industrial buildings shall be oriented so that bays and loading docks do not directly face the primary street frontage. Loading areas shall be located in the rear or side of the building whenever possible; however, they should never face adjacent residential uses. 
D.  Building Design and Architecture. 
1.  Massing and Scale. 
a.  Organize the massing of larger buildings into components that more readily relate to the human scale. 
b.  Reduce the mass and scale of large industrial buildings with building facades and wall height variations, and by articulating rooflines and wall planes. 
c.  Avoid long, repetitive, monotonous facades particularly those that repeat the same design element several times along the same elevation. 
d.  The scale of building(s) on the site edge shall be compatible with the scale of adjoining development. Where surrounding development is of a small scale, large scale buildings shall be located internal to the site and transition down in scale as the outer edge of the site approaches. 
2.  Articulation and Detail. 
a.  Individual design elements shall be faithful to the overall architecture of the building. Architectural details shall be part of the design and not something applied as an afterthought. A consistent design theme provides continuity and avoids confusion of style. 
b.  Front and street-side facades of large buildings visible from a public street or adjacent residential property shall include architectural features such as reveals, windows and openings, trellises, changes in color, texture, and material to add interest to the building elevation and reduce its visual mass. 
c.  Consideration shall be given to recessing building floors above the first story and providing vertical or horizontal offsets in the wall surfaces at regular intervals, including columns, projections, and recesses, (e.g. every twenty feet). 
d.  All sides of the building visible from the street or residential property shall have the same level of architectural detailing as the main elevation. 
e.  Primary building entries shall have pedestrian scale and shall be expressed with windows, awnings, trellises, articulation, arcades, landscape, planters, and material changes or other design elements so that the building entry is easily identified and visible from the street and parking lot. 
f.  Architectural detail at the street level shall establish human scale and enhance the building's and the streetscape's appearance. 
3.  Roofs. 
a.  Roofs shall be compatible with the architectural style and scale of the building. 
b.  The roof shape shall reflect the configuration of the building's mass and volume, and shall be consistent in its character where visible from public streets. 
c.  Rooflines for large buildings shall be broken up and varied by providing change in the height of a portion of the roof(s), change in form, or other articulations. High pitched "A-frame" type rooflines and partial mansards should be avoided. 
4.  Building Materials and Colors. 
a.  Innovative use of durable, high quality materials such as brick, stone, tile, stucco, and concrete is encouraged. 
b.  Incorporation of energy conservation features is encouraged in industrial buildings to exceed California's 2005 Title 24 regulation standards for building energy efficiency. 
c.  Use a color scheme (for example: two analogous colors plus a complementary trim color) to create visual interest and enhance the streetscape appearance of the building. 
d.  Use earthtone colors and keep the number of colors used on the building and within the overall streetscape to a minimum. 
e.  Use smaller, articulated, varied color and texture wall surfaces rather than larger homogenous ones. 
f.  The same exterior colors and finishes shall be used on all sides of the structure. 
g.  Building color shall not be used as signage, branding, or business identification. 
h.  Awning materials shall be compatible with the overall design and character of the building. The use of fabric awnings is encouraged. The use of vinyl and plastic awnings is discouraged. 
E.  Parking and Circulation. 
1.  Site access shall allow for easy circulation throughout the project to minimize conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians, between employee/visitor traffic and truck shipping/delivery. Separate walkways shall be provided to the public way from the main entrance. Main pedestrian routes through parking areas to building entrances shall have decorative paving treatment or other demarcation of pedestrian right-of-way. 
2.  Enhance primary entry drives for automobiles, especially visitors, with ornamental landscaping, special treatment, and monument type signs to communicate site access locations. 
3.  Parking lots shall not be the dominant visual element of the site. It is generally more visually appealing to locate parking lots along the side or the rear of buildings. Small customer-oriented parking lots are appropriate toward the front of the site; however, the majority of employee parking should be located to the rear of the site to the maximum extent feasible. To avoid large expanses of paved areas, large parking lots should be divided into smaller parking areas. Buildings should not be located in a manner that make them appear like "islands" surrounded by paved areas. 
4.  The number of site accesses (ingress/egress) shall be controlled in terms of the location and number of driveways to minimize traffic safety conflicts, street congestion, and unnecessarily disrupted street frontage. Where possible, adjoining properties should share access driveways to minimize the number of driveways along public streets. Shared service or secondary access alleys shall also be considered. Use of an existing side street for primary or secondary access is encouraged as opposed to creating one or more new curb cuts on a collector or arterial street. 
5.  New streets for industrial projects shall be designed to handle heavier loads associated with truck operations, as necessary. Larger turning movements shall also be included in new streets to facilitate truck movements. 
F.  Landscaping. 
1.  Emphasis shall be placed on California or Mediterranean style landscaping, particularly indigenous plants, ornamental vines, and flowers in either container pots or as part of an arbor/trellis. Landscaping must be well maintained with drip irrigation systems for trees/garden beds and pots that do not drain across the pavement. 
2.  All landscaping shall employ features and techniques that reduce the demand for and consumption of water, including appropriate low-water plants, a high degree of paving permeability and water conserving irrigation techniques and systems. Recycled water should be utilized to the extent possible. 
3.  Trees in paved areas shall be provided with "deep root" barriers, deep root automatic irrigation, and expandable metal tree grates of adequate size. Root barriers shall be of a material specifically designed for containing tree roots. Irrigation shall be adapted for deep watering. 
4.  Planting plans for building setbacks should include a hierarchy of plantings in terms of size and types of plant materials that mark the transition between the horizontal ground plane at the sidewalk or parking area and the tall, vertical facades of buildings. 
5.  The use of vines, trellises, and landscape screen walls is strongly encouraged on larger areas of unadorned building facades to soften the appearance and to deter graffiti. 
6.  Increase the amount of landscaping and special landscape features at project entries and pedestrian gathering areas. 
7.  Minimize the quantity of impervious paving in parking areas and maximize the use of landscaping or permeable pavement on-site to reduce surface water runoff and the need for water detention basins. 
8.  Where it is infeasible to locate all large parking areas to the rear of the building, views of expansive paved areas from public rights-of-way and/or residential areas shall be minimized by landscaping within and along the perimeter of parking lots. 
9.  Required parking lot landscaping shall include the use of landscape planters along parking aisles throughout the parking lot. 
10.  Streetscapes shall incorporate a mix of trees, shrubbery, and ground cover to establish a landscape corridor presence. 
11.  Consideration shall be given to the incorporation of open space areas in the form of courtyards, plazas, shaded arcades and functional landscaped areas. These features should link adjoining buildings and take advantage of outdoor as well as indoor space. These features can be located in areas with recessed facades or setbacks in excess of minimum standards, and may be designed for use by employees and/or customers. Pedestrian features such as benches, tables, fountains, artwork, and landscaping should be incorporated as focal points or relaxation area. 
G.  Lighting. 
1.  The design and location of outdoor lighting fixtures shall preclude direct glare onto adjoining non-industrial property and streets. 
2.  Outdoor lighting shall be designed to foster security. Illumination should be increased at building entries to increase visibility and safety. 
3.  Use landscape lighting and exterior lighting to enhance project design features. Lighting fixtures shall have sharp cut off so that no direct lighting falls onto adjacent properties or the public right-of-way. 
4.  As applicable, illuminate flags only with very narrow spot type lamps directed no more than fifteen degrees from vertical. Shield fixtures so that the light source is not visible from off-site. 
H.  Equipment, Service Area, and Refuse Area Screening. 
1.  Roof-mounted utility and communication equipment shall be screened from view by structural features that are an integral part of the building's architectural design. 
2.  Loading and service areas shall be concealed from view within the building envelope or shall be located to the rear of the site and designed for minimal visual impact and circulation conflicts. 
3.  When trash enclosures, loading docks, utility equipment, and similar uses are visible from a street, they shall be screened using materials, colors, and landscaping that are harmonious with the site design and building architecture. 
4.  Trash enclosures shall provide an area for recycling. 
I.  Metal Buildings. Metal buildings present their own special set of challenges and opportunities in the community context. If metal buildings are well articulated and surfaces are judiciously mixed with other materials, or textures, and colors, they can make an attractive contribution to industrial park appearance. 
1.  Metal buildings should incorporate architectural features such as gable, hip, and other sloping roof forms, prominent main entries, windows, storefront, glazed doors, canopies and window awnings, use of brick or stone at building base, and architectural lighting fixtures to make a positive contribution to the streetscape. 
2.  Street frontages of metal buildings shall present sloping or articulated roof forms. Eaves and steeper roof pitches are more attractive than shallow roofs and roofs without eaves. 
3.  As with all building design, roofs, particularly metal roofs, contribute significantly to a building's appearance and character. Variety in roof shapes and colors should complement the scale of the building. Darker, non-glare colors help reduce the mass of metal roof designs. Metal roofs can incorporate standing seam, tile and shake materials to create visual interest in design. 
4.  Long, stark, and uninterrupted panels used for metal buildings shall be avoided. Use of panels with continuous vertical seams shall also be avoided. Other building materials should be incorporated into structural design to add contrast, variety, and visual interest in building form. Wall systems should use techniques that hide or disguise wall fastening systems and seams. Building features such as columns, curved metal corners, deep reveals at construction joints or other details should be incorporated into building design to add interest into the architectural design. 
5.  Window treatments can provide a key design element for metal buildings. Windows shall particularly be incorporated along the street front elevation(s) to help metal buildings incorporate human-scale design elements that address the building to the street. Windows should incorporate changes in building plane by either recessing or projecting them as integral parts of the overall design theme. Detailed window fenestration should be incorporated around windows including change in relief, color, pattern, and/or materials. 
6.  Downspouts shall be concealed unless they are part of the design, in which case downspouts shall be coated to match the wall color. 
7.  Any freestanding outbuildings shall use forms, shapes and materials that are consistent with the main structure. 
8.  Large expanses of light colored metal wall materials shall be avoided. Darker colors help visually reduce the prominence of large metal buildings. Horizontal color bands, and wall projections and recesses, provide shadowing to accentuate differentiation for wall designs. Consider using corrugated or flat fiber-reinforced cement panels, as well as metal.

17.26.040 - Public and community facilities district development standards. 
Standards for development within the PF zoning district will be determined by the city through the project review process. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
Chapter 17.28 - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS 
 
17.28.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter regulates new and existing structures and land uses in the overlay zoning districts established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established). The provisions of this chapter provide guidance for development in addition to the standards and regulations of the primary zoning districts, where important site, environmental, safety, compatibility, or design issues require particular attention in project planning. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.28.020 - Applicability of overlay zoning districts. 
The provisions of this chapter apply to proposed land uses and development in addition to all other applicable requirements of this development code. Any perceived conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other provision of this development code shall be resolved in compliance with Section 17.02.020(D). 
A.  Mapping of Overlay Districts. The applicability of any overlay zoning district to a specific site is shown by the overlay zoning map symbol established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established), being appended as a suffix to the symbol for the primary zoning district on the zoning map. The overlay districts are applied to property through the rezoning process (Chapter 17.72). 
B.  Allowed land uses, permit requirements, development standards. Except as may be otherwise provided by this chapter for a specific overlay district: 
1.  Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district by this article may be allowed within an overlay district, subject to any additional requirements of the overlay district; 
2.  Development and new land uses within an overlay district shall obtain the land use permits required by this article for the primary zoning district; and 
3.  Development and new land uses within an overlay district shall comply with all applicable development standards of the primary zoning district, except as modified by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.28.030 - Flood hazard (-F) overlay zoning district. 
A.  Purpose. The -F overlay district is intended to protect people and property from flood hazard risks by appropriately regulating development and land uses within areas subject to flooding. Special regulation is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and general welfare, and of property and improvements from hazards and damage resulting from floodwaters and to promote the open space conservation element policies of the general plan. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Application to Property. The -F overlay district is applied to areas within the city prone to flood hazard risks, combined with any primary zoning district as shown on the zoning map and by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established). 
2.  Floodplain Boundaries. The Mokelumne River floodplain is defined as those areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration through a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Lodi," dated June, 1987, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and any revision thereto, which are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section. Maps and data which reflect this delineation are on file in the office of the director of community development. 
C.  Permit Requirements. No structure or land shall, after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, be located, extended, converted or altered within the -F overlay zoning district without full compliance with the terms of this chapter, and without having first received a development or construction permit in accordance with the provisions of this title and, for developments requiring use permits, with the provisions of Section 17.12.030. 
D.  Allowable Land Uses. Nothing in this subsection is intended to authorize a use not otherwise allowed in the primary zoning district with which the -F overlay district is combined. 
1.  Permitted Uses Generally. Unless otherwise prohibited or subject to a use permit in the primary zoning district, the following uses are permitted without a use permit where modification or removal of native vegetation, including trees, is not required: 
a.  Agriculture; 
b.  Open space agricultural uses not requiring a closed building such as, orchards, and livestock feeding and grazing; 
c.  The storage of farm machinery which is readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning; 
d.  Recreational: Firmly anchored recreational floating docks; and 
e.  Modification of Native Vegetation: Where modification or removal native vegetation is required, such modification or removal may be after obtaining a development permit consisting of written approval from the community development director; provided, that such modifications in the floodplain have been found to be consistent with the general plan. 
2.  Permitted UsesUse Permit and State Approval. Unless otherwise prohibited in the primary zoning district, the following uses may be permitted after approval of a conditional use permit by the city and after approval by the State Department of Fish and Game and the reclamation board of the state; provided, that as determined by said reclamation board, a combination of such uses within the floodplain does not materially increase the flood height of the intermediate regional floodplain; and provided further, that as determined by the State Department of Fish and Game, full mitigation measures will be used to protect and enhance the trees, native plant materials and wildlife in the floodplain, in accordance with good fish and game practices and in accordance with the following: 
a.  Residential dwellings on existing undeveloped lots in subdivisions approved before January 1, 1977; 
b.  Outdoor recreational facilities: 
i.  Campgrounds; 
ii.  Boating facilities; 
iii.  Parks; 
iv.  Golf courses or driving ranges; 
v.  Athletic fields; and 
vi.  Shooting ranges; 
c.  Fences, fills, walls, excavations or other appurtenances which do not constitute an obstruction or debris-catching obstacle to the passage of floodwaters and which are consistent with the open space-conservation element policies; 
d.  Private drives, bridges, and public utility wires and pipelines for transmission and distribution; 
e.  Improvements in stream channel alignment, cross-section and capacity, including modification of riverbank and flood protection levees; 
f.  Structures that are designed to have a minimum effect upon the flow of water and are firmly anchored to prevent the structure from flotation (excepting floating docks); provided, that no structures for human habitation is permitted; 
g.  Other similar uses of a type not appreciably damaged by floodwaters. 
3.  Prohibited UsesStorage or Processing. The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable or explosive, or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, is prohibited. 
E.  Development Standards. In all areas zoned in the -F overlay district, the provisions set out in subsections 1 through 6 are required. 
1.  Elevation of Lowest Floor. The lowest floor of any residential structure, including garages and accessory buildings, shall be elevated eighteen inches or more above the level of the base flood elevation. 
2.  Anchorage. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
3.  Construction Practices and Materials. All new construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
4.  Water and sewer systems. New and replacement water and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
5.  Nonresidential Structures. New nonresidential structures shall be floodproofed or elevated eighteen inches or more above the level of the base flood. 
6.  Floodproofing. All structures requiring floodproofing shall be so designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads with effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this section are satisfied and a copy of such certification shall be provided to the director of public works and the chief building inspector. 
F.  WarningLiability Denied. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.28.040 - Planned development (-PD) overlay zoning district. 
A.  Purpose. The -PD overlay district is intended to identify areas where the city has determined that flexibility in the application of development standards will produce development projects of superior quality, including retention of unique site characteristics, creative and efficient project design, etc., than would have been achieved through strict application of the development standards required by the primary zoning district. The -PD zoning district is consistent with all land use designations of the general plan. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Eligible Primary Districts. The -PD overlay district may be combined with any of the residential, commercial, or industrial zoning districts established by Section 17.10.020 (Zoning Districts Established). 
2.  Minimum Site Area for District. The -PD overlay zoning district shall only be applied to sites of five acres or larger. 
C.  Permit Requirements. Planned Development Permit approval (Section 17.40.060) shall be required for all development and new land uses except the interim land uses allowed by subsection D below. A planned development permit application must be simultaneously submitted with an application for rezoning to apply the -PD overlay zoning district, where rezoning is initiated by a property owner. 
D.  Allowable Land Uses. Any land use normally allowed by this article in the applicable primary zoning district may be authorized within the -PD overlay district through the planned development permit. Prior to the approval of a planned development permit, allowable uses shall be limited to the following: 
1.  Interim UsesResidential Districts. When the -PD overlay is combined with a residential zoning district, a site may be used for any of the agricultural, resource, and open space uses identified as permitted by Table 2-4. With use permit approval, a site may be used for these temporary, short-term activities involving no physical improvements to the site. 
2.  Interim UsesCommercial Districts. When the -PD overlay is combined with a commercial zoning district, a site may be used in advance of planned development permit approval only for temporary, short-term activities involving no physical improvements to the site, when authorized by use permit approval. 
3.  Interim UsesIndustrial Districts. When the -PD overlay is combined with a industrial zoning district, a site may be used in advance of Planned Development Permit approval only for temporary, short-term activities involving no physical improvements to the site, when authorized by use permit approval. 
E.  Development Standards. Proposed development and new land uses shall comply with all development standards established by the applicable planned development permit, or previous master plan and precise development plan, in addition to the requirements of the primary zoning district, and the applicable development standards (e.g., landscaping, parking and loading, etc.) in Article 3 (Site Planning and General Development Standards). 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
ARTICLE 3. - SITE PLANNING AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS  
Chapter 17.30 - LANDSCAPING 
 
17.30.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, safety, and welfare by: 
A.  Preserving and enhancing the visual character of the community, and providing cooling shade; 
B.  Enhancing well-designed structures and increasing compatibility between abutting land uses and public rights-of-way by providing landscape screening and buffers; and 
C.  Provide for the conservation and safeguard of water resources through the efficient use of water, appropriate use of plant materials, and regular maintenance of landscaped areas. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.30.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Landscaping Required. The provisions of this chapter apply to all new proposed development. An addition to a structure that is twenty-five percent or more of the floor area of the existing structure, and any change of use, shall require that the entire parcel be brought into compliance with the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an existing use, if the amount of required landscaping cannot be accommodated because of physical constraints on the site, (e.g., structures, parking, circulation, etc.) the applicant shall provide whatever additional landscaping the site can accommodate towards meeting the landscape requirements of this chapter. 
B.  Other Requirements. Standards for the provision of landscaping within the public right-of-way are located in Article 5 (Subdivisions). 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.30.030 - Landscape plan approval requirements. 
A.  Preliminary Landscape Plan. A preliminary landscape plan shall be submitted as part of an application for a land use entitlement for new development, except for single family on individual lots, or the significant expansion or redevelopment of an existing use as determined by the director. 
B.  Final Landscape Plan. Following approval of the land use entitlement, a final landscape plan shall be submitted as part of the application for a building permit. Final plans shall be approved by the director prior to the start of on-site construction or soil disturbance and prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
C.  Content. Preliminary landscape plans and final landscape plans shall contain information as specified in the instructions for preparing landscape plans provided by the department. 
D.  Review and Approval. After initial application, the director shall review each preliminary landscape plan and final landscape plan to verify its compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The director may approve the submittal in compliance with this chapter, or may disapprove or require changes to a submittal if it is not in compliance. 
E.  Statement of Surety. When required by the director, a statement of surety in the form of cash, performance bond, letter of credit, or certificate of deposit, in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the total value of all plant materials, irrigation, installation, and maintenance shall be posted with the city for a two-year period. The director may require statements of surety for phased development projects, a legitimate delay in landscape installation due to seasonal requirements (including adverse weather conditions) and similar circumstances where it may not be advisable or desirable to install all of a project's landscaping before occupancy of the site. 
F.  Minor Changes to Approved Plans. Landscape plan approval may include the director authorizing minor changes from the requirements of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.30.040 - Landscape location requirements. 
Landscaping shall be provided in the locations specified below except for single-family uses. 
A.  Setbacks. All setback and open space areas required by this development code, and easements for utilities, and drainage courses shall be landscaped, except where it is determined by the director that landscaping is not necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. 
B.  Unused Areas. All areas of a project site not intended for a specific use, including pad sites in shopping centers held for future development, shall be landscaped unless it is determined by the director that landscaping is not necessary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. 
C.  Parking Areas. Parking areas shall be landscaped in compliance with the following requirements: 
1.  Landscape Materials. Landscaping materials shall be provided throughout the parking lot area using a combination of trees, shrubs, and ground cover. 
2.  Curbing. Areas containing plant materials shall be bordered by a concrete curb at least six inches high and six inches wide. Alternative barrier design to protect landscaped areas from damage by vehicles may be approved by the director. 
3.  Location of Landscaping. Parking lot landscaping shall be located so that pedestrians are not required to cross landscaped areas to reach building entrances from parked cars. This should be achieved through proper orientation of the landscaped fingers and islands. 
4.  Bumper Overhang Areas. To increase the parking lot landscaped area, a maximum of two feet of the parking stall depth may be landscaped with low-growth, hearty materials in lieu of paving, allowing a two-foot bumper overhang while maintaining the required parking dimensions. 
5.  Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping. 
a.  Adjacent to Streets. Parking areas for nonresidential uses adjoining a public street shall be designed to provide a landscaped planting strip between the street right-of-way and parking area equal in depth to the setback required by the zoning district or ten feet, whichever is greater. Required parking areas for residential uses shall not be located within the required setback areas. 
The landscaping shall be designed and maintained to screen cars from view from the street and shall be a height of between thirty and forty-two inches. Screening materials may include a combination of plant materials, earth berms, solid masonry walls, raised planters, or other screening devices to meet the intent of this requirement. Shade trees shall be provided at a minimum rate of one for every thirty linear feet of landscaped area. 
b.  Adjacent to Side or Rear Property Lines. Parking areas for nonresidential uses shall provide a perimeter landscaped strip at least five feet wide (inside dimension) where the facility adjoins a side or rear property line. The perimeter landscaped strip may include a required yard or buffer area. Trees shall be provided at the rate of one for each thirty linear feet of landscaped area. 
c.  Adjacent to Structures. When parking areas are located adjacent to nonresidential structures, a minimum five-foot wide landscape strip shall be provided adjacent to the structure. 
d.  Adjacent to Residential Use. Parking areas for nonresidential uses adjoining residential uses shall provide a landscaped buffer yard with a minimum ten-foot width between the parking area and the common property line bordering the residential use. A solid masonry wall or fence and landscape buffer shall be provided along the property line to address land use compatibility issues such as nuisance noise and light or glare. Trees shall be provided at the rate of one for each thirty linear feet of landscaped area. 
6.  Interior Parking Lot Landscaping. 
a.  Minimum Area of Landscaping. A minimum of five percent of the total off-street parking area shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, and ground cover. The perimeter landscaping required by subsection (C)(5) of this section shall not be considered part of the required parking lot landscaping. 
b.  Planter Dimensions. Planters with trees shall have a minimum interior dimension of five feet. All ends of parking lanes shall be separated from drive aisles by landscaped islands or other means approved by the director. 
c.  Larger Projects. Parking lots with more than one hundred fifty spaces shall provide a concentration of landscape elements at primary entrances, including specimen trees, flowering plants, and enhanced paving. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)

J.  Irrigation Design Plan. 
1.  This section applies to landscaped areas requiring permanent irrigation, not areas that require temporary irrigation solely for the plant establishment period. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the manufacturers' recommendations. The irrigation system and its related components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation, management, and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following design criteria shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation package. 
a.  System. 
i.  Landscape water meters, defined as either a dedicated water service meter or private submeter, shall be installed for all non-residential irrigated landscapes of one thousand square feet but not more than five thousand square feet (the level at which Water Code Section 535 applies) and residential irrigated landscapes of five thousand square feet or greater. A landscape water meter may be either: 
(A)  A customer service meter dedicated to landscape use provided by the local water purveyor; or 
(B)  A privately-owned meter or submeter. 
ii.  Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data utilizing non-volatile memory shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems. 
iii.  If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each emission device is within the manufacturer's recommended pressure range for optimal performance. 
(A)  If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices such as inline pressure regulators, booster pumps, or other devices shall be installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system. 
(B)  Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure, and flow reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection. These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage. If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements shall be conducted at installation. 
iv.  Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, etc.), either integral or auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided during windy or freezing weather or during rain. 
v.  Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve, or butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair. 
vi.  Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant shall refer to the applicable city code (i.e., public health) for additional backflow prevention requirements. 
vii.  Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system damage or malfunction are required for all non-residential landscapes and residential landscapes of five thousand square feet or larger. 
viii.  Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual control of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped with low-pressure shut-down features. 
ix.  The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures. 
x.  Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as soil type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation systems. 
xi.  The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the hydrozones of the landscape design plan. 
xii.  The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet, at a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria as described in Section 17.30.070G. regarding the maximum applied water allowance. 
xiii.  All irrigation emission devices must meet the requirements set in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers'/International Code Council's (ASABE/ICC) 802-2014 "Landscape Irrigation Sprinkler and Emitter Standard." All sprinkler heads installed in the landscape must document a distribution uniformity low quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol defined in ASABE/ICC 802-2014. 
xiv.  It is highly recommended that the project applicant or city inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact the effectiveness of the irrigation system. 
xv.  In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone. 
xvi.  Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's recommendations. 
xvii.  Head-to-head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution uniformity using the manufacturer's recommendations. 
xviii.  Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to hardscapes or in high traffic areas of turfgrass. 
xix.  Check valves or anti-drain valves are required systems on all sprinkler heads where low point drainage could occur. 
xx.  Areas less than ten feet in width in any direction shall be irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produce no runoff or overspray. 
xxi.  Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel, or other porous material. These restrictions may be modified if: 
(A)  The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; 
(B)  The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or 
(C)  The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package and clearly demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in Section 17.30.070J.1.a.ix. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during the irrigation audit. 
xxii.  Slopes greater than twenty-five percent shall not be irrigated with an irrigation system with an application rate exceeding 0.75 inches per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape designer specifies an alternative design or technology, as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during the irrigation audit. 
b.  Hydrozone. 
i.  Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope, sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use. 
ii.  Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone. 
iii.  Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from shrubs, groundcovers, and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of trees. The mature size and extent of the root zone shall be considered when designing irrigation for trees. 
iv.  Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if: 
(A)  Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the respective plant water uses and their plant factor; or 
(B)  The plant factor of the higher water using plant is used for calculations. 
v.  Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants shall not be permitted. 
vi.  On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan, hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter, or other designation. On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve, and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the Hydrozone Information Table (see California Code of Regulations Title 23, Chapter 2.7, § 495 Appendix B, Section A). This table can also assist with the irrigation audit and programming the controller. 
2.  The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain: 
a.  Location and size of separate water meters for landscape; 
b.  Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler heads, moisture sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure regulators, and backflow prevention devices;

Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and grading design plans to minimize rainwater runoff and to increase on-site retention and infiltration are encouraged. 
2.  Project applicants shall refer to the city or regional water quality control board for information on any applicable stormwater technical requirements. 
3.  All planted landscape areas are required to have friable soil to maximize water retention and infiltration. Refer to California Code of Regulations Title 23, Chapter 2.7, § 492.6(a). 
4.  It is strongly recommended that landscape areas be designed for capture and infiltration capacity that is sufficient to prevent runoff from impervious surfaces (i.e., roof and paved areas) from either: (1) the one inch, twenty-four-hour rain event or (2) the eighty-fifth percentile, twenty-four-hour rain event, and/or additional capacity as required by any applicable local, regional, state or federal regulation. 
5.  It is recommended that storm water projects incorporate any of the following elements to improve on-site storm water and dry weather runoff capture and use: 
a.  Grade impervious surfaces, such as driveways, during construction to drain to vegetated areas. 
b.  Minimize the area of impervious surfaces such as paved areas, roof and concrete driveways. 
c.  Incorporate pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., gravel, permeable pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete) that minimize runoff. 
d.  Direct runoff from paved surfaces and roof areas into planting beds or landscaped areas to maximize site water capture and reuse. 
e.  Incorporate rain gardens, cisterns, and other rain harvesting or catchment systems. 
f.  Incorporate infiltration beds, swales, basins and drywells to capture storm water and dry weather runoff and increase percolation into the soil. 
g.  Consider constructed wetlands and ponds that retain water, equalize excess flow, and filter pollutants. 
T.  Public Education. 
1.  Publications. Education is a critical component to promote the efficient use of water in landscapes. The use of appropriate principles of design, installation, management and maintenance that save water is encouraged in the community. 
a.  The city shall provide information to owners of permitted renovations and new, single-family residential homes regarding the design, installation, management, and maintenance of water efficient landscapes based on a water budget. 
2.  Model Homes. All model homes shall be landscaped and use signs and written information to demonstrate the principles of water efficient landscapes described in this title. 
a.  Signs shall be used to identify the model as an example of a water efficient landscape featuring elements such as hydrozones, irrigation equipment, and others that contribute to the overall water efficient theme. Signage shall include information about the site water use as designed per the local ordinance; specify who designed and installed the water efficient landscape; and demonstrate low water use approaches to landscaping such as using native plants, graywater systems, and rainwater catchment systems. 
b.  Information shall be provided about designing, installing, managing, and maintaining water efficient landscapes. 
U.  Provisions for Existing Landscapes. The city may by mutual agreement designate another agency, such as a water purveyor, to implement some or all of the requirements contained in this title.

V.  Irrigation Audit, Irrigation Survey, and Irrigation Water Use Analysis. 
1.  This section shall apply to all existing landscapes that were installed before December 1, 2015 and are over one acre in size. 
a.  For all landscapes that have a water meter, the city shall administer programs that may include, but not be limited to, irrigation water use analyses, irrigation surveys, and irrigation audits to evaluate water use and provide recommendations as necessary to reduce landscape water use to a level that does not exceed the maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes. The maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes shall be calculated as: MAWA = (0.8) (ETo)(LA)(0.62). 
b.  For all landscapes that do not have a meter, the city shall administer programs that may include, but not be limited to, irrigation surveys and irrigation audits to evaluate water use and provide recommendations as necessary in order to prevent water waste. 
2.  All landscape irrigation audits shall be conducted by a certified landscape irrigation auditor. 
W.  Water Waste Prevention. 
1.  The city shall prevent water waste resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation by prohibiting runoff from leaving the target landscape due to low head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, non-irrigated areas, walks, roadways, parking lots, or structures. Penalties for violation of these prohibitions shall be established locally. 
2.  Restrictions regarding overspray and runoff may be modified if: 
a.  The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no runoff occurs; or 
b.  The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and constructed to drain entirely to landscaping. 
X.  Effective Precipitation. The city considers effective precipitation (twenty-five percent of annual precipitation) in tracking water use and uses the following equation to calculate maximum applied water allowance: 
MAWA= (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.7 x LA) + (0.3 x SLA)] for residential areas. 
MAWA= (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for non-residential areas.

17.32.050 - Adjustments to parking requirements. 
Where two or more adjacent nonresidential uses have distinct and differing peak parking usage periods, (e.g. a theater and a bank), a reduction in the required number of parking spaces may be allowed through use permit approval. Approval shall also require a recorded covenant running with the land, recorded by the owner of the parking lot, guaranteeing that the required parking will be maintained exclusively for the use served for the duration of the use. 
A.  Reduction of required parking. The review authority may reduce the number of parking spaces required through the granting of a use permit in compliance with the following: 
1.  Quantitative information provided by the applicant that documents the need for fewer spaces (e.g., sales receipts, documentation of customer frequency, information on parking standards required for the proposed land use by other cities, etc.); 
2.  The use or project design creates an integrated whole wherein the parking reduction will not adversely affect other businesses or uses on the same property or within the boundaries of the project; or 
3.  The proposed parking requirement is consistent with other uses of similar intensity established elsewhere in the parking regulations and does not represent a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the intent of the parking regulations to provide adequate and consistent levels of parking for similar uses throughout the city. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)

(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.32.100 - Loading space standards. 
Loading spaces shall be designed and constructed as follows: 
A.  Location. Loading spaces shall be located based on the operating characteristics of the proposed use: 
1.  As near as possible to the main structure and limited to the rear two-thirds of the parcel, if feasible; 
2.  Loading facilities shall be discouraged from facing streets. Where not possible to do otherwise, ensure that the loading facility is screened from adjacent streets as much as possible; 
3.  To ensure that loading and unloading takes place on-site and in no case within adjacent public rights-of-way or other traffic areas on-site; 
4.  To ensure that vehicular maneuvers occur on-site; and 
5.  To avoid adverse impacts upon neighboring residential properties. 
B.  Dimensions. Loading spaces shall be not less than twelve feet in width, forty-five feet in length, with fourteen feet of vertical clearance.

(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.32.110 - Parking and circulation design guidelines. 
A.  General Design Considerations. The primary design considerations for parking lot layout and site access are safety and efficiency, minimizing the visual impact of large paved areas, reinforcing the street environment, integrating parking into overall site development, and maximizing pedestrian orientation by means of lighting, landscape, hardscape, and parking layout. 
1.  Factors to Consider. The following factors should be considered in the design and development of off-street parking areas: 
a.  Ingress and egress with consideration to possible conflicts with vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
b.  Intra-parking lot pedestrian and vehicular conflicts; 
c.  Reinforcing the street edge and a pedestrian environment; 
d.  On-site circulation and service vehicle zones; 
e.  Overall configuration and appearance of the parking area; 
f.  Promoting compatibility with adjacent land uses; 
g.  Minimizing opportunities for crime and undesirable activities through natural surveillance, access control and activity support; 
h.  Potential to connect parking lot with neighboring properties; 
i.  Shading the parking lot by means of canopy trees and other landscaping; 
j.  Creating a sense of spatial organization and experiential meaning through the layout of the design of the parking lot; 
k.  Reducing heat gain by shading pavement and employing light-colored pavement and walls; and 
l.  Maximizing on-site percolation and minimizing runoff to storm drains. 
2.  Location of Parking Lots. Parking lots should not occupy street frontages, and should be located behind buildings to the maximum extent feasible, so that the street frontage in both residential and non-residential areas remains pedestrian-oriented. 
3.  Relationship to Adjacent Buildings. Parking areas should be separated from buildings by either a raised concrete walkway or landscaped strip. If space allows, parking stalls directly abutting buildings should be avoided. 
4.  Pedestrian-friendly Features. Lighting, landscaping, hardscape, fencing, parking layout and pedestrian paths should all contribute to the strength and clarity of the parking lot as a deliberate and thorough design. 
B.  Access and Entries. 
1.  Pedestrian and vehicular entrances must be clearly identified and easily accessible to minimize pedestrian and vehicle conflicts. Entrances to parking lots should be from alleys, or between buildings, retaining the street frontage for buildings and locating parking to the rear of buildings, or to the side where no other alternative is available. The use of enhanced paving, landscaping, and special architectural features and details is encouraged to distinguish entrances. 
2.  Where a parking cannot be located other than adjacent to a public street, the facility should include a point of entry and clear and safe access for pedestrians from the lot, to the on-street sidewalk, to the sidewalk entrance of the building. 
  
Figure 3-3 - Enhanced Parking Lot Facility 
C.  Lighting. Carefully designed lighting is an essential element of good parking lot design. The placement, type, height number and bulb type of lights should all contribute to a coherent lighting design (see lighting under commercial guidelines). 
D.  Hardscape. 
1.  A well thought-out selection and composition of hardscape materials can help to order space and reinforce the relationship of the parking lot to its surroundings and to the buildings it serves. Entrance and exit areas, areas that are the central focus of the parking lot design, major axis and areas that act as forecourts for entrances may be suitable locations for special paving materials such as brick or stamped asphalt. 
  
Figure 3-4 - Hardscape Materials 
2.  Limit curb cuts for driveways opening to public streets. Common shared access driveways which provide access to more than one site are encouraged to reduce the number of driveway entries along commercial streets. 
  
Figure 3-5 - Spacing or Driveway Curb Cuts 
3.  Design parking areas so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars. Minimize the need for the pedestrian to cross parking aisles and landscape areas. 
4.  Access for service vehicles, trash collection and storage areas should be located on alleys where alleys exist. 
E.  Circulation. 
1.  Separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should be provided where possible. The layout of parking areas should be designed so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars, minimizing the need to walk between parked cars or to cross parking aisles and landscape areas. 
2.  Pedestrian linkages between uses in commercial developments should be emphasized. Parking lot designs should include walkways and planting that help direct pedestrians comfortably and safely to their destinations. 
  
Figure 3-6 - Pedestrian Connections 
3.  Parking aisles should be separated from primary vehicle circulation routes whenever possible. 
  
Figure 3-7 - Separate Circulation from Parking Areas 
4.  Where parking areas are connected, interior circulation should allow for a similar direction of travel and parking spaces in all areas to reduce conflict at points of connection. 
  
Figure 3-8 - Shared Parking Access 
F.  Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering. 
1.  Parking facilities should be landscaped with the following objectives in mind: 
a.  Visually break up large paved areas with landscaping; 
b.  Maximize distribution of landscaping; 
c.  Promote compatibility and function as a "good neighbor;" 
d.  Consider the use of trees planted at regular distances as a grove; and, 
e.  Reduce the amount of storm water run-off resulting from the lot; and 
f.  Shade fifty percent of the asphalt area within five years from time of installation. 
2.  If a parking lot must be located adjacent to a street, the lot should be landscaped to soften the visual impact of parked vehicles from the public right-of-way. Screening should consist of a combination of low walls and landscape materials. The objective is to strike a balance between screening parked automobiles and facilitate safety through natural surveillance opportunities. 
3.  As long as an open surveillance zone is maintained between thirty-two and six feet above grade, landscaping should be used in combination with walls and fences. 
4.  Planting areas adjacent to parking areas, drives or walks should be protected by curbing where necessary, while allowing for drainage of surface water into permeable surface areas. See Figure 3-9. 
  
Figure 3-9 - Protect Landscaping 
5.  Both perimeter and interior landscaping should incorporate canopy-type trees. The location and spacing of trees is dependent on the type of tree used, but the overall effect should be of a relatively consistent tree cover which will shade the pavement and vehicles. See Figure 3-10. 
  
Figure 3-10 - Tree Cover 
6.  Reduce conflicts between trees, lighting and signage by coordinating location of trees, light poles and signs. The maximum height of lights shall be lower than the typical pruning height of the tree used. The use of monument signs is highly encouraged to reduce tree/sign conflicts. 
7.  All trees indicated on plans shall be planted and no change of species is allowed unless approved by the director. 
8.  Planter areas shall have increased soil volume and reduced compaction to an appropriate level set by the submitted plans. The use of structural soil mix under paving to retain parking space while increasing soil volume is highly encouraged. 
9.  Tree well and planting islands shall have a minimum dimension of eight feet and be excavated to a depth of three feet and filled with amended soil as necessary. 
10.  Stakes shall be removed from trees as soon as the tree can support itself. 
11.  The pruning of parking lot trees early in order to train their growth is encouraged. 
12.  Tree care should be performed under the supervision of a certified arborist. 
13.  If a tree is removed, it must be replaced with a tree of equivalent size and value.

Editor's note Ord. No. 1922, § 1, adopted July 6, 2016, repealed the former Ch. 17.34, §§ 17.34.01017.34.130, and enacted a new Ch. 17.34 as set out herein. The former Ch. 17.34 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1869, § 2, adopted February 20, 2013. 
 
17.34.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
The city finds that signage, regardless of content or purpose, draws the visual attention of the public, and thereby creates a traffic safety hazard and degrades the aesthetic quality of the environment. The regulations established by this chapter are intended to address these issues by regulating the placement, quality, materials, size, and number of signs allowed within the city, and to require the proper maintenance of signs. The purposes of these limitations and requirements are to: 
A.  Enhance commerce within the community by providing for signs that will allow the public to easily identify uses and premises, and regulating signs on the basis of their physical design, location, and proportions; 
B.  Preserve and enhance the aesthetic, traffic safety, and environmental values of the community, and commercial, office, and industrial districts, while at the same time providing a channel of communication to the public; 
C.  Limit commercial signage to on-site locations to keep the proliferation of this signage to a more aesthetic proportion, and protect existing businesses from visual encroachment from new signage on neighboring properties; 
D.  Avoid traffic safety hazards to motorists and pedestrians caused by visual distractions and obstructions; 
E.  Promote the aesthetic quality of the community by providing for signs that enhance the attractiveness of the city as a place to live, work, and shop; and 
F.  Safeguard and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(Ord. No. 1922, § 1, 7-6-2016)

The application shall also include architectural elevations and plans of all proposed signs drawn to scale, with all dimensions noted, and include any additional information and materials as required by the department. 
B.  Design Review and Approval. The director shall review all sign permit applications and approve only those found to be in substantial conformance with the design review criteria provided in Section 17.34.050 (General Requirements for All Signs). The director may require conditions of approval as are reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. 
The director may refer sign permit applications to SPARC for action, either on the individual sign permit, or as part of a development project that is otherwise subject to SPARC review. 
C.  Master Sign Program. 
1.  When Required. A master sign program shall be approved by the director (or by SPARC upon referral by the director) prior to the issuance of any sign permit for: 
a.  A new nonresidential project with four or more tenants; and 
b.  Major rehabilitation work on an existing nonresidential project with four or more tenants that involves exterior remodeling. For the purposes of this chapter, major rehabilitation means adding more than fifty percent to the gross floor area of the building/buildings, or exterior redesign of more than fifty percent of the length of any facade within the project. 
All signs installed or replaced within the nonresidential project shall comply with the approved master sign program. 
2.  Content of Program. A master sign program shall provide standards for the uniform style, size, placement, and color palette of signs within the proposed nonresidential project. 
3.  Revisions. Revisions to a master sign program may be approved by the director if he or she first determines that the revision is minor and that the intent of the original approval, and any applicable conditions are not affected. A new sign permit shall be obtained for revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval. 
D.  Time Limit for Action. A sign permit or a master sign program shall be approved or disapproved by the review authority within fifteen working days of the application being accepted as complete in compliance with Section 17.38.060 (Initial Application Review). A sign that is submitted in full compliance with an approved master sign program shall be approved within five working days of the application being accepted as complete. 
E.  Signs and Sign Changes Allowed Without a Sign Permit. The following do not require a sign permit, provided that they comply with Section 17.34.050 (General Requirements for All Signs), and any required building permit is obtained. 
1.  Nonstructural Modifications and Maintenance. 
a.  Modifications or replacement to a face of a cabinet sign. 
b.  Nonstructural modifications of the face, design, or color of an existing sign, provided that the modifications comply with any applicable master sign program approved in compliance with subsection C of this section.

17.34.050 - General requirements for all signs. 
A.  Sign Area. The measurement of sign area to determine compliance with the sign area limitations of this chapter shall occur as follows: 
1.  The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing, writing, logo, representation, emblem, or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight lines. See Figure 3-11. 
  
Figure 3-11 - Sign Area Measurement
2.  Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area. 
3.  For freestanding signs all readable surfaces visible from a public right-of-way shall be counted in sign area calculations. 
4.  Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. 
5.  For signs that incorporate time and temperature devices, the area of these devices shall not be included in the total area of the sign. 
B.  Sign Height. Sign height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade adjacent to the base of the sign structure to the highest point of the structure, where finished grade does not include fill, planters, or other material artificially placed to allow increased sign height. 
C.  Sign Location Requirements. 
1.  All signs identifying an occupant, business, or use shall be located on the same site as the occupant, business, or use, except as otherwise allowed by this chapter. 
2.  Signage allowed on one building or frontage shall not be transferred to another building or frontage. 
3.  Each sign, including a sign located on a temporary or portable building, shall be subject to the requirements of this chapter. 
4.  No sign shall be located within the public right-of-way, except as otherwise allowed by this chapter. 
5.  A sign for the purpose of construction, sales, or leasing are permitted within a required setback area, provided it is: 
a.  Located within a permanently maintained landscaped planter area having an area at least twice that of the sign area; 
b.  Not closer than ten feet from any property line and ten feet from any access driveway; and 
c.  Not within a radius of twenty feet of the intersection of the rights-of-way of two intersecting streets. 
6.  The location of all signs shall be evaluated to ensure: 
a.  That the setback is appropriate for the height and area of a freestanding or projecting sign; 
b.  That flush or projecting signs relate to the architectural design of the building. Signs that cover windows, or that spill over natural boundaries and architectural features shall be discouraged; 
c.  That signs do not unreasonably block the sight lines of existing signs on adjacent properties; and 
d.  Pedestrian and vehicular safety. 
7.  A freestanding sign may be placed only on a site frontage adjoining a public street. 
8.  No freestanding sign shall be closer than seventy-five feet to another freestanding sign, to ensure adequate visibility for all signs. The director may waive this requirement where parcel width and/or the locations of existing signs on adjacent properties would make the seventy-five-foot separation impractical. 
D.  Design Criteria for Signs. The following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs. Substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a sign permit or building permit can be approved. 
1.  Color. Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and reflective of the dominant colors of the building or buildings being identified. Contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the building colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood (where a theme can be identified). 
2.  Materials and Structure. 
a.  Sign materials (including those for framing and support) should be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the building or buildings which the sign identifies. Insofar as possible, sign materials should match the materials used on the building and on other signs. 
b.  Materials selected for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance. 
c.  The size of the structural members (e.g. columns, crossbeams, and braces) should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports. 
d.  The use of individual letters incorporated into the building design is encouraged, rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall. 
e.  The use of reflective materials or surfaces may be approved only where the review authority determines that they will not distract motorists or create other hazards, and should be minimized in all cases. 
f.  Wall signs shall not project from the surface upon which they are attached more than required for construction purpose and in no case more than twelve inches. 
g.  Wall signs shall not project above the eave line or the edge of the roof of a building. 
E.  Copy Design Guidelines. The city does not regulate the message content (copy) of signs; however, the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs. Copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged, but not required. 
1.  Sign copy should relate only to the name and/or nature of the business or commercial center. 
2.  Permanent signs that advertise continuous sales, special prices, etc. should be avoided. 
3.  Information should be conveyed briefly or by logo, symbol, or other graphic manner. The intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business. 
4.  Freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multi-tenant center. 
F.  Illumination of Signs. The artificial illumination of signs, either from an internal or external source, shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rights-of-way and properties. 
1.  External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of any object other than the sign. 
2.  The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties. In areas with low ambient nighttime illumination levels (e.g., residential neighborhoods or business districts with little or no illuminated signing) applicants shall be encouraged to use light, illuminated copy against dark or opaque backgrounds. 
3.  Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other illuminating devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness or color, except as otherwise allowed in Section 17.34.070 (Programmable Electronic Signs). 
4.  Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or construed as traffic control devices. 
5.  Neither the direct nor reflected light from primary light sources shall create a hazard to operators of motor vehicles. 
6.  Incandescent lamps shall not be visible from a public right-of-way or adjacent property. 
7.  Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible. 
G.  Maintenance of Signs. Signs and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, shall be maintained in good repair and functioning properly at all times. Repairs to signs shall be of equal or better in quality of materials and design as the original sign. Signs which are not properly maintained and are dilapidated shall be deemed to be a public nuisance, and may be abated in compliance with Lodi Municipal Code. 
When existing signs are removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other supports that are no longer required shall be removed. Unpainted areas shall be painted to match the adjacent portion of the building or sign support structure. 
H.  Signs on Public Property. No signs are allowed on public property, except for the following: 
1.  A public sign erected by or on behalf of the city or other public entity to post legal notices, identify public property, convey public information, or direct or regulate pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
2.  An informational sign of a public utility or transit company regarding its poles, lines, pipes, facilities, or routes. 
3.  An emergency warning sign erected by the city or other public entity, a public utility company, or contractor doing authorized or permitted work on public property. 
4.  Signs constructed by the city to direct persons to specific districts, regions, or public facilities. 
5.  Banner signs on city property (e.g., light poles in downtown area or along major corridors). 
6.  Advertising signs on transit, police, parks and other city property (e.g. city facilities, including but not limited to transit shelters, buses, park facilities, and Hutchins Street Square).

Signs must be more than just a way to relay information; they must be an architectural extension of a building. The objective of the standards and guidelines is not to create uniformity, but to eliminate those elements that result in a cluttered and unattractive physical environment. Few outward features of a business display the owner's confidence and quality as well as signage. These basic parameters provide for creative signs that may still be as varied and different as the businesses they represent. 
a.  Permitted Sign Types.

i.  Temporary signs as set forth in Section 17.34.070(D). 
ii.  Permanent Signs. In addition to those permitted above shall be limited to: 
(A)  Existing built-in signs that are integral to the building design. 
(B)  Painted window signs that cover a maximum of twenty-five percent of the window area. 
(C)  Any sign identifying hours of operation that have an area of less than three square feet. 
d.  Sign Maintenance. High levels of maintenance are essential if investment in the downtown is to be encouraged. Because signs are meant to be seen, maintenance is especially important. 
i.  Paint. Signs shall be retained in good condition, with touch-up or repainted as needed. Peeling paint should be replaced promptly. 
ii.  Repair. Damaged signs and poles shall be repaired promptly or removed. 
iii.  Illumination. Bulbs and fixtures shall be replaced promptly if they burn out or are broken. 
iv.  Awnings. Awnings that are damaged and/or faded shall be repaired or replaced promptly. 
e.  Architectural Compatibility. A building's architectural style and overall proportions should guide the design of signs. Signs should be located on the facade in areas designed for this function; e.g. a recessed or framed area between the first and second floor, or a parapet panel between shopfront and roofline. 
f.  Sign Types. 
i.  Flush-mounted and painted wall signs should align with major architectural elements, such as doors and windows. Ornamental elements, such as moldings, pilasters, arches, clerestory windows, roof eaves, or cornice lines should be used as a frame. 
(A)  Relationship to Cornice or Roof Line. Signs should not extend above the cornice line or into or above roof areas, unless they function as an integral part of the roof design. For example: 
(1)  A sign board may extend above the cornice line of an otherwise flat-topped building if it is designed as a parapet in keeping with the style of the rest of the building. 
(2)  A sign board may extend above an existing parapet, if it is located to function as an accent to the basic parapet design. 
ii.  Projecting Signs. 
(A)  Proportion. Projecting signs with vertically-oriented messages should be slender in appearance, with a proportion of at least two to one, height to width. Projecting signs with horizontally-oriented messages may be rectangular or square; if located below an awning or canopy as a hanging "blade" sign, they should also be slender, proportioned two to one width to height. 
(B)  Structural Support. Should be an attractive addition to the overall design of the sign and/or building. Ornamental metal is recommended. Wooden supports are also appropriate if designed to complement the sign; however, undetailed, standard-size lumber should not be used. 
(C)  Relationship to Cornice or Roof Line. Projecting signs should not extend above the cornice line or into the roof area, unless they are an integral part of a completely new facade design or a faithful accent to existing architectural details or forms. Projection signs should not extend above the eave line of a sloped roof. 
iii.  Awning and Canopy Signs. 
(A)  Color. Combinations for awning or canopy signs should be simple. Lettering color and background color should contrast for legibility. Subtle bands of color are appropriate for awnings; more complex patterns or textures should generally not be used. 
(B)  Location of MessageAwnings. Lettering should not appear on the sloped or curved portion. Information may be located on the valance (the front vertical portion). 
(C)  Location of MessageCanopies. Signs on canopies should be in the form of letters or a signboard integrated with the canopy fascia, or freestanding letters mounted on top and extending above the fascia. 
iv.  Other Sign Types. 
(A)  Figurative signs shaped to reflect the silhouette of a particular object (for example, a key, a coffee cup, etc.) are encouraged. These may be wall-mounted or projecting, but should reflect guidelines for the specific type of sign as listed above. 
v.  Not Allowed. 
(A)  "Canned" signs are internally illuminated plastic panels within a sheet metal box enclosure. They should not be used. Inexpensive canned signs use a limited range of colors and lettering types, and tend to have no relationship to the architecture of the building. 
(B)  Illuminated vinyl awning signs are more appropriate for "commercial strip areas" and shall not be used. 
g.  Materials. Recommendations are: 
i.  Signboards of wood or metal, with painted or engraved letters, or mounted letters of wood or metal. 
ii.  Silhouette or Figurative Signs. Three-dimensional letters, symbols, and/or ornamental figures made of wood or metal. 
iii.  Custom Neon. Exterior-mounted on a signboard or metal support frame or enclosure, or interior-mounted behind clerestory or display windows. 
iv.  Fabric awnings such as canvas with painted or applied lettering; plastic or vinyl awnings should not be used. 
h.  Lighting. Recommendations are: 
i.  Backlit with lighting inside and behind projecting lettering. 
ii.  Top or bottom lit with single or multiple spotlights. 
2.  Mixed Use Corridor District. Each sign within the MCO zoning district shall comply with the following standards: 
a.  General Specifications and Requirements. Signs within the MCO zoning district shall comply with the general specifications and requirements identified in development code Section 17.34.060 (B)(1)(a). 
b.  Free-standing Signs. The design of the multi-tenant pylon signs, multi-tenant monument signs and center identification monument sign shall be commensurate with the architecture of the development. 
i.  Center Identification Sign. One center identification sign, no higher than eight feet, shall be permitted. The sign shall be a single-sided, identifying the entrance to the center. No tenant names shall be displayed on the identification sign. 
ii.  Monument Signs. 
(A)  One multi-tenant monument sign, no higher than twelve feet, shall be permitted. A shopping center of ten acres or more may have two monument signs. These signs may have two-sided panels to identify multiple tenants within the shopping center; and 
(B)  The monument signs shall have a maximum of eighty-four square feet of tenant identification and eight square foot of shopping center identity. 
c.  Tenant Signage. The sign program regulates the total allowed signage each tenant may have, based upon the frontages of each store. Tenant signage shall not exceed the total allowed maximum signage per tenant. 
i.  Tenants shall be allowed two square feet of signage per lineal foot of frontage for the front elevation and two square feet of signage multiplied by seventy-five percent per lineal foot of frontage for side (end caps) and rear elevations. 
ii.  The signs may either be internally illuminated plex-faced channel letters or halo illuminated fabricated aluminum reverse pan channel letters. 
iii.  Single pad tenants shall be allowed one wall sign per each business frontage facing a street, pedestrian plaza and/or parking lot. The total allowed sign area shall be two square feet of signage per lineal foot of frontage for the front elevation and two square feet of signage multiplied by seventy-five percent per lineal foot of frontage for side and rear elevations.

17.34.080 - Exceptions to sign area standards. 
The director or other applicable review authority may grant an administrative deviation to the allowed area of a sign in compliance with Section 17.40.050 (Variations and Administrative Deviations) if it is first determined that: 
A.  The position or setback of the building on the site requires additional area for effective signing. The exception may increase the allowed sign area by up to twenty-five percent; or 
B.  The exceptional size of the structures, uses, or site requires additional sign area for effective identification from major approaches to the site. The exception may increase the allowed sign area by up to twenty-five percent; or 
C.  The name of the business or use to be identified is exceptionally long, so that sign readability would be impaired by crowding words into the allowable sign area. The exception may increase the allowed sign area by up to twenty-five percent; or 
D.  Signing proposed is indistinguishable from the architecture itself (supergraphic design) or achieves the level of sculptural art. 
(Ord. No. 1922, § 1, 7-6-2016)

(Ord. No. 1922, § 1, 7-6-2016)  
17.34.130 - Sign design guidelines. 
The following guidelines should be considered in the design of all signs within Lodi. These guidelines are intended to complement other requirements in the previous sections of this chapter: 
A.  Design Compatibility. 
1.  Creative Design Encouraged. Signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are located. A well-designed sign can be a major asset to a building. 
2.  Proportionate Size and Scale. The scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be in proportion with the scale of the structure. 
3.  Integrate Signs with the Building. Signs should not obscure architectural features. Their design should be integrated with the design of the building. A well-designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design and over-all color scheme. Signs in multiple tenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building. 
  
Figure 3-13Design Compatibility
4.  Reduce Sign Impact. Because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity, signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
  
Figure 3-14Reduce Sign Impact
5.  Sign Placement. Place wall signs to establish facade rhythm, scale and proportion where facade rhythm does not otherwise exist. On buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. 
  
Figure 3-15Sign Placement
6.  Pedestrian-oriented Signs are Encouraged. It is desirable and encouraged to include a pedestrian-oriented sign as one of the permitted signs for a business. Pedestrian-oriented signs are signs that are designed for and directed toward pedestrians so that they can easily and comfortably read the sign as they stand adjacent to the business. 
  
Figure 3-16Pedestrian-Oriented Sign
7.  Use Individual Letters. As an alternative to an attached sign, lettering may be painted directly on the building facade. However, signs should not be painted directly over ornamental and architectural features or over brick and stone surfaces of buildings. 
B.  Color. 
1.  Select Colors Carefully. Color is one of the most important aspects of visual communication. It can be used to catch the eye or to communicate ideas or feelings. Colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Too many colors used thoughtlessly can confuse and negate the message of a sign. 
2.  Use Contrasting Colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. 
  
Figure 3-17Contrasting Letters and Background
3.  Avoid Using Too Many Colors. Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided. Small accents of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive, but the competition of large areas of many different colors often decreases readability. 
4.  Use Complementary Colors. Sign colors should complement the colors used on the structures and the project as a whole. 
C.  Materials. 
1.  Sign Materials. The following sign materials are recommended: 
a.  Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, and properly sealed, primed and painted, or stained). 
b.  Metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved, and properly primed and painted or factory-coated to protect against corrosion). 
c.  High density pre-formed foam or similar material. New materials may be very appropriate if properly designed in a manner consistent with these guidelines, and painted or otherwise finished to compliment the architecture. 
d.  Custom neon tubing, in the form of graphics or lettering, may be incorporated into several allowed sign types. 
2.  Compatibility of Materials. Sign materials should be compatible with the design of the face of the facade where they are placed. The selected materials should contribute to the legibility of the sign. For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections. 
3.  Appropriate Materials. Paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use (except on awnings) because they deteriorate quickly. Paper and cloth signs are appropriate for interior temporary use only. The use of interior signs on paper or cloth should be the result of careful thinking about readability and the image of the business. 
D.  Sign Legibility. An effective sign should do more than attract attention, it should communicate a message. Usually, this is a question of the readability of words and phrases. The most significant influence on legibility is lettering. 
1.  Pedestrian-oriented Signs. Make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians. The pedestrian-oriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet; the vehicle-oriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance. The closer a sign's viewing distance, the smaller that sign need be. See Table 3-3. 
TABLE 3-3 

Lettering Size for Pedestrian-oriented Signs 
Minimum Character 
Size (inches) 	Intended Reading 
Distance (feet) 
3.5 	60 
4.0 	70 
4.5 	80 
5.0 	90 
5.5 to 6.0 	100 
 
2.  Use a Brief Message. A brief message should be used whenever possible. The fewer the words, the more effective the sign. A sign with a brief, succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive. Evaluate each word. If the word does not contribute directly to the basic message of the sign, it detracts from it and probably should be deleted. 
3.  Space Letters and Words Carefully. Letters and words should not be spaced too closely. Crowding of letters, words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read. Conversely, over-spacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually, again obscuring the message. As a general rule, letters should not occupy more than seventy-five percent of sign panel area. 
4.  Use Symbols and Logos. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words wherever appropriate. Pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewer's mind than a written message. 
  
Figure 3-18Use of Symbols/Logos
  
Figure 3-19Letter Spacing
5.  Limit the Number of Letter Styles. The number of lettering styles should be limited in order to increase legibility. A general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
E.  Sign Illumination. The possible illumination of a sign should be carefully considered. Like color, illumination can provide more effective visual communication, or can confuse the message. Imaginative and innovative lighting techniques for signs are encouraged. 
1.  Use Illumination Only if Necessary. Consider if the sign needs to be lighted at all. Lights in the window display may be sufficient to identify the business. This is particularly true if good window graphics are used. Often, nearby street lights provide ample illumination of a sign after dark. 
  
Figure 3-20Use of Existing Illumination
2.  Use a Direct Light Source. If the sign can be illuminated by a direct source of light (e.g., spotlight), this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures supported in front of the structure cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the face of the structure as well. Direct lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface, and signs become an integral part of the facade. Direct lighting is also appropriate because it produces a more intimate ambiance on the street. The lighting of signs should be considered as an element in a building's overall lighting design. 
3.  Shield the Light Source. Whenever direct lighting fixtures are used (fluorescent or incandescent), care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-of-way. Signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability. 
  
Figure 3-21Shielded Light Source
4.  Back-lighted Signs. Back-lighted, solid letters are encouraged. Signs consisting of opaque individually cut letters mounted directly on a structure (push-through letters) can often use a distinctive element of the structure's facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure.

E.  Density Bonus Calculation and Allowance. 
1.  State Law Preemption. Pursuant to state law, the granting of a density bonus or the granting of a density bonus together with an incentive(s) shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, specific plan amendment, rezone, or other discretionary approvals. 
2.  Density Bonus Calculation. An applicant must choose a density bonus from only one applicable affordability category in below subsection 3 and may not combine categories with the exception of child care facilities, which may be combined with an affordable housing development, for an additional density bonus up to a combined maximum of thirty-five percent. 
3.  Density Bonus Allowance. In calculating the number of units required for very low, low and moderate income households, the density bonus units shall not be included. In no event shall a density bonus exceed thirty-five percent. A housing development that satisfies all applicable provisions of this chapter shall be allowed the density bonuses as described in Table 3-4: 
TABLE 3-4 
Density Bonus Category 	Minimum Affordability 
Required 	Density Bonus Permitted 	Increase in Density Bonus Permitted 
Very Low Income 	At least 5% of the total units of a housing development are restricted for very low income households 	20 to 35% 	An additional 2.5% density bonus increase for each additional 1% increase in very low income units above the initial 5% threshold 
Low Income 	At least 10% of the total units of a housing development are restricted for low income households 	20 to 35% 	An additional 1.5% density bonus increase for each additional 1% increase in low income units above the initial 10% threshold 
Moderate Income 	At least 10% of the total dwelling units in a common interest development are restricted for persons/families of moderate income 	5 to 35% 	An additional 1% density bonus increase for each additional 1% increase in moderate income units above the initial 10% threshold 
Senior 	No affordability requirement 	20% 	No affordability requirement 
Child Care 	Incorporation of a child care facility as part of a project that is eligible for a density bonus 	As determined by the director 	N/A

G.  Child Care Facilities. 
1.  Child Care Facility Density Bonus. When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that is eligible for a density bonus under this chapter and California Government Code Section 65917.5, and includes a child care facility that will be located on the premises or adjacent to the housing development, the city shall grant either: 
a.  An additional density bonus that is an amount determined by the director; or 
b.  An additional incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
2.  Child Care Facility Requirements. The city shall require, as a condition of approving the housing development, that the following occur: 
a.  The Child care facility shall remain in operation for a period of time that is as long as or longer than the period of time during which the affordable units are required to remain affordable per this chapter; and 
b.  Of the children who attend the child care facility, the children of very low income households, low income households or families of moderate income households shall equal a percentage that is equal to or greater than the percentage of affordable units in the housing development that are required for very low, low or families of moderate income households. 
3.  Child Care Facility Criteria. The city shall not be required to provide a density bonus or incentive for a child care facility if it finds, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities. 
H.  General Guidelines. 
1.  Location of Bonus Units. As required by California Government Code Section 65915(g), the location of density bonus units within the qualifying housing development may be at the discretion of the developer, and need not be in the same area of the project where the units for the low income households are located as long as the density bonus units are located within the same housing development. 
2.  Infrastructure and Supply Capacity. Criteria to be considered in analyzing the requested bonus will include the availability and capacity of infrastructure (water, sewer, storm drain, road capacity, etc.) and water supply to accommodate the additional density. 
I.  Findings for Approval for Density Bonus and/or Incentive(s). 
1.  Density Bonus Approval. The following finding shall be made by the approving authority in order to approve a density bonus request: 
a.  The density bonus request meets the requirements of this chapter. 
2.  Density Bonus Approval with Incentive(s). The following findings shall be made by the approving authority in order to approve a density bonus and incentive(s) request: 
a.  The density bonus request meets the requirements of this chapter; 
b.  The incentive is required in order to provide affordable housing; and 
c.  Approval of the incentive(s) will have no specific adverse impacts upon health, safety, or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to very low, low, and moderate income households. 
3.  Denial of a Request for an Incentive(s). The approving authority shall make the following findings prior to disallowing an incentive (in the case where an accompanying density bonus may be approved, or in the case of where an incentive(s) is requested for senior housing or child care facility): 
a.  That the incentive is not necessary in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in this chapter. 
b.  That the incentive would result in specific adverse impacts upon health, safety, or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to very low, low, and moderate income households. 
J.  Affordable Housing Agreement Required. 
1.  Agreement Required. In approving a density bonus, the associated permit or tentative map shall require that an affordable housing agreement, or other form of agreement as approved by the city attorney, effectuating the terms of affordability of the development be executed prior to effectuation of the permit or recordation of the final map or issuance of a building permit. 
2.  Continued Availability. The density bonus request shall include the procedures proposed by the developer to maintain the continued affordability of all affordable income density bonus units and shall be evidenced by an affordable housing agreement as follows: 
a.  An applicant shall agree to, and the city shall ensure, continued affordability of all very low and low income units that qualified the applicant for the award of the density bonus for thirty years or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program. Rents for the lower income density bonus units shall be set at an affordable rent as defined in Section 17.36.050(B) of this chapter. Owner-occupied units shall be available at an affordable housing cost as defined in Section 17.36.050(B) of this chapter. 
b.  An applicant shall agree to, and the city shall ensure that, the initial occupants of the moderate income units are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus in the common interest development as defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, are persons and families of moderate income, as defined in Section 17.36.050(B) of this chapter and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost, as that cost is defined in Section 17.36.050(B) of this chapter. The city shall enforce an equity-sharing agreement unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. The following apply to the equity-sharing agreement: 
i.  Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall then be used within three years for any of the purposes described in subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote homeownership. 
ii.  For purposes of this subdivision, the city's initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate-income household plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. 
iii.  For purposes of this subdivision, the city's proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale.

D.  Council Waiver. The council may waive the prohibition in subsection A, above if the council finds that by reason of changed legal, physical, or sociological circumstances, reconsideration would be in the best interests of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.42.080 - Covenants of easements. 
A.  Applicability. When necessary to achieve the land use goals of the city, the city may require a property owner holding property in common ownership to execute and record a covenant of easement in favor of the city, in compliance with Government Code Sections 65870 et seq. 
1.  A covenant of easement may be required to provide for emergency access, landscaping, light and air access, ingress and egress, parking, solar access, or for open space. 
2.  The covenant of easement may be imposed as a condition of approval by the review authority. 
B.  Form of Covenant. The form of the covenant shall be approved by the city attorney, and the covenant of easement shall: 
1.  Describe the real property to be subject to the easement; 
2.  Describe the real property to be benefited by the easement; 
3.  Identify the city approval or permit granted which relied on or required the covenant; and 
4.  Identify the purpose(s) of the easement. 
C.  Recordation. The covenant of easement shall be recorded in the county recorder's office. 
D.  Effect of Covenant. From and after the time of its recordation, the covenant of easement shall: 
1.  Act as an easement in compliance with state law (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 801) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Civil Code), except that it shall not merge into any other interest in the real property. Civil Code Section 1104 shall be applicable to the conveyance of the affected real property; and 
2.  Impart notice to all persons to the extent afforded by the recording laws of the state. Upon recordation, the burdens of the covenant shall be binding on, and the covenant shall benefit, all successors-in-interest to the real property. 
E.  Enforceability of Covenant. The covenant of easement shall be enforceable by the successors-in-interest to the real property benefited by the covenant and the city. Nothing in this section creates standing in any person, other than the city, and any owner of the real property burdened or benefited by the covenant, to enforce or to challenge the covenant or any requested amendment or release. 
F.  Release of Covenant. The release of the covenant of easement may be effected by the commission, or the council on appeal, following a noticed public hearing in compliance with Chapter 17.74 (Public Hearings). 
1.  The covenant of easement may be released by the city, at the request of any person, including the city or an affected property owner, on a finding that the covenant, on the subject property, is no longer necessary to achieve the land use goals of the city. 
2.  A notice of the release of the covenant of easement shall be recorded by the director with the county recorder's office. 
G.  Fees. The city shall impose fees to recover the city's reasonable cost of processing a request for a release. Fees for the processing shall be established by the council's fee resolution.

Chapter 17.48 - SUBDIVISION MAP APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS 
 
17.48.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter determines when city approval of a tentative map, parcel or final map is required. In general, the procedure for subdivision first requires the approval of a tentative map, and then the approval of a parcel map (for four or fewer parcels) or a final map (for five or more parcels) to complete the subdivision process. The tentative map review process is used to evaluate the compliance of the proposed subdivision with the adopted city standards, and the appropriateness of the proposed subdivision design. Parcel and final maps are precise engineering documents that detail the location and dimensions of all parcel boundaries in an approved subdivision and, after approval, are recorded in the office of the county recorder. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.48.020 - Type of subdivision approval required. 
Any subdivision of an existing parcel into two or more parcels shall require approval by the city in compliance with the provisions of this article. 
A.  Tentative Map Requirements. Any subdivision or resubdivision of land within the city shall require the filing and approval of a tentative map in compliance with Map Act Section 66426, except as otherwise provided by the Map Act. 
B.  Parcel and Final Map Requirements. A parcel or final map shall be required as follows: 
1.  Parcel Map. A parcel map shall be prepared and filed in compliance with Chapter 17.54 for a subdivision creating four or fewer parcels when required by the Map Act, except where Map Act Section 66426 exempts a subdivision from this requirement. 
2.  Final Map. The filing and approval of a final map (Chapter 17.54) shall be required for a subdivision of five or more parcels. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.48.030 - Applications deemed approved. 
Any subdivision application deemed approved in compliance with Government Code Section 65956 or Map Act Article 2, Chapter 3 (Government Code Sections 66452 et seq.), shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this article which shall be satisfied by the subdivider before any building permits or land use permits are issued. Parcel or final maps filed for record after their tentative map is deemed approved shall remain subject to all the mandatory requirements of this article and the Map Act, including Map Act Sections 66473, 66473.5 and 66474. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.48.040 - Exceptions to subdivision standards. 
An exception to any of the provisions of this article may be requested by a subdivider in compliance with this section. An exception shall not be used to waive or modify provisions of the Map Act, or any provision of this article that is duplicated or paraphrased from the Map Act. 
A.  Application. An application for an exception shall be submitted on forms provided by the department together with the required filing fee. The application shall include a description of each standard and requirement for which an exception is requested, together with the reasons why the subdivider believes the exception is justified. 
B.  Filing and Processing. A request for an exception may be filed with the tentative map application to which it applies, or after approval of the tentative map. An exception shall be processed and acted upon in the same manner as the tentative map, concurrently with the tentative map if the exception request was filed at the same time. The approval of an exception shall not constitute approval of the tentative map and shall not extend the time limits for the expiration of the map established by Section 17.52.130 (Tentative Map Time Limits, Expirations, and Time Extensions). 
C.  Approval of Exception. The planning commission shall have the authority to approve or deny exception requests in compliance with this section. The commission shall not grant an exception unless all the following findings are first made: 
1.  There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to the proposed subdivision, including size, shape, topography, location, or surroundings; 
2.  The exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions are not due to any action of the subdivider subsequent to the enactment of this article; 
3.  The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the vicinity and zoning district and denied to the proposed subdivision; 
4.  Granting the exception will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located; and 
5.  The exception will not affect the consistency of the proposed subdivision with the general plan or any applicable specific plan. 
D.  Conditions of Approval. In granting an exception, the commission shall secure substantially the same objectives of the regulations for which the exception is requested and shall impose whatever conditions it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and convenience, and to mitigate any environmental impacts in compliance with CEQA.

C.  Subdivision Improvement StandardsConditions of Approval. The applicable subdivision improvement and dedication requirements of this article and any other improvements and dedications required by the review authority in compliance with Section 17.52.070 (Tentative Map Approval or Disapproval), shall be described in conditions of approval adopted for each approved tentative map (Section 17.52.080). The design, construction or installation of all subdivision improvements shall comply with the requirements of the public works director. 
D.  Conflicting Provisions. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this article and other provisions of this development code, or other provisions of the municipal code, the most restrictive provisions shall control. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this article and the Map Act, the Map Act shall control. 
E.  Extent of Improvements RequiredFour or Fewer Parcels. Improvements required for subdivision of four or fewer parcels shall be limited to those allowed by Map Act Section 66411.1. 
F.  Oversizing of Improvements. The oversizing of the improvements required to be installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision may be required in compliance with the Map Act.

(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.50.030 - Access, circulation, streets. 
Proposed subdivisions shall be designed to provide adequate access from each new parcel to a city street, in compliance with this section. 
A.  General Access and Circulation Requirements. The subdivider shall provide a comprehensive circulation system, designed and constructed in compliance with this section, the city's public improvement design standards and construction specifications, and with the circulation element of the general plan. 
1.  Public streets shall be required when: 
a.  The street is shown as an arterial or collector in the circulation element of the general plan, or any specific plan; 
b.  The street will be used by the general public as a through access route; or 
c.  A public street is necessary for special needs including but not limited to bus routes, public service access, bicycle routes and pedestrian access. 
2.  Private streets are allowed only in compliance with subsection F, following. 
B.  Alternative Standards. The review authority may consider and approve proposed access and street design solutions that differ from the provisions of this section, and the city's improvement standards where deemed necessary to properly address the characteristics of adjacent land uses and/or anticipated traffic volumes, or to maintain neighborhood character. The use of alternative standards shall be authorized through the exception procedure in Section 17.48.040. 
C.  Access to Subdivision. Every subdivision shall be designed to have access to a city street. Access shall be provided by: 
1.  The subdivision abutting a city street, where the length of the subdivision along the street, the street right-of-way, and the width of the right-of-way will accommodate the construction of all road improvements required by this section; or 
2.  The subdivision being connected to a city street by a non-exclusive right-of-way easement for street, utility, and appurtenant drainage facilities purposes, where the easement shall be: 
a.  Offered for dedication; 
b.  Unencumbered by any senior rights that might serve to restrict its proposed use; and 
c.  Of a width and location to accommodate the construction of all improvements required by this section and the city's public improvement design standards and construction specifications.

1.  City Street Access Required. Each parcel within a proposed subdivision shall be provided access by being located on an existing city street or a new city street designed and improved in compliance with subsection C, or to a private street if allowed by subsection F. 
2.  Frontage Roads. When lots are proposed to front on a major arterial or state highway, the review authority may require the subdivider to dedicate and improve a service or frontage road separate from the arterial or highway. 
3.  Waiver of Direct Street Access. Whenever the review authority finds a safety hazard would be created as the result of direct access, the review authority may impose a requirement that any dedication or offer of dedication of a street shall include a waiver of direct access rights to the street from any property shown on a final map as abutting the street, and that if the dedication is accepted, the waiver shall become effective in compliance with the provisions of the waiver of direct access. The review authority may also require waivers of access to an existing, already dedicated street that abuts the subdivision. 
E.  Design and Improvement of Proposed Streets. New streets proposed or required within a new subdivision or adjacent to a new subdivision shall be located and designed in compliance with adopted city policies, and in compliance with the city's public improvement design standards and construction specifications. 
1.  Access to Unsubdivided Property. When a proposed subdivision abuts vacant land that is designated by the general plan for future subdivision and development, the review authority may require that streets to be constructed with the proposed subdivision be extended to the boundary of the property to provide access to the future development. 
2.  Improvements to Existing Streets. 
a.  The subdivider shall dedicate and improve all streets, including curbs, gutters, sidewalks and street pavement in accordance with adopted city policies. 
b.  If street improvements exist that do not meet existing city standards or are inadequate or a hazard to the general public, then these improvements shall be reconstructed to current city standards. 
3.  Reimbursement for Excess Street Width. The subdivider or developer may be reimbursed for excess width street construction and right-of-way or for construction or permanent improvements which front adjacent property. Reimbursement shall be made by private reimbursement agreement in accordance with Chapter 17.62. For purposes of this section excess width streets are defined as: 
a.  New streets over sixty-eight feet in width;

F.  Private Streets. Private roads are allowed as provided in this section. Private streets shall not be permitted except where the commission determines that a private street system will adequately serve the proposed subdivision, will not be a substantial detriment to adjoining properties and will not disrupt or prevent the establishment of an orderly circulation system in the vicinity of the subdivision. 
1.  Maintenance Requirements. Provisions satisfactory to the public works director and city attorney shall be made for lot owners association or other organization to assume responsibility for the maintenance of private streets and ownership of the street right-of-ways of any subdivision. 
2.  Security and Conditions. The commission and/or council may require any guarantees and conditions it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this article pertaining to private streets. Private streets and easements providing access to parcels within a subdivision shall be located and shown on the parcel or final map. 
G.  Alternative Circulation Systems. Proposed subdivisions shall be designed to provide rights-of-way for pedestrian paths, bikeways and multiple use trails consistent with the circulation element of the general plan, and/or other applicable general plan provisions.

2.  Conditions of Approval. In approving a lot line adjustment, the department shall adopt conditions or exactions only as necessary to conform the adjustment and proposed parcels to the requirements of the general plan, this development code and Chapter 15 (Buildings and Construction) of the municipal code, to reduce the prepayment of rear property taxes prior to the approval of the lot line adjustment, or to facilitate the relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure, or easements. 
E.  Completion of Lot Line Adjustment. 
1.  Upon receiving approval of a lot line adjustment, the applicant shall submit for review new legal descriptions prepared, stamped and signed by a registered civil engineer, qualified to practice land surveying per Section 8731 of the Land Surveyors Act, or a licensed land surveyor, along with those items and information which may have been required by the public works department or other city departments and agencies.

17.56.030 - Parcel mergers. 
A.  Merger Not Required. Two or more contiguous parcels or units of land that have been subdivided under the provisions of this article or the Map Act shall not merge by virtue of the fact that the contiguous parcels are held by the same ownership. No further proceedings under this article shall be required for the purpose of sale, lease or financing, except as provided by this article. 
B.  Processing of Requested Merger. Upon request of the legal owner of contiguous parcels, the City may approve the merger of the property in compliance with Map Act Section 66499.20 3/4. 
1.  Application Requirements. A request for merger shall include all information and materials required by the department, and the filing fee required by the city's fee resolution.

B.  Applicability. A certificate of compliance is a recorded document acknowledging that the city considers the subject parcel to be a legal lot of record. A conditional certificate of compliance is used instead of a certificate of compliance to validate a parcel that was not legally subdivided. Any person owning real property, or a purchaser of the property in a contract of sale of the property, may request a certificate of compliance. 
C.  Application Contents. A certificate of compliance application shall include the form provided by the department, the required filing fee, and a chain of title, consisting of copies of all deeds beginning before the division and thereafter, unless the parcels were created through a recorded subdivision map. 
D.  Review and Approval. 
1.  Public Works Director review. The public works director shall review all available information and make a determination whether the real property was divided in accordance with the Map Act, this article, and other applicable provisions of the municipal code. Upon making the determination, the public works director shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed with the county recorder. In the event that the public works director determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of this article or the Map Act, the application shall instead be processed as a conditional certificate of compliance (subsection E). 
2.  Form of Certificate. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property, shall state that the division complies with the provisions of the Map Act and this article, and shall include all information required by Map Act Section 66499.35. 
3.  Effective Date of Certificate. A certificate of compliance shall not become final until the document has been recorded by the county recorder. 
E.  Conditional Certificates of Compliance. A conditional certificate of compliance is used to validate a parcel that was not legally divided. If the current owners are the original subdividers, conditions may be based on current standards. The preparation, filing and processing of a conditional certificate of compliance application shall occur in compliance with this section. 
1.  Application. An application for a conditional certificate of compliance shall be prepared and include the same materials as a certificate of compliance. 
2.  Review and Approval. Upon making a determination that the real property does not comply with the provisions of this article or the Map Act, the public works director shall grant a conditional certificate of compliance, imposing conditions as provided by subsection (E)(3) (Conditions of Approval). 
3.  Conditions of Approval. If the owners of the property for which a certificate is requested are the original subdividers, the public works director may impose any conditions that would be applicable to a current subdivision, as provided by the Map Act and this article, regardless of when the property was divided. If the owners had no responsibility for the subdivision that created the parcel, the public works director may only impose conditions that would have been applicable at the time the property was acquired by the current owners. 
4.  Appeal. A decision to issue a conditional certificate of compliance and/or the conditions imposed by the public works director may be appealed to the commission in compliance with Chapter 17.70 (Appeals) of this title. 
5.  Completion of Process. Following expiration of the ten-day appeal period after the determination and imposition of conditions by the public works director, the public works director shall file a conditional certificate of compliance with the county recorder. The certificate shall identify the property, and serve as notice to the property owner or purchaser who applied for the certificate, a grantee of the owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of the conditions shall be required before subsequent issuance of a permit or other approval for the development of the property. 
6.  Effective Date of Certificate. A conditional certificate of compliance shall not become effective until the document has been recorded by the county recorder.

Chapter 17.58 - DEDICATIONS AND EXACTIONS 
 
17.58.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
This chapter establishes standards for subdivider dedications of land or payment of fees, in conjunction with subdivision approval. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.58.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Compliance Required. All proposed subdivisions shall comply with the requirements of this article for dedications, reservations, or the payment of fees. 
B.  Conditions of Approval. The requirements of this article as they apply to a specific subdivision shall be described in conditions of approval adopted by the review authority for the tentative map. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.58.030 - Findings required for dedications and exactions. 
The review authority may require any of the dedications or exactions described in this article through conditions of approval of a proposed tentative map only after first making findings which: 
A.  Identify the purpose for the dedication or exaction; and 
B.  Demonstrate that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the dedication or exaction and the characteristics and impacts of the subdivision from which the dedication or exaction is required. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.58.040 - School site dedications. 
A.  Dedication Requirement. In compliance with Map Act Section 66478, a subdivider may be required to dedicate land as the review authority determines to be necessary for adequate elementary school facilities for the residents of the subdivision. Dedication may be required only if the subdivider and/or successors in interest to the property: 
1.  Have owned the land being subdivided for less than ten years before filing the tentative map; and 
2.  Develop, or complete the development, of a subdivision of more than four hundred dwelling units within a single school district, within a period of three years or less. 
B.  Tentative Map Approval. If the Lodi Unified School District, as applicable, responds to the referral of the tentative map application (Section 17.52.030) with a report to the city describing the land the district deems necessary and suitable to provide adequate elementary school service to residents of the proposed subdivision, the review authority shall require the dedication of land as a condition of approval of the tentative map. As required by Map Act Section 66478, the dedication requirement shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible, or substantially exceed the amount of land ordinarily allowed under the procedures of the State Allocation Board. 
C.  Timing of Dedication. The required dedication may occur before, concurrently with, or up to sixty days after the filing of a final map on any portion of the subdivision. If the school district accepts the dedication, the district shall pay the subdivider the amounts required by Map Act Section 66478, and shall record the certificate required by Map Act Section 66478. 
D.  Termination of Dedication Requirement. The requirement of dedication shall automatically terminate unless, within thirty days after the requirement is imposed by the review authority, the school district makes a binding commitment to the subdivider agreeing to accept the dedication at any time before the construction of the first four hundred dwelling units. Upon acceptance of the dedication, the school district shall repay to the subdivider and/or successors the costs specified in Business and Professions Code Section 11525.2. 
E.  Judicial Review. Any person who is aggrieved by or fails to agree to the reasonableness of any requirement imposed in compliance with this section may bring a special proceeding in the Superior Court in compliance with Map Act Section 66499.37. 
F.  Reversion of LandRepurchase. Should the school district find itself unable to accept the dedication for reasons other than specified in the commitment with the subdivider, the dedicated land shall revert to the subdivider. If the dedication is accepted and the school district within ten years from the date of acceptance offers the property or any substantial part thereof for public sale, the subdivider shall have the first option to repurchase the property for the price paid by the district, plus a sum equal to the amount of property taxes which would have been paid during the period of public ownership. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.58.050 - Reservations of land for public facilities. 
As a condition of approval of a tentative map, the city may require the subdivider to reserve sites appropriate in area and location for fire stations, libraries or other public uses, pay an in-lieu fee or both at the option of the city in compliance with this section. 
A.  Standards for Reservation of Land. 
1.  Location of Land. Where a fire station, library, or other public use is shown in the general plan or applicable specific plan, the subdivider may be required by the city to reserve sites as determined by the city in compliance with the standards in the applicable plan. 
2.  Configuration. The reserved area shall be of a size and shape that will permit the balance of the property to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible. The land to be reserved shall be in multiples of streets and parcels that will permit an efficient division of the reserved area if it is not acquired within the period determined by subsection B following (Procedure for Reservation of Land). 
B.  Procedure for Reservation of Land. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall at the time of approval of the parcel or final map enter into a binding agreement with the subdivider to acquire the reserved area within two years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless a longer time is authorized by mutual agreement. 
C.  Purchase Price of Reserved Land. The purchase price shall be the market value of the land at the time the tentative map is filed, plus the property taxes against the reserved area from the date of the reservation, and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in maintaining the reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering the reserved area. 
D.  Termination of Reservation. If the public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved does not enter into a binding agreement as described in subsection B above (Procedure for Reservation of Land), the reservation shall automatically terminate. 
(Ord. No. 1869, § 2, 2-20-2013)  
17.58.060 - Right-of-way dedications. 
A.  Offers of Dedication Required. As a condition of tentative map approval, the subdivider shall dedicate or make an irrevocable offer of dedication of all parcels of land within the subdivision that are needed for streets, alleys, including access rights and abutters' rights, drainage, public utility easements, and other public easements. In addition, the subdivider shall improve or agree to improve all streets, alleys, including access rights and abutters' rights, drainage, public utility easements, and other public easements. 
B.  Improvements. The subdivider shall construct or agree to construct all improvements approved or required for the subdivision, including access rights and abutters' rights, in compliance with the city's improvement standards. 
C.  Rights-of-way, Generally. Rights-of-way shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the required improvements. In addition, where parcels front on a city-maintained road of insufficient width, or when the existing right-of-way is not deeded, the subdivider shall dedicate right-of-way sufficient for the ultimate facility. 
D.  Limited Access Designation. Whenever the review authority finds a safety hazard would be created as the result of direct access, the review authority may impose a requirement that any dedication or offer of dedication of a street shall include a waiver of direct access rights to the street from any property shown on a final map as abutting the street, and that if the dedication is accepted, the waiver shall become effective in compliance with the provisions of the waiver of direct access. The review authority may also require waivers of access to an existing street already dedicated which abuts the subdivision. 
E.  Transit Facilities. Dedications in fee simple or irrevocable offers of dedication of land within the subdivision may be required for local transit facilities including bus turnouts, benches, shelters, landing paths and similar items that directly benefit the residents of the subdivision if deemed necessary by the public works director, and if, in compliance with Map Act Section 66475.2: 
1.  The subdivision as shown on the tentative map has the potential for two hundred dwelling units or more if developed to the maximum density shown in the general plan; and 
2.  The review authority finds that transit services are or will, within a reasonable time period, be available to the subdivision. 
F.  Alternative Transportation Systems. Whenever the subdivision falls within an area designated for the development of bikeways, hiking or equestrian trails in the general plan, parks and recreation or bikeways master plans, applicable specific plan, or implementing legislation, the subdivider shall dedicate land as is necessary to provide for these ways.

Chapter 17.62 - REIMBURSEMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION 
 
17.62.010 - Findings and purpose. 
The council hereby finds and declares as follows: 
A.  The construction of new streets and water, sewer, and storm drains often benefits other properties. Benefits may occur through the provision of supplemental capacity (oversize lines) or installations across or opposite unserved property that would be required to make such improvements upon development or service connection. 
B.  The state of California, in Government Code Sections 66485 through 66489, requires that the city either pay for or enter into an agreement to reimburse the installing party, including an amount attributable to interest for such installations. To pay the costs as required by the reimbursement agreement, the city may collect funds from the other properties which benefit from such installations. 
C.  The city has adopted a development impact mitigation fee ordinance (Municipal Code Chapter 15.64), which provides for reimbursement and collection of funds from benefitting parcels under only a portion of the circumstances described in subsection A. 
D.  The purpose of Chapter 15.64 is to identify the improvements which are reimbursable under the development impact mitigation fee program and to provide a uniform reimbursement procedure for the cost of improvements which are to be reimbursed from other properties. For purposes of this article, "applicant" means the owner of the property for which the improvements are being installed or are required to be installed per the municipal code.

1.  Prohibited Activities for a Nonconforming Use. Owners or tenants of nonconforming uses shall not: 
a.  Enlarge, expand, extend, or increase the nonconforming use either on the same or adjoining parcel(s), except in compliance with the provisions of this development code; 
b.  Extend the nonconforming use to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by the use at the time it became nonconforming. A nonconforming use of a portion of the structure which otherwise conforms to the regulations of the subject zoning district shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of the structure nor changed except to a conforming use; 
c.  Move the nonconforming use, in whole or in part, to any other location on the subject parcel; or 
d.  Retain the benefits under this chapter if the nonconforming use ceases for 180 days or longer, in compliance with subsection 3 (Loss of Nonconforming Use Status), below. 
2.  Replacement of a Nonconforming Use. 
a.  A nonconforming use may be changed to a use of the same or more restrictive classification. 
b.  The replacement use shall serve as the "new bench mark" in terms of establishing the acceptable level of nonconformity.
