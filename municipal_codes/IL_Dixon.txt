1-1-7: TITLE, CHAPTER AND SECTION HEADINGS AND CATCHLINES:
(A) The catchlines of the several sections of this code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or

sections, including the catchlines, are amended or reenacted.
(B) Title, chapter and section headings contained in this code shall not be deemed to govern, limit, modify or in any manner affect the scope, meaning or

When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make

a unified code. For example, the codifier may:

(B) Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement and make changes in
such catchlines, headings and titles;
(C) Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material,
change existing section or other subdivision numbers;

section numbers to indicate the sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the code); and
(E) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new
chapters or sections inserted into the code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in
the supplement or already embodied in the code. (Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)

The zoning board of appeals as herein created is a body of limited powers. It shall hear and decide appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination, made by the administrative official charged with the enforcement of the zoning title1.
The board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or amend the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from to the extent
and in the manner that the board may decide to be fitting and proper in the premises, and to that end the board shall also have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken.
The board shall also hear and decide all matters referred to it or upon which it is required to pass under the zoning title.
When a property owner or his agent shows that a strict application of the terms of the zoning title relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings
or structures or the use of land imposes upon him practical difficulties or particular hardship, then the board may authorize such variations of the strict
application of the terms of the zoning title as are in harmony with its general purpose and intent when the board is satisfied, under the evidence heard
before it, that a granting of such variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some demonstrable
hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the provisions of the zoning title, or in the following instances:
(A) To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot in single ownership as shown on record prior to the date of
passage of the zoning title. (Ord. 120, 8-2-1955; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)

several districts, which map is made a part of the zoning title. (Ord. 120, 8-2-1955; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)

or shower, sink and flush toilet; and a kitchen equipped with sink.
4. Each dwelling unit shall comply with the requirements of the building code2 as to construction, minimum room sizes and room count.
5. The conversion will not alter the essential character of the property or the neighborhood. (Ord. 365, 8-22-1961; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-
2015)
In considering all appeals and all proposed variations to the zoning title the board shall, before granting any variation in a specific case, first
determine and make a finding of fact that the proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, unreasonably
increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals and welfare of the inhabitants of
the city.

inspector or to decide in favor of the applicant any matter upon which it is authorized by this chapter to render decision. (Ord. 120, 8-2-1955; amd.

(B) Upon the report of the zoning board of appeals, the council, without further public hearing, may adopt or deny any proposed variation or may refer the
report back to the board for further consideration. Any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval of the board of appeals shall not be
passed except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the elected members of the council. In making any variations the council shall be governed by
the same considerations and restrictions as the variations in particular instances under section 2-7-3 of this chapter. (Ord. 1882, 6-5-1995; amd. Ord.

ARTICLE A. TREE ORDINANCE1
2-11A-1: ESTABLISHMENT:
The Dixon tree ordinance is hereby established. Its purpose, requirements and authority are set forth in this article. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=443 59/357
2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this article, the following definitions are adopted:
ARBORIST: A tree care professional, who is licensed, trained, and educated in the proper care of trees.
CALIPER: Tree stem or branch diameter.
COMMISSION: The Dixon tree commission, appointed by the Dixon city council. A principal responsibility of this commission is to carry out provisions of
this article.
PRIVATE TREES: All trees on lands owned by individuals, businesses, or corporations.
PUBLIC TREES: Trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody plants lying on lands owned by the city of Dixon, state of Illinois, or Lee County, yet within the
city limits of Dixon (such as, but not limited to, boulevards, parks, greenbelts, and landscapes adjacent to state, municipal, and county buildings).
STREET TREES: Trees, shrubs, and all other woody plants lying between, above, or under power lines or utilities, and between curbs and sidewalks on
either side of all streets, avenues, or ways within the city.
URBAN FOREST: All street, public, and private trees within city limits, and potential tree planting sites for future developments. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006;
amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-3: PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of the Dixon tree ordinance to help restore, revitalize, and expand Dixon's urban forest by providing for the wise management of trees.
"Wise management" shall be defined as actions which demonstrate proper tree maintenance and care, planting, removal, protection, and the education of
residents and tree care professionals. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-4: AUTHORITY:
Inasmuch as this chapter established the Dixon tree commission to consult with the director of public works and thereby make recommendations to the city
council regarding tree removal and reforestation within the city limits of Dixon, this article further defines the commission's responsibilities as they relate to
expanding Dixon's urban forest, removal or pruning of hazardous trees, and the overall protection and improvement of tree health within the city
landscapes. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-5: APPLICABILITY:
The Dixon tree ordinance provides direction and authority regarding all street and public trees, trees for newly proposed residential and commercial
developments, as well as trees and wood products on private land where they constitute an immediate hazard or threat as described herein. (Ord. 2583, 5-
15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-6: DEVELOPMENT THAT PROMOTES THE URBAN FOREST:
(A) New residential and commercial development shall demonstrate vigorous planting and a successful establishment of trees. Planning for residential
developments should include planting street trees at forty foot (40') intervals. Since street corridors bordered with the same tree species favor rapid
spread of insect and disease, tree diversity in size, shape, and arrangement is encouraged.
(B) New parking lots greater than one acre should incorporate one 60-square foot tree planting site for each three thousand six hundred (3,600) square
feet of lot area (i.e., 1 acre = 208 feet x 208 feet = 12 sites/acre). Such sites will provide adequate growing room and allow for tree selections which
offer maximum shade (i.e., reference appendix B, large shade trees, attached to the ordinance codified herein). Accenting these trees with small
shrubs and flowers is encouraged (i.e., in contrast to simply mulching the remaining areas).
(C) New construction should take precautions to retain existing trees and flow with natural landscapes. Barriers should be used to protect existing and
newly planted trees, and site grading plans should route heavy equipment no closer than fifteen feet (15') from planting sites and outside the drip line of
existing trees. The Dixon tree commission shall review all development plans and make appropriate tree protection and planting recommendations.
(D) Developers and property owners are encouraged to follow a guide used by the Dixon tree commission, "Managing The Urban Forest", by the National
Arbor Day Foundation ("A Handbook For Tree Board Members", pages 19-29), appendix A, attached to the ordinance codified herein. (Ord. 2583, 5-
15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-7: REFORESTATION:
This article emphasizes that successful tree planting involves:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=443 60/357
(A) Planning Before Planting: Thoughtful consideration of many factors leads to successful survival (i.e., planting the right tree, in the right spot, at the right
time, and caring for trees after they are planted). For these reasons and more, the tree commission should consider developing, and the city council
support, a tree planting permit used for public plantings. Further, the Dixon tree commission should work with the director of public works to help
prepare annual work plans that consider these planting projects, prioritize them, and budget accordingly for their accomplishment.
(B) Funding To Purchase Trees And Ensure Their Health To Maturity:
1. Annual Expenditure: Tree City USA, as cited in this chapter which created the Dixon tree commission, requires that at least two dollars ($2.00) per
capita be spent annually on a community's forestry program.
2. Sharing The Green: The tree commission should work with city council, utilities, corporate entities, IDOT, and private citizens to cost-share expenses
for street tree and public plantings. Planting sites and tree selections for public trees should be finalized annually by December 1; bids for planting
stock should be accepted, then finalized by February 1 the following year. Public plantings should require stock with a minimum three inch (3")
caliper.
(C) Proper Selection: Appendix B, attached to the ordinance codified herein, is a recommended species list for public tree plantings, as well as species to
avoid for street tree plantings. Planting sites and conditions vary, but in most cases, trees should be mulched, staked, and stems protectively wrapped.
Deciduous trees should be planted prior to bud break or after leaf drop (i.e., October 15 to April 15). Evergreen plantings should be completed by mid
May, and since their roots and crowns are active through October, fall plantings of this tree group should be avoided. Evergreen trees, though not
recommended for street plantings, should be given high priority for park and open space projects since they provide year round shelter and cover for
wildlife.
(D) Spacing And Placement: Spacing and placement that promotes good tree vigor, yet does not harm property nor obstruct sightlines. Small trees should
be planted no closer than three feet (3') on either side from curbs or sidewalks; large class trees should allow four feet (4') on both sides. No tree
should be planted within thirty five feet (35') of street corners. Only small class trees (appendix B, attached to the ordinance codified herein) should be
planted under or within fifteen (15) lateral feet of overhead utilities; and only small class trees should be planted above underground utilities (such as
water, sewer, and gas lines) but more than five (5) lateral feet away from their network. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-
2015)
2-11A-8: TREE PROTECTION:
The tree commission shall publicly recruit property owners to voluntarily offer forth notice of trees which they believe to have landmark status by means of
age, size, species, or historic value. At the owner's consent, should a tree meet criteria developed by the commission, the tree will be certified and
designated as a Dixon historic tree. Such trees will be mapped and tagged and shall be removed only with consent from the property owner and tree
commission.
The removal of any public tree should be compensated for by replanting on a one for one basis. If a removed tree was planted in a poor location, or the
site is being altered, the public works director should consult with the tree commission for properly locating the replacement tree.
As the mere presence of natural woodlands improves our community and environment in countless ways, native public forests, such as Lowell Park, shall
be protected. Excluding wildfire, and such other events that may immediately threaten itself or other properties, management measures should be
excluded in Lowell Park. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-9: TREE HEALTH:
(A) Prevention And Suppression Of Harmful Agents: The Dixon tree commission will be aware and take measures to educate the entire community to
insects or diseases that pose a serious threat to Dixon's urban forest. The commission will alert and work to enforce Illinois statutes regarding such
agents. The commission may order the pruning or removal of any street or public tree which poses an imminent physical hazard to persons or property.
In addition, as directed by Illinois statutes, the city council may order the removal of wood products, any tree, public or private, confirmed to have such
pests, disease carrying agents, or hazards as identified in the following titles and Illinois statutes:
505 Illinois Compiled Statutes 90/1 through 90/30, insect and pest and plant disease act
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-20-11, Dutch elm disease (control and eradication)
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-20-12, Dutch elm disease (removal of trees; costs)
65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/11-20-11, control and eradication of fungus (Illinois municipal code)
30 Illinois Compiled Statutes 735/1 through 735/7, urban and community forestry assistance act
20 Illinois Compiled Statutes 805/63, protection of forests
(B) The State Of Our Forest: The tree commission, public works, and parks shall be funded beyond the limits of volunteer time and donated expenses, to
accurately assess and inventory Dixon's public trees by the year 2010. Surveys should note species, size, age, vigor, location, presence of insect and
disease, and checkoff boxes for "requires immediate attention". Residents may also volunteer to participate, for public record, for their own trees. As
individual tree surveys are mapped and logged into a central network, updated data should be used to adapt, prioritize, and budget citywide tree care.
(C) Pruning And Removal Of Street And Public Trees: The tree commission should be notified and have authority regarding the removal of state mandated
insect and disease infested trees on city property. For all other tree situations on city owned property, the commission will serve to consult, support, and
make recommendations to the director of public works and park district director, as called for in this chapter. Removal of hazardous or diseased trees
should be carried out within sixty (60) days from the time of discovery. Public works and parks directors shall annually request funds specifically for tree
removal and pruning. It should be a duty of the tree commission to examine procedures and permits for the removal or pruning of public trees, both
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=443 61/357
internally (i.e., city owned resources and personnel) and externally (i.e., private resources and arborists). These findings should then be presented for
review by the city council.
(D) Guides To Promote Tree Health:
1. Ensure city workers are properly trained and confirm that private contractors are properly licensed in urban tree care. For work done internally and
externally, utilize a permit system to specify all requirements. It should be the duty of the tree commission to promote continuing education seminars
for public and private tree care professionals.
2. There shall be no "topping" of street or public trees. "Topping" is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inch (3")
diameter within the tree's crown; the normal canopy is amputated, and this eliminates the tree's natural development. Temporary exceptions to this
are in emergency situations resulting from storm breakage or wind throw.
3. Pruning enhances tree health, eliminates hazards, and, timed correctly, reduces or prevents harmful insects and disease. The city's budget should
allocate funds each year to bid out tree maintenance by local arborists. Public works and parks personnel shall consult with commission members to
jointly decide where these funds will be spent, as well as provide before and after photo documentation to support these projects to the city council.
The highest priorities for such work are trees obstructing views near street signs, or at intersections, and those trees that have rot, wounds, or
substantial deadwood that threaten persons or property.
4. Stumps of all street tree removals shall be ground to below surface level or removed.
5. To allow proper healing prior to insect activity, planned pruning should be completed during or near tree dormancy. Street trees should allow for at
least an eight foot (8') clearance over sidewalks and fifteen feet (15') over streets. All branches should be pruned only at the nodes or crotches, just
above, and parallel to, the branch collar. Limbs greater than two inch (2") diameter should be pruned with at least two (2) cuts, the last of which
should abut the branch collar. Pruning cuts should guard against tearing the cambium layer; and in most cases, sealing treatments of these sites
serves little benefit and is not necessary (exceptions to this would include sealing off further rot or decay).
6. Pruning or removal recommendations shall be alert to wildlife activity and improving, not removing, habitat. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964,
4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-10: PRIVATE LANDOWNER RESPONSIBILITY:
Whereas Illinois statutes provide for urban forestry assistance2, control of harmful tree insects and disease3, and protection of persons and property from
hazards4, the city of Dixon shall have the right to cause the removal or pruning of any dead or diseased tree, wood products, or limbs on private property
when these objects pose a hazard to other persons, property, or plants. Following written notification, property owners shall have sixty (60) days to comply
or thirty (30) days to file a written appeal with the city council. Failure to do either of these shall give the city, through its designated representative, the
authority to remove such tree and collect such costs from the property owner.
When disputes occur, or if immediate and critical decisions are needed concerning the future of a tree and its impact on others, being aware of several
factors can help to resolve the issue:
(A) Obtain an unbiased appraisal of the situation from a professional arborist.
(B) The Illinois DNR, division of forestry, should be utilized by the city and residents for consultation and confirmation of state mandated tree insects or
diseases.
(C) When necessary, as provided for by Illinois statutes, the city, or its designated representative, may enter onto private property to examine a tree.
(D) In almost all applications, though it will not often eliminate insect or disease, pruning a tree is less costly than removing a tree.
(E) Dead trees eventually weaken and fall. Prompt removal of such trees (i.e., within 60 days) saves money in the long run and reduces future tree losses
and liabilities. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-11: ARBORIST LICENSE AND INSURANCE:
Any for profit business that is selling nursery stock, planting, pruning, removing, spraying, and otherwise treating trees or woody plants within Dixon city
limits, should not do so without first obtaining an arborist's license from the city. Licenses shall be free of charge and available beginning in 2007. Before
any license is issued, applicants shall provide proof to the city of workers' compensation and liability insurance in minimum amounts of one million dollars
($1,000,000.00) for bodily injury or death and one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for property damage. Applicants will be given a copy of the
Dixon tree ordinance, be made aware of resources available to them to answer tree care concerns, and be asked to indemnify the city for any legal suits
resulting from their actions. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)
2-11A-12: PENALTIES AND FINES FOR VANDALISM AND DAMAGE TO TREES:
Any person who is found to cause significant harm, injury, or death to any public or private tree, or any person who is found to have trespassed and stolen
woody plants from another's property, shall be liable to pay the property owner the full replacement value as determined by certified appraisal methods
specified in the latest revision of "A Guide To The Professional Evaluation Of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs, And Evergreens", as published by the
International Society Of Arboriculture. (Ord. 2583, 5-15-2006; amd. Ord. 2964, 4-20-2015, eff. 5-4-2015)

days of the date the permit is issued, whichever is sooner. The backfill material shall consist of the excavated material or of trench backfill, as herein
specified. All backfill material shall be deposited in the trench or excavation in such a manner as not to damage the utility. The filling of the trench shall be
carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe in such a manner that injurious side pressures do not occur. The backfill for trenches and excavations
made in the subgrade and for all trenches outside of the subgrade where the inner edge of the trench is within two feet (2') of the edge of the pavement,
curb, or gutter, shall be made with trench backfill material unless the excavated material meets the requirements of the city.
All backfill material up to the height of twelve inches (12") above the pipe shall be carefully deposited in uniform layers not exceeding four inches (4") thick
(loose measure). The material in each layer shall be firmly compacted by ramming or tamping with tools approved by the city, in such a manner as not to
disturb or injure the pipe. The backfilling above this height, except trench backfill or excavated material meeting the requirements of state highway backfill
material, shall be done by one of the following methods:
Method 1: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding twelve inches (12") thick (loose material), and each layer shall be compacted by
ramming or tamping with tools approved by the city.
Method 2: The material shall be deposited in uniform layers not exceeding twelve inches (12") thick (loose measure), and each layer shall be either
inundated or deposited in water.
Method 3: The trench shall be backfilled with loose material, and settlement secured by introducing water through holes jetted into the backfill to a point
approximately two feet (2') above the top of the pipe. The holes shall be spaced as directed by the inspector but shall be no farther than six feet (6') apart.
The water shall be injected at a pressure just sufficient to sink the holes at a moderate rate of speed. The pressure shall be such that the water will not cut

1519, 2-20-1990)
3-8-3: CONNECTION WITH WATER MAIN:
The Water Division will make the necessary service connection at the water main, the cost of which is to be paid by the owner or contractor. The cost is to
be regulated by the Water Division in accordance with the prevailing cost of labor and materials at the time of installation or replacement.
All new connections from a family dwelling to any water main of the City shall cost the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for services up to one
inch (1"). This section, however, does not apply to installations where the cost of such installation has been paid by the developer of a subdivision, or such
other person as may be applicable pursuant to section 3-8-12 of this chapter.
All commercial and industrial connections to any water main of the City shall require a one thousand dollar ($1,000.00) connection fee and a two hundred
fifty dollar ($250.00) tap fee. In addition, there shall be a two hundred fifty dollar ($250.00) fee if the tapping sleeve and valve are put on by the Water
Division. All materials shall be furnished by the owner or contractor.
The owner shall lay and maintain the service pipe from the water main to the premises and shall, for single-family dwellings, install a Mueller H-15155 or
A.Y. McDonald 6107BQ curb stop in an easily accessible place near the wall where the service pipe enters the building. For multiple-family dwellings, the
owner shall install a separate outside shutoff for each dwelling and a "lock type" stop valve in an easily accessible place near the wall where the service
pipe enters the building. The owner shall also install a valve on the outlet side of the meter. The owner shall install, on every service pipe, a curb stop and
curb box. The curb stop shall be located within the street right-of-way and shall be approximately six feet (6') from the property line.
In the event that repairs to the water service are necessary, existing meter pits must be replaced. The meters must be moved inside the building and the
pits filled in and abandoned.
All new and repaired water service pipes two inches (2") in diameter and smaller shall be type K soft copper pipe or SDR9 ADS polyflex (200 psi rating)
one inch (1") or greater in diameter. All service pipes larger than two inches (2") in diameter shall be ductile iron thickness, Class No. 52 cable bond. The

the inspection and approval of the City building inspector, consulting engineer or authorized agent of the Water Division.
The type and manufacture of fire hydrants, valves, street boxes and water meters must be in accordance with standard specifications approved by the
Water Division. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-4: WATER METERS:
All water used by every water customer shall be measured and recorded with a water meter. The water meter shall be supplied and installed by the Water
Division and shall be and remain at all times the property of the Water Division. The Water Division will install meters that are one inch (1") and smaller into
completed plumbing. All other meters shall be installed by the owner and inspected and approved by the Water Division after installation. For all new
installations, the utility service fee and the costs of installation shall be paid in full, together with hook-on fees and any other fee due to the Water Division
at City Hall before installation shall be made. All new installations or remodeling of properties shall have a smartpoint and, in the Water Manager's
discretion, a touchpad. The water meter shall be installed at a location protected from freezing or heat and other hazards, and the outside reading device
(remote transmitter), if any, shall be installed at a point that is visible from the front or side street. It shall be the customer's responsibility to keep the meter
from being damaged or frozen. If such damage or freezing occurs, it shall be the customer's responsibility to pay for the costs of replacement or repair,
including any applicable charges or fees provided for herein as a result. The cost of all water meters shall be established from time to time by the Water
Manager. Forty five (45) days after installation of a new meter, the prior meter will be disposed of by the Water Division. Customers shall have the
opportunity, during such forty five (45) day period, to dispute the accuracy of the removed meter. Any commercial building served with water service shall
include in the meter installation a proper bypass, approved by the Water Division, which allows for continued use of water when a meter is removed for
maintenance or testing. Lock valves shall also be included on such bypasses at the owner's expense.
Charges for testing residential, commercial and industrial meters shall be based on the actual cost for labor and materials expended by the Water Division.
Should the customer desire the test to be made, the Water Division employee will, in the customer's presence, seal the meter before he leaves the
customer's presence. If the results of the water meter test indicate that the meter is measuring higher than the standards set forth by the American Water
Works Association (AWWA), then the meter shall be repaired or replaced at no cost to the customer and all testing fees shall be reimbursed.
When the water meter fails to register, the charge for water used during the period of non-registration will be determined from an average corresponding
period. When such an average is obviously unfair to either the customer or the Water Division, an average will be agreed to by both parties. If both parties
cannot agree, all the facts will be submitted to the City Council and their decision will be final.
Illegal use of water or of property of the Water Division or of the meter devices shall result in criminal prosecution. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-5: PROTECTION OF WATER DIVISION PROPERTY:
All piping, gauges, appliances, equipment and other devices installed by the Water Division, and all water meters, regardless of who performed the

responsible for such property in the case of loss or damages. Only authorized agents of the Water Division will be permitted to remove, install or replace
such property. The owner or customer shall maintain free access to all Water Division property. The owner or customer shall not store or construct any
obstacles which will interfere with the reading, repairing or removal of the water meter. The owner shall keep his or her curb box and curb stop free from
obstruction so that the water can be turned on or off whenever necessary without delay. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-6: ACCESS TO PREMISES:
Authorized agents of the Water Division shall at all reasonable hours have access to the premises for the purpose of inspecting the customer's installation
and of reading, repairing, testing, terminating service, restoring service or removing the water meter or other Water Division property. All authorized agents
of the Water Division can and shall present an identification card if asked to do so. Upon the presentation of the card, the authorized agent shall have free
access at any reasonable hour to any premises supplied with City water for the purpose of making an inspection of the entire supply, upon the premises or
reading or repairing the water meter or other Water Division property. Failure to allow access to premises will result in termination of service. Cost of
terminating service and service restoration will be the responsibility of the property owner. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-7: DISCONTINUING OF SERVICE FOR REPAIRS:
When it is necessary for the Water Division to interrupt water service for the purpose of repairing or extending the main, it will endeavor to give notice of
interruption and shut off the water at a time when it will cause the least inconvenience to the customer. In case of a break in the main or pumping
equipment requiring an immediate shutdown or interruption of service, the Water Division shall not be required to provide prior notice to its customers. All
boilers or tanks on the customer's premises that are connected directly with the service pipe shall be provided with reduced pressure zone backflow
preventers that adequately prevent their collapse in the event water is suddenly shut off. Only persons authorized by the Water Manager shall turn on or
off water valves or curb stops. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-8: NOTICE TO PLUMBERS AND EXCAVATORS:
All plumbers and contractors shall contact the Manager of the Water Division prior to performing any excavating. The Water Manager or his or her
authorized representatives will mark the appropriate location of any underground water main or service. The plumber or contractor shall take every
precaution to prevent damage to the water main or service pipe. If any damages do occur, the plumber or person that caused the damage shall pay the
cost of repairing same to the Water Division. The person causing the damage to the water main or service shall also be responsible for any other liability
resulting from the broken service pipe or water main. No person shall tap, repair, change or otherwise disturb the mains or service pipes without the
permission of the Water Manager or his or her authorized representative. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)

The setting fee shall include the installation and removal of a hydrant meter. The deposit will be applied to the final water bill. In addition, all tanker
trucks must fill at the water plant and not at the hydrants. No hydrant may be operated without the prior permission of the Water Manager or his or her
designee. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-10: PAYMENT OF WATER BILLS:
(A) Billings:

(B) Person Responsible For Payment: The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof, and the user of the water service shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay for the service to such premises and the service is furnished to the premises by the City only upon the condition that the owner of the
premises, occupant and user of the service are jointly and severally liable thereof to the City.
(C) Lien Notice Of Delinquency:
1. Lien: In the event charges for water service remain unpaid for twenty two (22) days after rendition of the bill for such services, such charges shall be
deemed and are hereby declared to be delinquent, and thereafter such delinquency may constitute a lien upon the real estate for which service is

(a) A legal description of the premises served;
(b) The amount of money due for such water service; and
(c) The date when such amount became delinquent.
2. Notification: If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the City has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the
premises, if his or her address be known to the Water Division, whenever the bill remains unpaid for a period of twenty two (22) days after rendition
of the bill. The notice shall be sufficient to inform the owner of the premises that the charges or rates have become delinquent and that unpaid
charges may create a lien on the real estate under subsection (C)1 of this section. The procedure for customer disputes contained in subsection 3-8-
16(E) of this chapter shall be available to the owner of the premises should the owner wish to dispute imposition of the lien on the premises where
service was provided. Failure of the City to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right of the City to
file and foreclose the lien for unpaid bills, as provided in this chapter.
3. Foreclosure Of Lien: Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be foreclosed in the manner as provided by the Illinois Compiled Statutes.
4. Costs: In all cases where the charges or rates established under this chapter become delinquent, and it becomes necessary to file a statement
thereof in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds, there shall be added as part of such delinquent charge the Recorder's fee for the filing of said
statement and the costs verifying the legal description of the property on which such lien is attached and the City Clerk is hereby directed and
authorized to include said additions in her sworn statements showing such delinquency.

3-8-11: CESSATION OF WATER SERVICE:
Whenever a premises is to be vacated or closed for any period of time, application shall be made to the Water Division to have the water supply shut off.
The Water Division shall then shut off the water and remove (if applicable) and read the meter. The water customer will then be given a bill based on the
meter reading, along with any additional fees or charges permitted or required by this chapter. If the customer is moving from the premises, the deposit will
be applied to the final bill. (Ord. 3110, 9-17-2018)
3-8-12: WATER MAIN EXTENSIONS FOR NEW SUBDIVISIONS AND OTHERWISE:
All subdividers shall submit plans for water main extension to the Water Manager for approval. The plans shall indicate the size and the location of all
water mains, valves and fire hydrants. The plans shall also indicate the size and location of all lots and streets. After the plans have been approved by the
Water Manager, Consulting Engineers, Building Official, and the Fire Chief, the plans must then be submitted to the Illinois EPA Division of Public Water
Supplies, Springfield, Illinois, for approval. No work shall be started on any extension until approval has been received by the Water Division and a
construction permit is received. A new installation shall not be put in service until after an operating permit has been received by the Water Division. The
entire water system shall be installed by and paid for by the subdivider.
Fire hydrants shall be located at the corner of each block and on the end of all dead end mains. Intermediate hydrants will be required on long blocks as
required by the Water Manager or City Engineer. All hydrants must be set so that the center of the nozzle should be not less than eighteen inches (18")
from ground level. The water main shall be extended to the extremities of the subdivision so that future water main extensions will not require excavation in
the subdivision.
RW valves will be installed on the lead to all fire hydrants. RW valves shall be located on all but one of the branches at each intersection. In no event shall
RW valves be located more than eight hundred feet (800') apart. The water main shall be connected into the existing water system at every possible
location. Dead end water mains shall be avoided wherever possible.
In such cases where the subdivider is required to provide larger diameter mains for future expansion and said subdivider believes he is entitled to
additional reimbursement, he shall appear before the City Council. The City Council will study the facts of the case and may or may not give additional
reimbursement. The reimbursement is to be made based on the size of the pipe which the City Council may require be installed and the size main which
must be installed in the subdivision to satisfy the fire flow in each subdivision or instance. This would be based on eight inch (8") minimum size of the
main. The installation of the water main shall be inspected and the entire installation shall be approved by the Water Division, the consulting engineer, and
the Manager of the Water Division prior to final acceptance of the subdivision by the City. In such cases where, after a showing of good cause by the
subdivider that the requirements of this section or of section 3-8-12-1 of this chapter cannot be met, the Water Manager may approve such suitable
replacements as he or she may allow in his or her absolute discretion.

owner is responsible for repair or replacement. If the property owner has not taken action within twenty four (24) hours after the owner has been
notified, the Water Division shall disconnect or shall cause the service to be disconnected. The Water Division is authorized to undertake said
disconnection by using Water Division employees or by employing an independent contractor to perform such service. The property owner shall be
responsible for and shall pay all costs incurred by the Water Division in disconnecting said service. If the Water Division employees disconnect said
service, costs shall be calculated on a time and material basis; if the Water Division employs an independent contractor to perform said service, the
amount of the charges incurred by the City shall be paid by the property owner. The property owner shall make payment in full within thirty (30) days of
receipt of said bill. If payment is not made within said thirty (30) days, the water service shall be disconnected until the bill is paid in full, plus payment
of a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee. The owner shall also be responsible for any fees for re-establishing service.
(B) Pipe One Inch Or Smaller: If a leak or break occurs in a water service pipe having a one inch (1") or smaller diameter and said water service pipe
supplies more than one premises, then, at the time repairs are undertaken, each property owner shall cause an individual service line to be installed
from the main to the building on the premises. The cost of such installation shall be split between the property owners.
(C) Serious Damage: The Water Division has the right to shut off any service leak or break at any time that said leak or break, in the opinion of the Water
Division, is causing or could cause serious damage to the street or property. The property owner shall pay the Water Division on a time and material

improvements program where the street surface is completely removed and thereafter replaced with either a portland cement concrete surface or a
bituminous concrete surface. The property owner may select a plumber of his or her choice to replace the water service or it will be replaced by the
Water Division at the owner's expense. Water service shall also be extended to vacant lots containing fifty feet (50') or more frontage. If the Water
Division performs the work, it will charge three hundred dollars ($300.00) to replace each gooseneck and eight hundred dollars ($800.00) to replace
water service from the water main to the curb stop. The owner shall pay the full amount of the bill within thirty (30) days to the Water Division. Failure to
make said payment shall result in the water service being terminated until said bill is paid in full, plus a fifty dollar ($50.00) fee.

any property where a cross connection exists in violation of this Code. The Water Division may take such other measures as necessary to eliminate
any danger of contamination of the public water supply system. Water service to such property shall not be restored until such cross connection has
been eliminated. The Water Division may immediately disconnect any water service, after verbal notice to the occupant of the premises, when there
exists an imminent danger of harmful contamination to the public water supply system at any premises served by the City water system. Within a
reasonable time after such immediate disconnection, the Water Division shall provide written notification to the customer of the cause for
disconnection. Immediate disconnection without notice to any party can be effected to prevent actual or anticipated contamination or pollution of the
public water supply, provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Water Manager or the State Environmental Protection Agency, such action is
required to prevent actual or potential contamination or pollution of the public water supply. All expenses incurred for the disconnection and restoration

(D) Connections; How Made: Approved types of house service connections shall be one of the following:
Approved pipe and fittings shall be ductile iron, concrete pipe, vitrified clay, asbestos cement, polyvinyl chloride, or acrylonitrile-butadiene-stryene, PVC
pipe shall be a minimum schedule 40. All materials for building connections shall be approved by the building official before installation and shall meet
the requirements as established in the latest edition of the State Plumbing Code.
Service sewers shall be connected to the tee, wye, or riser provided in the public sewer where such is available, utilizing approved fittings or adapters
installed in accordance with manufacturer's specifications. Where no tee, wye, or riser is provided or available, connection shall be made by machine
made tap and suitable saddle, or other method as approved by the building official.
Type 1: Vitrified clay wye branches installed in the main sewer at the time of construction. Connections to existing wye branches shall be made with an
approved type of joint material of the bituminous type or an approved compression coupling. The connection shall be completely watertight. No
connection shall be allowed to any damaged wye branch. If damage occurs during the making of the connection, the wye branch shall be taken out of
the main sewer by the plumber and replaced either by another undamaged wye or by straight vitrified clay pipe. If straight pipe is used in the
replacement, other approved connection methods shall be used. Concrete encasement of the wye branch, connection joint, or any other part of the
connection shall not be deemed watertight and shall not be allowed as a method of repairing a damaged joint.
Type 2: Connection of the saddle type installed in the main sewer: Connections of this type shall be made in a smooth, round hole, machine drilled into
the main sewer pipe. The fitting used in the connection shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that no protrusion of the fitting into the main sewer
pipe shall result. The connector shall fit perfectly the contour of the inside of the sanitary sewer and shall be specifically designed to fit the particular
size main sewer pipe into which the connection is made. The machine drilled hole shall be of such size to provide one-eighth inch (1/8") clearance
between the outside of the fitting and the hole. The space thus provided shall be completely filled with joint material. The space between the shoulder
of the fitting and the face of the main sewer pipe shall be one-eighth inch (1/8") thick and this space shall also be completely filled with joint material.
The joint material used for the type 2 house service connection shall be completely waterproof and shall be capable of withstanding any condition of
stress or strain likely to be encountered in normal sanitary sewer construction or maintenance. Concrete encasement will not be considered waterproof.
The fitting shall be manufactured of either cast aluminum alloy or vitrified clay and shall be capable of receiving all normally used types of pipes for
house service connections.
The type 2 fitting and drilling machine herein described shall be of the type manufactured by Smith & Loveless, Division-Union Tank Car Company,
Lenexa, Kansas, or the approved equal.
(E) Type 1 And 2 Connections; When And Where Used: Type 1 connections may be used in existing sanitary sewers when wye branches previously
installed are readily and conveniently available. If existing wye branches cannot be found readily or are not located properly for providing the needed
service, type 2 connections shall be made. When new sanitary sewers are constructed, type 1 connections may be made in cases where the
connection to the house is made during construction and before backfilling of the sanitary main sewer trench. Type 2 connections shall be made in all
cases where house services are installed subsequent to construction and backfilling operations.
(F) Enforcement: All connections shall be subject to inspection by the sewer inspecting agent of the City, and permits shall be required for each and every
connection. (Ord. 1546, 7-16-1990)

3-9-27: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGES AND COLLECTION OF CHARGES:
(A) Wastewater Service Charges:
1. Basis For Wastewater Service Charge: The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the City
shall consist of a fixed administrative service charge, a basic user charge, a debt service charge, a capital improvement charge (for users located
outside the City limits only), and a surcharge, if applicable.
(a) Fixed Administrative Service Charge: The fixed administrative service charge is for the administrative expenses of the sewerage system and is
computed by dividing the budgeted fixed administrative costs by the number of users. Through further division, the monthly and/or quarterly fixed
administrative service charges can be computed.
(b) Basic User Charge: The basic user charge is for the variable operation, maintenance and replacement expenses of the sewerage system and is
based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal domestic concentrations:
(1) A five (5) day, twenty degrees centigrade (20°C) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/L).
(2) A suspended solids (SS) content of three hundred twenty milligrams per liter (320 mg/L).
The basic user charge is computed by multiplying the water/wastewater volume in one gallon by the basic user rate which is computed as
follows:
(1) Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including equipment replacement.
(2) Estimate the billable wastewater volume.
(3) Compute the costs (rate) per one hundred (100) gallons of the billable volume.
(c) Debt Service Charge: The debt service charge is for revenue bond debt retirement including principal, interest and cover costs, and is based on a
water usage as recorded by the water and/or sewage meters. The debt service charge is computed by multiplying the water/wastewater volume in
one hundred (100) gallons by a debt service charge rate which is computed as follows:
(1) Estimate the projected annual revenue needed for revenue bond debt retirement.
(2) Estimate the billable wastewater volume.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=443 94/357
(3) Compute the cost (rate) per one gallon of billable volume.
(d) Capital Improvement Charge (For Users Located Outside The City Limits Only): The capital improvement charge is a charge levied to users
located outside the City limits for the use of the reserve wastewater treatment plant and sewer system capacity. The capital improvement charges
are based on water usage as recorded by water and/or wastewater meters and is computed by multiplying the water and/or wastewater volume in
one gallon by a capital improvement charge rate which is computed as follows:
(1) Estimate the annual replacement value of the wastewater treatment plant and sanitary/combined sewer system.
(2) Estimate the value of the existing, in service, wastewater treatment plant and sanitary/combined sewer system and subtract all grants and/or
special assessments. Multiply this value by an annual return on investment of 6.5 percent.
(3) Compute the capital improvement charge rate by dividing the design flow of 4.5 million gallons per day (mgd) into the annual replacement value
plus the return on investment component of the wastewater treatment plant and sanitary/combined sewer system.
(e) Surcharge: Except where specifically allowed by special agreement(s), a surcharge will be levied to all users whose wastes exceed the normal
domestic concentrations for BOD5 of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/L) and suspended solids of three hundred twenty milligrams per liter
(320 mg/L). The surcharge will be based on a usage as recorded by water and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the two hundred
milligrams per liter (200 mg/L) and three hundred twenty milligrams per liter (320 mg/L) concentration for BOD5 and suspended solids respectively.
Subsection (A)13 of this section specifies the procedure to compute a surcharge.
2. Annual Review Of Charges: The adequacy of wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised periodically to reflect
changes in the fixed administrative costs; operation, maintenance and replacement costs; and/or capital improvement costs.
3. Annual User Notification: The users of wastewater treatment services shall be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that
portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation, maintenance and replacement.
4. Measurement Of Flows: The volume of flow used for computing user charges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest increments
of one gallon.
(a) All users of the sewerage system discharging water into the sewerage system who procure any part, or all, of their water from a source other than
the waterworks system of the City, all or part of which is discharged into the sewerage system, shall, if directed by the City, install and maintain at
his, her or its expense, water meters of a type approved by the building official of the City for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these sources.
(b) Devices for measuring the volume of wastewater discharged may be required by the building official if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.
(c) Water meters and metering devices for determining the volume of the wastewater discharge shall be installed, owned and maintained by the
person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the consent of the building official.

with the following:
(A) Sewers:
1. Sanitary sewers with laterals extending to lot lines shall be installed to comply with specifications established by the engineer and shall be connected
to the sanitary disposal system of the city if reasonably accessible; otherwise, to a specially constructed sanitary sewage disposal plant in
accordance with plans acceptable to the city. The sanitary sewers shall be designed to carry all of the sewage flow within the drainage basin within
the limits of one and one-half (11/2) miles from the corporate limits of the city. The sanitary sewer shall be sized to carry a peak flow of two and onehalf
(21/2) times the average flow of one hundred (100) gallons per capita per day. Unless there is supporting data to the contrary, the sewers shall
be designed for sixteen (16) people per acre. A subdivision plat shall in no case be approved, which shall be dependent upon individual septic tanks,
except where lots therein contain not less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet each, and the installation meets the requirements of the state and
county health department specifications for the construction and installation of individual septic systems.
2. Storm sewers shall be constructed throughout the entire subdivision which shall be separate and independent of the sanitary sewer system and
which shall provide an adequate outlet, or connection with the storm sewer system of the city. The storm sewers shall be extended to the extremities
of the subdivision for easy access by future upstream developments. The storm sewers shall be sized to carry the runoff from the entire drainage
area according to the rational runoff formula Q = CiA where Q is the volume of stormwater in cubic feet per second; C is the runoff coefficient, which
is that part of the rainfall rate which will contribute to the runoff rate; i is the average intensity of the rainfall in inches per hour during the time required
for all parts of the watershed to contribute to runoff; and A is the area of the drainage basin in acres. Where the major portion of the drainage basin is
or will be a residential area, a factor of eight-tenths (0.8) shall be used for the product of C and i. When commercial, industrial or other large runoff
areas are within the drainage area, the values used for C and i shall be approved by the city engineer. (Ord. 680, 1-17-1972)
3. After all sewer and water lines installed in city streets have been fully tested and approved by the city, and paid for by the subdivider, the subdivider
shall be required to execute a bill of sale transferring ownership of said sewer and water lines to the city. (Ord. 1061, 12-1-1980)
(B) Street Improvements:
1. Grades of streets shall not be in excess of five percent (5%) on primary streets, nor in excess of eight percent (8%) on other streets except in cases
of necessity and with the permission of the plan commission.
2. All streets within the corporate limits shall be improved with roadways, bounded by integral concrete curbs and gutters, to an overall width in
accordance with the following minimum dimensions:
Type Of Street
Dedicated
Street Width Roadway Width
Primary streets Conform to major street plan and in no instance less than 100 feet
2 24-foot roadways, divided by a median strip
Secondary or collector streets
66 feet 45 feet BC-BC
Minor streets 60 feet 37 feet BC-BC
3. Roadways shall be constructed of such base material and surfacing as to be suitable for the volume and character of traffic expected to use the
street, and as approved by the city officials and the city engineer. The surface shall be finished by constructing a minimum three inch (3") combined
hot mix asphalt binder and surface course conforming to section 406 of the state of Illinois, "Standard Specifications For Road And Bridge
Construction", adopted January 1, 2007, or latest revision thereof.
4. Curbs and gutters on minor residential streets shall be type B6.18 combination concrete curb and gutter in accordance with IDOT standards, not less
than twenty five inches (25") in overall width.
5. Stormwater inlets shall be provided within the roadway improvement at points approved by the city engineer.
6. All curb corners shall have a radii of not less than fifteen feet (15') and at important intersections not less than twenty five feet (25'). All curb corners
shall be designed for the appropriate design vehicle for that location.
7. Roadway improvements in subdivisions lying outside the corporate city area, but within the one and one-half (11/2) mile area, shall conform to
standards of improvements suitable for the character of the proposed subdivision development, recommended by the plan commission and approved
by the governing authorities.

the watercourse. (Ord. 2773, 2-1-2010)
7-10-11: VARIANCES:
Whenever the standards of this chapter place undue hardship on a specific development proposal, the applicant may apply to the zoning board of appeals
for a variance. The zoning board of appeals shall review the applicant's request for a variance and shall submit its recommendation to the city council. The
city council may attach such conditions to granting of a variance as it deems necessary to further the intent of this chapter.

1. The repair or rehabilitation is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure; and
2. The repair or rehabilitation will not result in the structure being removed as a certified historic structure. (Ord. 2773, 2-1-2010)
7-10-12: DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY:
The degree of protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does
not imply that development either inside or outside of the floodplain will be free from flooding or damage. This chapter does not create liability on the part
of the city of Dixon or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from proper reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
made lawfully thereunder. (Ord. 2773, 2-1-2010)
7-10-13: PENALTY:
Failure to obtain a permit for development in the floodplain or failure to comply with the conditions of a permit or a variance shall be deemed to be a
violation of this chapter. Upon due investigation, the building official may determine that a violation of the minimum standards of this chapter exists. The
building official shall notify the owner in writing of such violation.
(A) If such owner fails after ten (10) days' notice to correct the violation:
1. The city of Dixon shall make application to the circuit court for an injunction requiring conformance with this chapter or make such other order as the
court deems necessary to secure compliance with this chapter;

4. The city of Dixon shall record a notice of violation on the title of the property.
(B) The building official shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a wilful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a standard flood insurance policy to be suspended.
The building official is authorized to issue an order requiring the suspension of the subject development. The stop work order shall be in writing,
indicate the reason for the issuance, and shall order the action, if necessary, to resolve the circumstances requiring the stop work order. The stop work
order constitutes a suspension of the permit.
No site development permit shall be permanently suspended or revoked until a hearing is held by the zoning board of appeals. Written notice of such
hearing shall be served on the permittee and shall state:
1. The grounds for the complaint, reasons for suspension or revocation; and
2. The time and place of the hearing.
At such hearing the permittee shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning board of
appeals shall determine whether the permit shall be suspended or revoked.
(C) Nothing herein shall prevent the city of Dixon from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith
shall accrue to the person or persons responsible. (Ord. 2773, 2-1-2010)
7-10-14: ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS:
This chapter repeals and replaces other ordinances adopted by the city council to fulfill the requirements of the national flood insurance program including:
ordinances 2073 passed 3-16-1998, 2100 passed 7-6-1998 and 2304 passed 3-5-2001. However, this chapter does not repeal the original resolution or
ordinance adopted to achieve eligibility in the program. Nor does this chapter repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. Where this chapter and other ordinance easements, covenants or deed restrictions conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail. (Ord. 2773, 2-1-2010)

checkpoints. (Ord. 2957, 1-5-2015)

and manufacturing and other specified uses.

buildings necessary to provide adequate light and air, and to protect the public health.
E. To establish building lines and the location of buildings designed for residential, business, manufacturing
or other uses with such areas.
F. To fix reasonable standards to which buildings or structures shall conform therein.
G. To prohibit uses, buildings or structures incompatible with the character of development or intended uses
within specified zoning districts.

B. Except as otherwise provided by this Title, no building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied, and

structurally altered, unless it conforms with the provisions of this Title governing the zoning district in

614:
RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
A. The Comprehensive Plan shall be advisory only and, in and of itself, shall not be construed or interpreted

of private property should rely on recommendations in the Master Plan being translated into presently
effective regulations. The decision as to whether and when particular elements of the Comprehensive
Plan will be implemented in regulatory ordinances is reserved for the City Council to make from time to
time taking into account, among other factors, the type of development that is contemplated and the
timing of such development in the context of the best advantage of the City as a whole.

6-3-12: Accessory Uses Outside Commercial Buildings
6-3-1: SCOPE OF REGULATIONS
A. No building or structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor
shall any building or land be used for any purpose other than that which is permitted in the district in which
the building or land is located.
6-3-2: SEPARABILITY
A. If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision of this ordinance shall be adjudged by
any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgement shall not affect, impair, invalidate, or
nullify the remainder of this ordinance, but the effect thereof shall be confined to the section, paragraph,
subdivision, clause, sentence, or provision immediately involved in the controversy in which judgement or
decree shall be rendered.
6-3-3: REPEAL OF CONFLICTING ORDINANCES
A. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
6-3-4: PERMITS
A. No application for a building permit or other permit or license, or for a certificate of occupancy, shall be
approved by the Building Official, and no permit or license shall be issued by any other City department,
which would authorize the use or change in use of any land or building contrary to the provisions of this
Title, or the erection, moving, alteration, enlargement or occupancy of any building designed or intended to
be used for a purpose or in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Title.
6-3-5: BUILDING HEIGHT, BULK AND LOT COVERAGE
3 - 2
A. No building shall be erected, reconstructed, relocated or structurally altered so as to have a greater height or
bulk, a higher ratio of lot coverage, or smaller open space about it than is permissible under the limitations
set forth herein for the district in which such building is located.
B. No space allocated to a building or dwelling group for the purpose of complying with the side, rear or front
yard, or court or other open space or lot area requirements of this Title shall thereafter, by reason of change
in ownership or for any other reason, be used to satisfy the yard, court open space or lot area requirements
of any other building or dwelling group.
C. No usable open space or off-street parking space or loading space existing or provided hereafter for any
building shall be reduced below the minimum requirements hereinafter set forth, nor further reduced if
already less than said minimum requirements.
D. Streets Excluded. No part of any street easement or right-of-way, either public or private, shall be included
in determining the area of any lot.
E. Front Yards
1. More Restrictive Requirements. Whenever any ordinance or a covenant entered into by the City
stipulates a front yard or setback requirement along any street in any district which is greater than
the front yard requirement of the zoning district in which it is located, then the greater requirement
shall apply.
2. Adjacent Front Yard Requirements. Where two districts with different front yard requirements are
located adjacent to each other without a street or alley between them, the greater front yard
requirement shall extend into and be effective in the district having the lesser front yard
requirement for each contiguous lot with the same block along the frontage of a commonly shared
street.
3. Established Front Yard Setbacks. In the event fifty percent (50%) or more of the lots fronting on
one side of a street between two intersecting streets are improved with principal structures that
have setbacks greater in depth than required for such zoning district in this Title, the average of the
existing front yard setbacks of such structures upon all such improved lots between such streets
shall be the Established Front Yard Setback for such block. In such event, no new structure or any
addition to an existing structure shall be erected closer to the street than the Established Front
Yard Setback.
4. Corner Lots. Where lots have street frontage on more than one side, a front yard shall be provided
on each side adjacent to a street.
F. Rear Yards Adjacent to Alley. Whenever a lot abuts a public alley, one-half (1/2) of the width of that alley
may be considered as a portion of the required rear yard.
G. Intersection Visibility. Landscaping must be designed and installed to minimize potential obstruction of
critical sight lines. All landscape planting shall be so designed as to avoid obstruction of a motorist's vision
at the intersections of outlet access drives and ring roads, access roads, or municipal streets in accordance
with the following standards:
3 - 3
1. Unobstructed visibility between two (2') and six (6') feet above the height of the paved surface of
the access road must be maintained at all intersections. To maintain this visibility, no shrubs or
other landscape material which will reach a mature height greater than two (2') feet shall be
permitted within ten (10') feet of the edge of pavement of a primary thoroughfare, or five (5') feet
from the edge of pavement of a lesser roadway, for a distance of forty (40') feet from the edge of
pavement (see Illustration 3.1).
2. Trees are allowed in these intersection visibility areas if the lowest branching begins not less than
eight (8') feet above the pavement of the adjacent roadways.
6-3-6: PERMITTED OBSTRUCTIONS IN REQUIRED BUILDING SETBACK AREAS
A. Every part of a required yard setback area shall be open to the sky, unobstructed, except for the following:
1. An open terrace, but not including a roofed over porch or terrace, may occupy a front yard;
provided, the unoccupied portion of the front yard has a depth of not less than fifteen feet (15').
2. A one-story bay window may project into a front yard not more than three feet (3').
3. Overhanging eaves, sills, cornices, including gutters and ornamental features, may project over the
minimum required side yard not more than eighteen inches (18").
4. Open or lattice enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways, and balconies opening upon fire
towers projecting into a rear yard of not more than five (5) feet;
5. Steps and stoops not extending more than three (3') feet above grade and consisting only of the
minimum area necessary for a safe exit;
6. Terraces, and patios projecting into required yards, but not closer than two (2') feet to the adjacent
property line;
7. Ordinary projections of chimneys and flues into the rear yard;
8. Accessory buildings and uses as restricted elsewhere in this Title;
9. Driveways and parking spaces as restricted in this Title;
10. Freestanding yard lights in front yards, providing that in residential districts such lights do not exceed
seven (7') feet, six (6") inches, in height, nor shall such light be permitted to increase the
level of illumination at the side lot line more than one-half (1/2) foot candle;
11. Fences erected on lot lines and in required yards, providing such fences comply with Chapter 9 of
Title 7 of the City Code;
12. Any stone, paved or other surfaced patio or wooden deck constructed at or below a level which is
twelve inches (12") above grade, and which, except for property lying within an area for which a
planned residential permit has been issued under Chapter 12, does not lie within two feet (2') of
the property line closest to the point thereof.
13. Basketball backboards and/or hoops attached to any principal or accessory building in any singlefamily
residential district.
3 - 4
6-3-7: SPECIAL HEIGHT CONSIDERATIONS
A. The height requirements below further qualify the height requirements of this Title:
1. Height Exceptions. Chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, fire towers, ornamental towers
and spires, church steeples, or necessary mechanical appurtenances are all exempt from the height
requirements established in this Title. However, they may be subject to other ordinances of the
City of Dixon.
2. Antennae. Radio, radar, citizens band, and television receiving or transmitting antennae may be
erected on the roof of a main structure to a height not exceeding twelve (12') feet above the
highest point on the roof of said main structure, but not closer to any property line than twelve
(12') feet.
6-3-8: SPECIAL DENSITY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Density Fractions. When the calculation of the number of dwelling units permitted on a lot or parcel results
in a fraction the following rules shall apply:
1. When the density calculation results in a fraction, any fraction up to and including one-half (1/2 or
.5) shall be disregarded. Fractions of over one-half (1/2 or .5) shall be interpreted as permitting
the next highest whole number of dwelling units.
6-3-9: LOCATION OF BUILDINGS
A. Except as otherwise provided for in this Title, every building shall be constructed or erected upon a lot, or
parcel of land, which abuts upon a public street or permanent easement of access to a public street, which
easement shall have a minimum width of twenty-five feet (25'), unless an easement of lesser width was of
record prior to the adoption of this Title.
6-3-10: BUILDINGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A. Nothing in this Title shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of
any building upon which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this Title, or
amendment thereto, and upon which building construction has been diligently carried on; and provided
further, that such building shall be completed within one (1) year from the date of passage and publication
of this Title.
6-3-11: NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ON A ZONING LOT
A. Except in the case of planned unit developments, every residential building hereafter erected or structurally
altered shall be located on a zoning lot as herein defined, and in no case shall there be more than one (1)
such building on one (1) zoning lot.
3 - 5
3 - 6
6-3-12: ACCESSORY USES OUTSIDE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS

constructed building, nor shall any outdoor storage or storage inside a trailer be permitted, except as
provided below:
1. Outdoor accessory uses for the purpose of direct retail sales only, not for storage, and temporary
exterior storage may be permitted by the Building Official.
2. Permanent exterior storage or display of inventory, business vehicles or personal vehicles is
prohibited without the issuance of a permit approved by the City Council.

PART A: NONCONFORMING USES
641:
CONTINUANCE OF USE
A. Any lawfully established use of a building or land, at the effective date of this Title or of amendments
thereto that does not conform to the use regulations for the zoning district in which it is located shall be
deemed to be a legal nonconforming use and may be continued, except as otherwise provided herein.
B. Except as otherwise permitted herein, any legal nonconforming building or structure may be continued
in use provided there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair, except as

amendments thereto, may be completed in accordance with the approved plans; provided, construction is
4 2
started within six (6) months and diligently prosecuted to completion. The building shall thereafter be
deemed a legal nonconforming use.
642:
DISCONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES
A. Whenever any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a nonconforming use is changed to or
replaced by a use conforming to the provisions of this Title, such premises shall not thereafter be used or
occupied by any nonconforming use.
B. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or structure, or part thereof, has been discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) consecutive months, or for a period of twenty four (24) consecutive months if the
building was originally designed and constructed for a nonresidential use, or whenever there is evident a
clear intent on the part of the owner to abandon a nonconforming use, such use shall not after being
discontinued or abandoned be reestablished, and the use of the premises thereafter shall conform with
the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
C. Except as provided in Chapter 13, Part J, where no enclosed building is involved, discontinuance of a
nonconforming use for a period of six (6) consecutive months shall constitute abandonment.
D. A nonconforming use not authorized by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time the
original Zoning Ordinance or any amendments thereto became effective shall be discontinued and not
reestablished.
643:
CHANGE OF USE
A. A nonconforming use of a building or structure, or part thereof, may be changed to a use of the same or
of a more restricted character, but may not thereafter be changed to any less restricted use, except as
provided in Chapter 13, Part J.
B. Except as provided in Chapter 13, Part J, any part of a building, structure or land occupied by a

644:
REPAIR OR ALTERATION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Normal maintenance of a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use is permitted,
including necessary nonstructural repairs and incidental alterations.

except in the following situations:
1. When the alteration is required by law.
4 3
2. When the alteration will actually result in eliminating the nonconformity.
3. A building containing a residential nonconforming use may be altered in any way to improve
livability; provided no structural alteration shall be made which would increase the number of
dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
4. Except as provided in Chapter 13, Part J, no nonconforming use may be enlarged or extended in such a
way as to occupy any required usable open space, or any land beyond the boundaries of the zoning lot
as it existed at the effective date of this Title, or any amendments thereto, or to displace any conforming
use in the same building, or on the same building, or on the same parcel. Any nonconforming use,
however, may be expanded or enlarged within the boundaries of its zoning lot so long as such expansion
or enlargement does not occupy any required usable open space on the lot.
C. Any structure constructed in conformance with the bulk and setback regulations in effect prior to the
effective date of this Title shall not become nonconforming as a result of the application of the new bulk
and setback regulations in this Title. However, except as provided in Section 649,
any addition or
enlargement to a nonconforming structure must be made in conformance with the bulk and setback
regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
645:
DAMAGE AND DESTRUCTION OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. If a nonconforming building or other structure is partially or totally damaged or destroyed by any means
the building or other structure may be reconstructed or restored in the same location in which the
building or other structure existed prior to the total or partial destruction. The occupancy or use of the
building which existed at the time of total or partial destruction may be continued in accordance with the
regulations of this Chapter 4.
1. Replacement, alteration or repair of the building or other structure must be started within a
period of one (1) year of the event and diligently prosecuted to completion. Failure to initiate
or conclude restoration within these limits shall constitute abandonment as defined in Section

646:
DEVELOPMENT PROHIBITED
A. Except as provided in Chapter 13, Part J, and in Section 647.1

3. Over fifty percent (50%) of the lots within 500 feet of the lot in question have been developed as
individual building sites, containing one principal building or structure each, which do not meet
the lot width or lot area requirement for the zoning district in which they are located; and the
owners of abutting lots refuse to sell or convey portions of those lots that could be added to the lot
in order to make it meet the area and width requirements without reducing the lot area, lot width,
and yards required by this Title for any such abutting lot. (Ord. 2094, 61598)
647.1:
EXCEPTION
A. It shall not be necessary to obtain a variation from the restrictions contained in Section 646
if a property
owner can demonstrate to the Building Inspector that the following standards have been met:

nonconforming use shall be completely removed from the premises at the expiration of the two (2) year
period.
1. Any nonconforming building or structure having an assessed valuation not in excess of One
Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) on the effective date of this Title.

connection with a conforming building.
4 5
PART E: EXEMPTIONS
649:
EXEMPTIONS
A. Wherever a lawfully existing building, use or other structure otherwise conforms to the use regulations
of this Title, but is nonconforming only in the particular manner specified below, the building, and use
thereof shall be exempt from the requirements of Section 645.
1. In any residential district, where a dwelling is nonconforming only as to the number of dwelling
units it contains; provided, no such building shall be altered in any way so as to increase the
number of dwelling units therein.

SHORT TITLE
This Chapter shall hereafter be known and cited as the Sign Regulations.
662:
PURPOSE OF SIGN REGULATIONS
This Chapter of the Zoning Ordinance is established to create the standards for a comprehensive and balanced
system of sign regulations for the following purposes:
6 2
A. To encourage, as a means of communication in the City of Dixon, the employment of signs which are:
1. Compatible with their surroundings.
2. Appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain.
3. Expressive of the identity of individual proprietors.
4. Legible in the circumstances in which they are seen.
5. Respectful of the reasonable rights of other sign owners and property owners.
B. To preserve, protect and promote the public health, safety, morals and welfare.
C. To improve pedestrian and traffic safety.
D. To maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City’s ability to attract sources of economic
development by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs.
E. To minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property.
F. To preserve the value of private property by assuring the compatibility of signs with surrounding land
uses.
G. To ensure that signs are designed as integral architectural elements of the building and site to which they
principally relate.
663:
SCOPE
No sign shall be constructed, erected, initially painted, converted, altered, rebuilt, enlarged, remodeled, relocated
or expanded until a permit for such sign has been obtained in accordance with the standards and procedures set out
in this Chapter. However, no permit shall be required for routine maintenance as defined herein.
664:
PERMITS REQUIRED
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, repair, alter, relocate or maintain within the City any sign or other
advertising structure, as defined in Chapter 2, without first obtaining a sign permit from the Building Official and
making payment of the fee required by Section 668.
All illuminated signs shall, in addition, be subject to the
provisions of the Electrical Code. No permit shall be required for routine maintenance of a sign.
665:
APPLICATION FOR SIGN PERMIT
Application for sign permits shall be made upon a form provided by the Building Official, and shall contain or
have attached thereto the following information:
A. Name, address and telephone number of the applicant.
B. Location of building, structure, or lot to which or upon which the sign or other advertising structure is to
be attached or erected.
C. Position of the sign or other advertising in relation to nearby buildings or structures.
6 3
D. One blueprint or ink drawing of the plans and specifications and method of construction and attachment
to the building or in the ground.
E. Copy of stress sheets and calculations showing the structure is designed for dead load and wind pressure
in any direction in the amount required by this and all other laws and ordinances of the City.
F. Name of person, firm, corporation or association erecting structure.
G. Written consent of the owner of the building, structure or land to which or on which the structure is to be
erected.
H. Insurance policy or bond as required by Sections 6617
and 6618.
I. Such other information as the Building Official shall require to show full compliance with this and all
other laws and ordinances of the City. The above information may be waived by the Building Official
where not applicable due to site or other conditions.
666:
ILLUMINATED SIGNS
The application for a permit for erection of a sign or other advertising structure in which electrical wiring and
connections are to be used, shall provide adequate plans and specifications respecting all wiring and connections to
determine if the same complies with the Electrical Code of the City. The Building Official shall approve said
application and issue a permit only if the plans and specifications comply with said Electrical Code.
667:
PERMIT ISSUED IF APPLICATION IN ORDER
It shall be the duty of the Building Official, upon the filing of an application for a sign permit, to examine such
plans and specifications and other data and the premises upon which it is proposed to erect the sign or other
advertising structure, and if it shall appear that the proposed structure is in compliance with all the requirements of
this Chapter and all other laws and ordinances of the City, he shall then issue the sign permit. If the work
authorized under a sign permit has not been completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after date of issuance,
the said permit shall become null and void. If work authorized by said permit is suspended or abandoned for six
(6) months at any time after the work has commenced, a new permit shall be first obtained prior to recommencing
work and the fee shall be the amount required for a new permit for such work.
668:
PERMIT FEE
Every applicant, before being granted a permit hereunder shall pay the following permit fee for each such sign or
other advertising structure, regulated by this Chapter.
A. Fifty cents ($.50) per square foot for the first fifty (50) square feet of sign area.
B. Twenty five cents ($.25) per square foot for each square foot of sign area thereafter.
C. A minimum permit fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be paid if the sign has an area less than ten (10) square
feet.
D. Fees charged for permits issued and appeals shall be as established and may be, from time to time,
amended by the City Council.
6 4
Persons guilty of erecting or maintaining a sign without first securing the necessary permit shall be subject to a
penalty fee of fifty percent (50%) of the normal fee amount in addition to the obligation to pay the normal fee in
addition to any other remedies the City may have under the City Code.
669:
DENIAL OF SIGN PERMIT
A. If an application for a sign permit is denied by the Building Official, he shall give written notice of the
denial to the applicant, together with a written statement of the reason for the denial. The Building

The off-street parking and loading requirements of this Title shall apply as follows:
A. All buildings and structures erected and land uses initiated after the effective date of this Title shall provide
accessory off-street parking or loading facilities as required hereinafter for the use thereof, except that a
building or structure for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Title
shall not be required to furnish parking or loading facilities if construction is begun thereon within six (6)
months of the effective date of this Title and diligently prosecuted to completion.
7 - 2
B. When a building or structure erected prior to or after the effective date of this Title shall undergo a decrease
in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees, or other unit of measurement
specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities, and further when the decrease
would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces through application of the
provisions of this Title thereto, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly; provided, that
existing parking or loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the facilities remaining would at least
equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements resulting from application of the provisions of this
Title to the entire building or structure as modified.
6-7-4: EXISTING PARKING AND LOADING SPACES
Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces in existence on the effective date of this Title may not be reduced in
number unless already exceeding the requirements of this Chapter for equivalent new construction, in which event
the spaces shall not be reduced below the number required herein for such equivalent new construction.
6-7-5: PERMISSIVE PARKING AND LOADING SPACES
Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent the establishment of off-street automobile parking or loading facilities to serve
any existing use of land or buildings, subject to full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter, except that offstreet
parking areas accessory to existing multiple-family structures cannot be located off the premises containing
the main use, unless on a lot adjacent thereto, without authorization by the City Council.
6-7-6: DAMAGE, DESTRUCTION, REMODELING OR REBUILDING
Any building, structure, or use which is in existence and is a conforming use on the effective date of this Title and
which subsequently shall be damaged or destroyed by fire, collapse, explosion or other cause or which shall be razed
and remodeled or rebuilt, may be constructed, reconstructed, rebuilt, reestablished or repaired with or without offstreet
parking or loading facilities, except that parking or loading facilities equivalent to any maintained at the time
of such damage, destruction or razing shall be restored or continued in operation, provided that the number of
dwelling units, number of employees, or number of loading spaces remains the same.
6-7-7: SCHEDULE OF REQUIREMENTS
A. Tables for Required Parking and Loading: Requirements governing the number and location of off-street
parking and off-street loading facilities in relation to the use of property are established within this chapter.
The parking and loading requirements for any use not specified therein shall be the same as for a similar
specific use.
B. Reduction of Required Parking Spaces: The City Council may, by variance, reduce the total number of offstreet
parking spaces required for business and professional uses.
C. Captive Market. Parking requirements for retail and restaurant uses may be reduced permanently where it
can be determined that some portion of the patronage of these businesses comes from other uses (i.e.,
employees of area offices patronizing restaurants) located within a maximum walking distance of one
thousand (1,000') feet.
7 - 3
1. Central Business District. In lieu of an independent parking study, the following factors for
captive market adjustments may be employed for uses in the Central Business District.
Retail/Service - 15% Reduction
Food and Beverage - 15% Reduction
General Offices - 5% Reduction
Financial Institutions - 5% Reduction
6-7-8: RESIDENTIAL PARKING FACILITIES
Off-street parking facilities accessory to residential use and developed in any residential district in accordance with
the requirements of this Chapter shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles owned by occupants
of the dwelling structures to which such facilities are accessory or by guests of the occupants. Under no
circumstances shall required parking facilities accessory to residential structures be used for the storage of
commercial vehicles, or for the parking of automobiles belonging to the employees, owners, tenants, visitors, or
customers of business or manufacturing establishments, except as permitted in Section 6-7-12.
6-7-9: JOINT AND SHARED PARKING FACILITIES
Joint Parking: Off-street parking facilities for different buildings, structures or uses, or for mixed uses, may be
provided collectively in any zoning district in which separate parking facilities for each constituent use would be
permitted; provided, that the total number of spaces so located together shall not be less than the sum of the separate
requirements for each use if the peak requirements of the uses in question overlap.
Shared Parking. Cumulative parking requirements for mixed-use occupancies may be reduced where it can be
determined that the peak requirement of the several occupancies occurs at different times (either daily or
seasonally). The Shared Parking report published by the Urban Land Institute may be used as a guideline in the
estimation of parking demand. The process for approval and the use of land gained through Shared Parking shall
conform to the land banking process in Section 6-7-7-B.
6-7-10: CONTROL OF OFF-SITE FACILITIES
When required accessory off-street parking facilities are provided elsewhere than on the lot on which the principal
use served is located, they shall be in the same possession, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property
occupied by the principal use, and the owner shall be bound by covenants filed on record in the office of the
Recorder of Deeds or the Registrar of Titles of Lee County, requiring the owner and his heirs and assigns to
maintain the required number of parking spaces during the existence of the principal use.
6-7-11: PERMITTED DISTRICTS FOR ACCESSORY PARKING

of the City Code.
E. An accessory parking facility in a B-1 or B-2 District may only be used to park motor vehicles on a
temporary basis not to exceed five (5) consecutive days. (Ord. 09-10-2007)
6-7-12: NONRESIDENTIAL PARKING IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS
Accessory off-street parking facilities serving nonresidential uses of property may be permitted in an R-3 District
when authorized by the City Council, subject to the following requirements in addition to all other relevant
requirements of this Section.
A. The parking lot shall be accessory to, and for use in connection with, one (1) or more nonresidential
establishments located in adjoining districts, or in connection with one (1) or more existing professional or
institutional office buildings or institutions.
B. The parking lot shall be used solely for the parking of passenger automobiles.

until 12:00 midnight.
F. Each entrance to and exit from the parking lot shall be at least twenty feet (20') distant from any adjacent
property located in any residential district, except where ingress and egress to the parking lot is provided
from a public alley or public way separating the residential areas from the proposed parking lot.
G. In addition to the foregoing requirements, such parking lots shall conform to any further requirements and
conditions as may be prescribed by the City Council for the protection of properties adjacent to and in the
vicinity of the proposed parking lot.
6-7-13: DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE
A. Parking Space; Description: A required off-street parking space shall be not less than eight and a half feet
(8 1/2') wide by nineteen feet (19') long, exclusive of access drives or aisles, ramps, columns, or office and
work areas, accessible from streets or alleys or from private driveways or aisles leading to streets or alleys
and to be used for the storage or parking of passenger automobiles or commercial vehicles under one and
one-half (1 1/2) ton capacity. The nineteen foot (19') length may include up to two feet (2') of abutting
space in a vegetative buffer or landscaped area over which a parked vehicle may extend, provided that no
parked vehicle may project over a sidewalk or other pedestrian walkway. Aisles between vehicular parking
spaces shall be at least the width designated in Figure 7.1, based on the angle of the parking stalls provided
and whether the aisle serves one or two rows of parking spaces.
B. Measurement of Space: When determination of the number of required off-street parking spaces results in a
requirement of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded, and
fractions over one-half (1/2) shall be interpreted as one (1) parking space.
7 - 5
C. Access: Parking facilities shall be designed with appropriate means of vehicular access to a street or alley

shall be located within a required front yard. No parking spaces nor portion thereof established on a zoning
lot without a building shall be located closer to any street line than the established building line on adjacent
properties nor closer than the front yard setback required for the district in which the parking lot is located.
F. Surfacing: All open off-street parking areas and driveways shall be improved with a compacted base, not
less than six inches (6”) thick, surfaced with asphaltic concrete or some comparable all-weather dustless
material.1

convalescent homes, dormitories, sorority and fraternity houses, and for other similar uses, the off-street
parking facilities required shall be on the same lot or parcel of land as the main building being served, or
upon properties contiguous to the zoning lot upon which is located the building they are intended to serve.
E. For uses other than those specified herein, off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot or
parcel of land as the main building being served, or on a separate lot or parcel of land not over one
thousand feet (1000') from the entrance of the main building, measured from the nearest point of the

12 3
1. A Planned Unit Development shall be governed by the regulations of the district in which the
development is proposed, except as provided in this Chapter and modified by and authorized in
the ordinance approving the Planned Unit Development. Said ordinance may provide for such
exceptions from the applicable district regulations governing setbacks, lot width, lot area and
other requirements as may be desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed Planned Unit
Development, provided such exceptions are consistent with the standards and criteria contained
in this Chapter.
2. Modifications in conventional zoning and subdivision regulations are privileges and will be
considered by the City Council only in direct response to the accrual of tangible benefits from the
Planned Unit Development to the City or the neighborhood in which it would be located. These
benefits shall be in the form of exceptional amenities; outstanding environmental, landscape,
architectural or site design; or the conservation of special manmade
or natural features of the

Chapter 6 of this Title.
J. Residential Planned Unit Development Standards
1. Determination of Permitted Density:
Except for developments which qualified for increased density based on incentives under Section
6122
J. 7 of this Chapter, the total number of dwelling units to be constructed in a planned unit
development shall not exceed the number that could be developed on the same acreage if
developed as a standard subdivision in the zoning district in which it is located.
a. One of the following techniques shall be used to determine the total number of dwelling
units allowed in a planned unit development:

If the proposed Planned Unit Development is in more than one zoning district, the number of
allowable dwelling units and maximum lot coverage by building must be separately calculated for
each portion of the planned development that is in a separate zone, and must then be combined to
determine the number of dwelling units allowable in the entire planned development. However,
the distribution of dwelling units and lot sizes within the planned development is not to be
affected by existing zoning district boundaries.
5. Perimeter Setback Requirements:
12 5
Structures located on the perimeter of the development shall comply with the minimum front,
side or rear yard setbacks, whichever are applicable, of the zoning district in which the

approved by the Planning Commission which restrict the common
open space to the uses specified on the final development plan, and
which provide for the maintenance of the common open space in a
manner which assures its continuing use for its intended purpose.
(2) No common open space may be put to any use not specified in the final
development plan unless the final development plan has been amended to
permit that use as provided herein. However, no change of use authorized
under amendments of the plan may be considered as a waiver of any of the
covenants limiting the use of common open space areas. All rights to enforce
these covenants against any use permitted under further amendment of the plan
are expressly reserved.
(3) If the common open space is not conveyed to a public agency, either one of the
following methods of enforcement must be provided:

PART C: SPECIAL USES
61312:
PURPOSE
The principle objective of this Title is to provide for an orderly arrangement of compatible building and land uses,
and for the proper location of all types of uses required for the social and economic welfare of the City. To
accomplish this objective, each type and kind of use is classified as permitted in one or more of the various districts
established by this Title. However, in addition to those uses specifically classified and permitted in each district,
there are certain additional uses which it may be necessary to allow because of their unusual characteristics or the
service they provide the public. These "special uses" require particular consideration as to their proper location in
relation to adjacent established or intended uses, or to the planned development of the community. The conditions
controlling the location and operation of the "special uses" are established by this Part C and Part B of Chapter 13,
and Chapter 14.
61313:
PROCEDURES
13 10
For purposes of this Chapter 13, a petition for approval of a special use shall follow the same procedures as
required for a text amendment or zoning district change as outlined in Part E of this Chapter 13.
61314:
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF SPECIAL USES
A. General Standards: A special use permit shall be granted only if the Plan Commission finds the
application has demonstrated that the proposed use complies with the following general standards:
1. Each special use should be presented and judged on its own merits. It shall not be sufficient to
base justification for approval upon an already existing special use.
2. The proposed use is consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
3. The establishment, maintenance or operation of the proposed use will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the residents of the City.
4. The proposed use will not diminish the use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity for
those uses which are permitted by the Zoning Ordinance of the City.
5. Adequate measures already exist or will be taken to provide ingress and egress to the proposed
use in a manner that minimizes traffic congestion.
6. The proposed use will be designed and located in a manner that is consistent with the character
of neighboring properties and/or the City as a whole.
7. The proposed use will not adversely affect a known historical or cultural resource.
8. The proposed use has made adequate provisions for buffers, landscaping, fencing, lighting,
building materials, public open space and other improvements necessary to insure that the
proposed use does not adversely impact adjacent uses and is compatible with the surrounding
area and/or City as a whole.
9. The design and location of the proposed use promotes a safe and comfortable pedestrian
environment.
10. The offsite
impacts of the proposed use, such as traffic, noise, hours of operation and visual
impacts, have been shown to be compatible with the surrounding area.
11. The proposed use will comply with the requirements of the City of Dixon Subdivision Ordinance.
61315:
SPECIAL USE CONDITIONS
A. General Conditions: After reviewing an application for a special use permit and considering the unique
features of the specific special use proposal, the Plan Commission may recommend, and the City Council
may require, such additional conditions upon the construction, location and operation of the special use as
shall be deemed necessary to insure that the special use will meet the standards for special uses set forth in
Part C and B of this Chapter 13 and the landscaping and tree preservation regulations of Chapter 14.
B. Booklet of Typical Conditions:
13 11
1. The Building Official shall cause to be prepared, as an administrative document, a booklet
containing a list of conditions typically associated with each special use permitted by this
Chapter. Said booklet shall be periodically reviewed jointly by the Plan Commission and the
Building Official for the purpose of updating and modifying the booklet. A copy of the booklet
setting forth the appropriate list of conditions shall be available to each applicant for a special use
and to members of the general public.
2. The booklet of typical conditions shall serve as a guideline for the conditions, if any, ultimately
recommended by the Plan Commission to the City Council in conjunction with a recommended
special use permit. The Plan Commission may include those conditions specified in the booklet
that it feels are appropriate to the specific application for a special use permit or may supplement
other appropriate conditions.
61316:
EFFECT OF APPROVAL OR DENIAL
A. Approval of the application by the City Council authorizes the applicant to proceed with any necessary
applications for building permits, certificates of occupancy, and other permits which the City may require
for the proposed development. The Building Official shall review applications for these permits for
compliance with the terms of the special use approval granted by the City Council. No permit shall be
issued for work which does not comply with the terms of the special use approval.
B. No application for a special use shall be filed with or accepted by the Building Official which is identical
or substantially similar to an application which has been denied by the City Council within the previous
twelve (12) months.
C. Each special use which is approved by the City Council either shall attach to the property itself and run
with the land, or shall lapse when the person who received approval of the special use ceases to conduct
the activity for which the special use approval was granted. All special use approvals shall be considered
personal to the applicant and shall lapse when the person who received the approval ceases to conduct the
special use, unless the ordinance which approves the special use provides that the special use approval
shall run with the land.
D. Any discontinuation of an approved special use for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days
shall constitute abandonment and shall rescind the approval of the special use.

reported, shall not be passed by the City Council except by the favorable vote of twothirds
(2/3) of all the elected
members of the City Council. 3
61330:
EFFECT OF DENIAL
No application for an amendment shall be filed with or accepted by the Building Official which is proposed by
someone other than the City Council, Plan Commission, or Zoning Board of Appeals, and which is identical or
substantially similar to a proposed amendment which has been rejected by the City Council within the previous
twelve (12) months.
PART F: SIGN PERMITS
61331:
APPLICABILITY AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES
It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, repair, alter, relocate or maintain within the City any sign or other
advertising structure as defined in Chapter 6, without first obtaining a sign permit from the Building Official, and
complying with the application and review procedures of Chapter 6.
PART G: BUILDING PERMITS
61332:
ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMIT
A. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected or structurally altered until a building permit shall be
issued by the Building Inspector stating that the building or structure, and use of land, comply with the
regulations of this Title and all building and health regulations of this Code.
B. All applications for building permits shall be accompanied by a plat in duplicate drawn to scale showing
the actual dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the size of the building or structure to be erected or
structurally altered, and its location as may be necessary to provide for the enforcement of these
regulations. A careful record of such applications and plats shall be kept in the office of the Building
Official.
PART H: CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE
61333:
CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE
A. No building or structure hereafter erected or structurally altered shall be occupied and used until a
certificate of compliance has been issued by the Building Inspector. The certificate of compliance shall be
3 997
13 19
issued only after the Building Inspector makes a finding that the building or structure has been erected or
structurally altered in conformance with the provisions of this Title and other health and building
regulations of this Code and in accordance with a building permit.
B. Certificates of compliance shall be applied for coincident with the application for a building permit and
shall be issued within ten (10) days after the erection and alterations of such building shall have been
satisfactorily completed. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office of the Building
Inspector and copies shall be furnished, on request, to any person having a proprietary interest in the
building affected.
PART I: ZONING PERMITS
61334:
ZONING PERMITS
No change shall be made in the use of a building or part thereof now or hereafter erected or structurally altered, or
in the use of land now or hereafter occupied, without a zoning permit having first been issued by the Building
Inspector. No such use permit shall be issued to make such change unless it is in conformity with the provisions of
this Title and amendments thereto hereafter duly enacted.
PART J: VARIATIONS
61335:
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The "variation" process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this Title in those cases
where strict application of those requirements will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting
the use of land in a manner otherwise allowed under this Title. It is not intended that variations be granted merely
to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this Title may impose on property owners
in general. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this Title render the land difficult to
use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the property for
which the variation is requested. In no event, however, shall the City grant a variation which would allow the
establishment of a use which is not otherwise allowed in a zoning district or which would change the zoning
district classification of any or all of the affected property.
61336:
FILING OF PETITIONS; DETERMINATION OF COMPLETENESS
A. An application for a variation may be filed only by the owner of the land affected by the variation, an
agent, lessee, or contract purchaser specifically authorized by the owner to file such application, or any
unit of government which is not the owner of the lot but proposes to acquire the lot by purchase, gift, or
condemnation. Where an agent, lessee, or contract purchaser files the application, the agent, lessee, or
contract purchaser shall provide the City with written documentation that the owner of the property has
authorized the filing of the application.
B. An application for a variation shall be filed with the Building Official. The application shall include a
written statement by the applicant and adequate evidence showing that the proposed variation will
conform to the standards set forth in this Part. The application shall be accompanied by such plans, data,
or both as specified in the rules of the Zoning Board of Appeals. If the proposed variation will
accommodate the construction, demolition, or external modification of any structure then the application
must be accompanied by a site plan showing the proposed work and other site features relevant to review
of the proposed work.
C. If the Building Official determines that the application is not complete, then he or she shall notify the
applicant of any deficiencies and shall take no further steps to process the application until the
13 20
deficiencies are remedied. Once the application is complete, the Building Official shall schedule the
application for consideration at a public hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
61337:
STAFF REVIEW
Prior to the scheduled public hearing, the Building Official shall deliver to the Zoning Board of Appeals copies of
the complete application and a written report summarizing the facts of the case, including all relevant documents
and staff comments. The Building Official shall also send a copy of the written report to the applicant prior to the
scheduled public hearing.
61338:
ACTION BY ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
A. Upon receiving the application and report from the Building Official, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
hold at least one public hearing on the proposed variation. Notice of the public hearing shall be provided
and the public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Part A of this Chapter.
B. In considering the application, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall review the application, the general
purpose and standards set forth in Section 61339
for the granting of variations, the report of the
Building Official, and any oral and written comments received by the Zoning Board of Appeals before or
at the public hearing.
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not recommend the granting of any variation unless there is a
concurring vote of a majority of all members present, with a minimum of four concurring votes required,
based on findings of fact that the proposed variation meets the standards set forth in this Part for the
proposed variation.
D. Within a reasonable time, all findings of fact the Zoning Board of Appeals arrived at shall be submitted
with a report and recommendation to the City Council. The recommendation of the Zoning Board of
Appeals may specify such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be
necessary to satisfy the standards set forth in Section 61339
and to reduce or minimize any injurious
effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood.
61339:
STANDARDS OF REVIEW
A. A variation shall be granted only where the evidence presented in the particular case shows that:
1. The particular physical conditions, shape, or surroundings of the property would impose upon the
owner a practical difficulty or particular hardship, as opposed to a mere inconvenience, if the
requirements of this Chapter were strictly enforced; and
2. The plight of the property owner was not created by the owner and is due to unique
circumstances; and
3. The difficulty or hardship is peculiar to the property in question and is not generally shared by
other properties classified in the same zoning district and/or used for the same purposes; and
4. The difficulty or hardship resulting from the application of this Title would prevent the owner
from making a reasonable use of the property; however, the fact that the property could be
utilized more profitably with the variation than without the variation shall not be considered as
grounds for granting the variation; and
13 21
5. The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or
otherwise injure other property or its use, will not substantially increase the danger of fire or
otherwise endanger the public health, safety, morals and welfare, and will not substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; and
6. The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will be
consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies set forth in the Comprehensive Plan.
7. The variation will not unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets.
B. In the case of variations sought from the regulations of Chapter 4 “Nonconforming Buildings, Structures
and Uses,” the following standards shall be considered by the Zoning Board of Appeals in lieu of those
standards provided in Section 61339
A.:
1. Whether a strict application of the terms of Chapter 4 imposes on the Applicant a practical
difficulty or particular hardship that can be alleviated by the granting of a variance under this
Part J of Chapter 13; and
2. Whether the granting of the variance will be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
and
3. Whether the granting of the variance will be beneficial to the public welfare of the City as a
whole; and
4. Whether the granting of the variance will adversely impact the use or structure on abutting
properties and, if so, whether the Applicant is proposing to provide a landscaped or other
appropriate buffer to reduce those adverse impacts; and
5. Whether the granting of the variance will either increase the number of employees hired by the
Applicant or allow the Applicant to maintain a profitable business within the City; and
6. Whether the nonconforming use and/or structure has existed for more than five years; and
7. Whether the Applicant has been offered significant financial incentives by the City and/or
County to relocate his or her nonconforming use and/or structure within the City and/or County.
61340:
JURISDICTION
A. When a property owner or his agent shows that a strict application of the terms of the Zoning Title
relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land imposes upon
him practical difficulties or particular hardship, then the Zoning Board of Appeals may grant such
variations of the strict application of the terms of the Zoning Title as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent when the Board is satisfied, under the evidence heard before it, that a granting of such
variation will not merely serve as a convenience to the applicant, but is necessary to alleviate some
demonstrable hardship or difficulty so great as to warrant a variation from the provisions of the Zoning
Title, or in the following instances:
1. To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a zoning district divides a lot in
single ownership as shown on record prior to the date of passage of the Zoning Title.
13 22
2. To permit a front yard, a side yard, or a rear yard less than that required by the Zoning Title, but
such variation shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the depth of the front yard, or the depth of
the rear yard, or the width of a side yard as required by the Zoning Title.
3. To permit a building to exceed the height limit by not more than ten percent (10%) of the height
limit established by the zoning district in which it is located.
4. To permit the use of a lot less in area than that required by the zoning district in which it is
located by not more than twenty percent (20%).
5. To permit the use of a lot less in width than that required by the zoning district in which it is
located by not more than twenty percent (20%).
6. To interpret the provisions of the Zoning Title where the street layout actually on the ground
varies from the street layout as shown on the Official Zoning Map fixing the several districts,
which Map is made a part of the Zoning Title.
61341:
ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL; CONDITIONS
A. No variation in any specific case shall be made by the City Council without a hearing by the Zoning Board
of Appeals as required herein nor without a report thereof having been made by the Board to the City
Council, and every such report shall be accompanied by findings of fact specifying the reasons for the
report.
B. Upon receiving the report and recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, and without further
public hearing, the City Council may:
1. deny the variation; or
2. refer the application back to the Zoning Board of Appeals for further consideration; or
3. adopt an ordinance granting the variation.
C. The City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of a variation as it deems necessary to have
the proposed use meet the standards set forth in Section 61339
above and to prevent or minimize adverse
effects on other property in the neighborhood. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to:
limitations on size, bulk and location; requirements for landscaping, signage, outdoor lighting, and the
provision of adequate ingress and egress; limitations on hours of operation; and the mitigation of
environmental impacts. Such conditions may be stricter than any requirement or limitation stated
elsewhere in this Title for the proposed use.
D. Any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval of four (4) members of the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of twothirds
(2/3) of all the elected members of
the City Council; however, the City Council may approve the variation by only a majority vote of those
members present and voting where the application is filed by the City itself or by a public school district,
public library district, or public park district governed by a board or commission elected by the residents
of the City. Any variation which receives the approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals may nevertheless
be denied by a majority vote of the members of the City Council present and voting. 4
61342:
EFFECT OF APPROVAL OR DENIAL
4 997
13 23
A. The granting of a variation by the City Council authorizes the applicant to proceed with any necessary
applications for building permits, certificates of occupancy, and other permits which the City may require
for any proposed development of the property. The Building Official shall review applications for these
permits for compliance with the terms of variation granted by the City Council. No permit shall be issued
for work which does not comply with the terms of the variation.
B. The approval of a variation by the City Council shall be void if the recipient does not file an application
for a building permit or certificate of occupancy for the proposed use within six (6) months after the date
of the ordinance granting the variation. An applicant who has obtained a variation may request an
extension of this time period by filing with the Building Official a letter stating the reasons for the
request. The Building Official shall transmit the letter to the City Council which at a regular meeting
may grant the request for good cause shown by the applicant.
C. No application for a variation shall be filed with or accepted by the Building Official which is identical or
substantially similar to an application which has been denied by the City Council within the previous
twelve (12) months.
61343:
CHANGE OF ZONING
A. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to give or grant to the Zoning Board of Appeals the power or
authority to alter or change the Zoning Title or any zoning district made a part of the Zoning Map, such
power and authority being reserved to the City Council. The Zoning Board shall not have any power or
authority with respect to any alterations or change of the Zoning Title except to make recommendations to
the City Council in such specific cases as may properly come before the Board.
PART K: ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS
61344:
APPEALS AND REVIEW
A. Any person aggrieved by a ruling of the Building Official or by any officer, department, board or bureau
of the City concerning the interpretation of this Title, may take an appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
B. The appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the Zoning Board of Appeals by
general rules adopted by it, and shall be taken by filing with the Clerk and with the Zoning Board of
Appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, together with such plats and exhibits as are
reasonably necessary. The appeal shall be taken upon forms provided by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
The Clerk shall forthwith transmit to the Board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed was taken.
61345:
STAY OF PROCEEDINGS
A. The appeal shall stay all proceedings and furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Building
Official certifies to the Zoning Board of Appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed with him or her that
by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his or her opinion cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which
may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by a court of record on application, with notice to the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and all due causes shown.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing of appeals and shall
give notice thereof to the persons appealing and to the officer from whom the appeal is taken. It shall
hear and decide the appeal within a reasonable time. At the hearing parties of interest may appear in
person, by agent or attorney.
13 24
C. The Zoning Board of Appeals may reverse or affirm wholly or in part, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in the premises and to that end
shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
D. All final administrative decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals under this Chapter shall be subject to
judicial review pursuant to the provisions of the "Administrative Review Act" of the State, approved May
8, 1945, and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. The term
"administrative decision" is defined as in section 1 of the "Administrative Review Act." (735 ILCS 5/3101)

conditions or other circumstances beyond the developer's control prevent installation of all or portions of
the landscape materials.
6-14-4: LANDSCAPE IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
1 601
14 - 5
The following shall establish standards for the landscape improvements required to be installed as part of the
development of new buildings, structures and uses of land governed by Chapter 13, Part B "Site Plan Review"
unless a waiver from any or all of the conditions is approved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Part J of Chapter
13 or as set forth below.1
A. Minimum Landscaped Open Space: Except as may be otherwise permitted pursuant to paragraph B below,
for all sites a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of total land area of the parcel shall be devoted to
landscaped open space.
B. Flexibility in the Administration of Required Landscape Standards: To meet the objectives of this Section,
the following landscape requirements are hereby established. These standards provide specific
requirements for site landscaping. However, the City recognizes that, because of the wide variety of types
of developments and the relationships between them, it is neither possible nor prudent to establish
inflexible landscape requirements. Therefore, the City may permit less intensive landscaping or flexible
landscape design if approval for such changes is made pursuant to Section 6-14-2 or whenever such
changes are (i) appropriate under this particular circumstances, and (ii) do not constitute a change of more
than 33% from the requirements set forth in subsection A above, and (iii) have been approved by a majority
vote of a committee consisting of the Building Official, the Plan Commission Chairman and a duly
appointed member of the City Council.

1. Application for such permit shall be made to the Zoning Administration created hereunder.
2. Each application shall include the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient
particularity to permit a determination of whether the structure will conform to the regulations
herein prescribed.
C. Exceptions: Where an emergency installation, repair or replacement is required to be made by any public

from the standpoint of health, safety, or general welfare does not permit sufficient time to obtain such
permit, then in that event the requirement shall not apply, but a report shall be given as hereinafter set
forth in Subsection D of this Section.
D. Reports:
1. Whenever a new structure is erected or the height of an existing structure is increased in any of
the zones hereby created except the horizontal surface zone, and the proposed height of such
structure does not require a permit as herein set forth, a written report shall be given to the
Zoning Administration within ten (10) days after the completion of such alteration or erection,
setting forth the facts relating thereto with sufficient particularity to permit a determination as to
whether such structure conforms to the regulations prescribed herein.
2. In Horizontal Surface Zone: Whenever a new structure is erected or the height of an existing
structure is increased in the horizontal surface zone so as to cause said structure to project more
than forty feet (40’) above elevation of Airport elevation, and the proposed height of such
structure does not require a permit as herein set forth, a written report shall be given to the
Zoning Administration within ten (10) days after the completion of such alteration or erection,
setting forth the facts relating thereto with sufficient particularity to permit a determination as to
whether such structure conforms to the regulations prescribed herein.
E. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed: Whenever the Zoning Administration determines that a
nonconforming structure or growth has been abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) has been torn
down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or
growth to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the Zoning Regulations, and the
Zoning Administration may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or
growth, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip such object as may be necessary to
conform to the regulations, or, it the owner of the nonconforming structure or growth shall neglect or
refuse to comply with such an order after ten (10) days notice thereof, the Zoning Administration may
proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped; and shall have a lien on
behalf of the City upon the land whereon it is or was located, and in the amount of the costs and expenses
thereof. Such a lien may be enforced by the City by suit in equity for the enforcement thereof, as in the
case of other liens. Except as provided herein, all applications for permits for replacement, change, or
repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted.
F. Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit a growth, or use
his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this Chapter, may apply to the Board of
Appeals for a variance from such regulation. Such variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary
hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest and safety, but would do
substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this Chapter; provided, that any variance may be
17 6
allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the Board of Appeals may deem necessary to effectuate
the purposes of the Chapter.
G. Hazard Marking and Lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this Chapter and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to
require the owner of the structure or growth to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and
lights as may be necessary in the interest of safe air navigation, as shall be determined by the Zoning
Administration, to indicate to flyers the presence of any Airport Hazard; the cost and expense of
installation, operation and maintenance shall be paid by the owner. (Ord. 54; 52653)
