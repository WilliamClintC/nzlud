PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Brookfield, Illinois. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1964 Code, as supplemented through October 27, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the village board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1964 Code, as supplemented, included sections of the village's prior 1940 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER 	CHT:1 
RELATED LAWS 	RL:1 
SPECIAL ACTS 	SA:1 
CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE 	CHTCT:1 
RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE 	RLCT:1 
SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE 	SACT:1

CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CHARTER INDEX 	CHTi:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code that amend, repeal, or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion in this Code. In the case of repealed chapters, sections, or subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, the repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by their omission from affected reprinted pages. The subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed, or as omitted in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of the subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new Code of Ordinances by the village board. 
(Code 1964, § 01-4)

Sec. 2-132. - Travel, meal and lodging expense reimbursement. 
Consistent with the Local Governmental Travel Expense Control Act (P.A. 99-0604) the village allows and will reimburse Village officers and employees for reasonable authorized travel expenses, including meal and lodging expenses, incurred by them in the performance of their duties. This section regulates the reimbursement of all travel, meal, and lodging expenses of officers and employees of the village. 
(1)  Applicability. This section applies to every officer and employee of the village including, but not limited to, all full-time, part-time and temporary employees of the village and all elected officials of the village and appointed board, commission or committee members of the village. 
(2)  Definitions. 
Corporate authorities means the president and the trustees of the village. 
Entertainment includes, but is not limited to, shows, amusements, theaters, circuses, sporting events, or any other place of public or private entertainment or amusement, unless ancillary to the purpose of the program or event. 
Travel means any expenditure directly incident to official travel by employees and officers of the village involving reimbursement to travelers or direct payment to private agencies providing transportation or related services. 
Village means the Village of Brookfield, Illinois. 
(3)  Official business for which expense reimbursement is permitted. 
a.  Village officers and employees are permitted to be reimbursed for the travel, meal and lodging expenses in the following instances: 
1.  Official business travel  Travel that takes the village officer or employee outside of the village relating to official business of the village that is designed to further development, legislation, governance and administration of the village. 
2.  Training and professional/educational travel  Travel that takes the village officer or employee outside of the village related to the attendance at seminars, conferences, workshops, conventions and the like designed to further training, education and professional development of village officers or employees, directly related to their duties. 
3.  Official business meals  Meals eaten within or outside of the village during which the village officer or employee discusses official business of the village that is designed to further development, legislation, governance and administration of the village. 
b.  Commuting to a location within the village and to and from an officer's or employee's normal place of business does not constitute a reimbursable travel expense. 
(4)  Travel, meal and lodging expense authorization. Prior to incurring a travel, meal or lodging expense for which reimbursement is sought, village officers and employees are required to complete the travel authorization form set forth in subsection (8) below. Travel, meal or lodging expenses by employees (except for department heads) must be authorized in advance by the department head and the village manager. Travel, meal or lodging expenses by department heads must be authorized in advance by the village manager. Travel, meal or lodging expenses by village officers (except for the corporate authorities) must be authorized in advance by the village manager. Travel, meal or lodging expenses by the corporate authorities must be authorized in advance by the corporate authorities by a roll call vote at an open meeting of the corporate authorities. 
(5)  Travel, meal and lodging expense reimbursement approval. Within ten days after the return from travel, or in the absence of travel within ten days after incurring the expense, the village officer or employee must complete a travel expense reimbursement form set forth in subsection (9) below supported by the required documentation and submit the form to the village manager. Any travel reimbursement submitted after ten days must include an explanation of the delay. Only delays caused by reasonable circumstances will be approved for reimbursement. Travel, meal and lodging expenses of village officers (except for the corporate authorities) and employees that do not exceed the maximum allowable reimbursement amounts established in this section 2-132 may be approved by the village manager. In the case of emergency or other extraordinary circumstances, travel, meal and lodging expenses that exceed the maximum allowable reimbursement amounts established by this section 2-132 may be approved. All travel, meal and lodging expenses of the corporate authorities and travel, meal and lodging expenses of village officers or employees that exceed the maximum allowable reimbursement amounts established in this section 2-132 shall be approved by the corporate authorities by a roll call vote at an open meeting of the corporate authorities. 
(6)  General travel expense requirements and permitted rates of reimbursement. 
a.  General requirements. 
1.  Village officers and employees are required to utilize all reasonable forms of technology, including, but not limited to, internet, teleconferencing and webinars, to lessen travel expenses incurred. 
2.  The village shall reimburse allowable, authorized travel expenses for official business identified under section 2-132(3) and incurred in the performance of village duties, conditioned on the financial ability of the village and within the budgetary constraints established by the corporate authorities. 
3.  Village officials and employees shall exercise good judgment and proper regard for public funds when incurring travel expenses and when representing the village, by only authorizing the minimum number of staff necessary when travel is required. Personal items and other non-business/non-professional related expenses are not reimbursable. Personnel policies apply when conducting village business, regardless of location. 
4.  In order to minimize the village's total cost per trip, village officers and employees are encouraged to maximize the use of reduced-fare promotions. While travelers are not normally permitted to leave early or stay longer than designated business requires at village expense, they are encouraged to take advantage of reduced fares whenever possible. This may mean leaving in advance, or possibly staying longer. The total cost savings should take into account lost productivity if normal working time is missed. This lengthened stay may be permissible when it can be documented that the net effect is a lower total cost for a trip. This cost saving statement shall be entered on the travel authorization form. 
5.  Persons receiving reimbursement for all incurred expenses shall not receive reimbursement for the same expense from any other public or private source. Officers or employees who sign claims for reimbursement of expenses or who request payment of charges that have been incurred on a credit card or by any other means shall certify that they are the individuals that incurred the expense and that the village is the only entity that will receive a claim for reimbursement of the specific expense. 
b.  Transportation expenses. 
1.  Mode of transportation. Usual local and long distance modes of transportation to destinations authorized for travel in the course of Village business include automobiles, airlines, railroads, buses, taxicabs, ride share services and limousines. In all cases, travel should be by the most economical mode of transportation available, considering travel time and work requirements. 
2.  Routing of travel. Travel shall be by the most direct route. Travel by other routes is allowed when required by the individual's official duties, safety considerations and unusual circumstances. Expenses due to deviations for convenience shall be borne by the officer or employee. Explanations of unusual circumstances shall be reflected in the comment section of the travel expense reimbursement form. Higher cost travel interruptions for individual convenience are not reimbursable. 
3.  Commercial transportation. Individuals will be reimbursed for actual and necessary costs of transportation by airline, railroad or other common carrier following these guidelines: 
(i)  Commercial common carriers. Use of common carriers such as airlines, trains and buses will be reimbursed at actual cost, not to exceed coach fare. Upgrades to higher fares and first class travel will only be considered in emergencies and must be preapproved by the village board and supported by a written statement detailing the circumstances that created the extraordinary expenditure. In all cases, a traveler shall attempt to secure the lowest fare available given scheduling requirements. 
(ii)  Taxicab and ride sharing service fares. Taxicab and ride-sharing service (such as Uber, Lyft, etc.) fares are reimbursable at the actual cost of the fare. Receipts for fares are required for reimbursement. If free van, bus or shuttle service is available and convenient, they are recommended for use in lieu of taxicabs or ride sharing services. 
(iii)  Limousine. Use of a limousine service is reimbursable when there is an economic cost benefit compared to the use of alternative transportation, including parking costs, and must be approved by the village manager in advance. Limousine services will not be reimbursed where it can be demonstrated that use of other transportation can be more cost effective. 
(iv)  Vehicle rentals. A rental vehicle is not to be used as a personal convenience. The rental of an automobile while on travel status is allowed, if circumstances require. The most economical vehicle available that is suitable for the village's business shall be obtained. The collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance on rented vehicles are not reimbursable. Vehicle rentals must be identified on the travel authorization form and preapproved by the village manager. Failure to receive preapproval may result in non-reimbursement. Rental vehicle reimbursement is limited to: 
(a)  A situation that occurs where the traveler's final geographic destination is remote to the transportation terminal and there is no other cost effective conveyance from the common carrier terminal. 
(b)  A situation where there are three or more village travelers and it is cost effective to rent a vehicle in lieu of the total actual round trip cost of the taxi, limousine, etc., for each traveler. 
(c)  A situation where timely flight connections can only be made by utilizing a short-term car rental. 
(v)  Private conveyance. The use of a privately owned means of transportation for village business is permitted when such use is necessary or desirable due to a lack of other convenient means of transportation, or is otherwise advantageous to the village. 
4.  Personal automobiles. Use of personal automobiles for travel will be reimbursed for miles driven at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Standard Mileage Rate for Business in effect at the time of travel. The IRS mileage rate is intended to cover the following expenses: gasoline, normal wear and tear on the vehicle, insurance, and any vehicle damage. In the case of a vehicle accident, the employee's insurance policy will be considered to be the primary insurance coverage. 
(i)  Mileage reimbursement for personal automobile use is limited to travel outside of the village. The official or employee is required to document the mileage by providing a printout from a reliable map source (i.e., MapQuest, Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, etc.) and must attach the printout to the travel expense reimbursement form. 
(ii)  When two or more employees travel in one vehicle, reimbursement will be made to only one employee. The names of all travelers shall be indicated on the travel expense reimbursement form. 
(iii)  Where a personal automobile is used, the mileage allowance is not to exceed the related cost of coach airfare. Reimbursement shall be limited to the lower of coach air fare or actual miles driven times the prevailing IRS Standard Mileage Rate. 
(iv)  Employees using personal automobiles for travel on Village business must have insurance coverage in an amount not less than that required by Section 10-101(b) of the Illinois Vehicle Code [625 ILCS 5/10-101(b)]. The Village Manager shall require employees to file a statement certifying that they are duly licensed and carry at least the minimum insurance coverage. 
5.  Village vehicles. Village vehicles may be used for local travel. Village vehicles should not be used for out-of-state trips where the final destination is more than 100 miles outside of the village, unless it is shown to be the cheaper transportation alternative. Gasoline required for the continued use of a village vehicle where the village's gas pump cannot be used is reimbursable at the actual cost of the expense with receipts required. 
6.  Incidental auto expenses. Certain costs associated with the use of personal or village vehicles are reimbursable. The cost of automobile parking fees, bridge, road and tunnel tolls shall be allowed at the actual cost. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler is away shall be allowed only to the extent that the fees, plus the allowable mileage reimbursement to and from the terminal area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a limousine or taxicab to and from the terminal. Receipts or a printout of an I-PASS account showing time and date are acceptable for reimbursement of tolls paid. 
7.  Reimbursement for transportation in excess of established rates. Reimbursement for transportation in excess of the rates established in this section 2-132(6)b. must be authorized in advance and approved for reimbursement by the corporate authorities by a roll call vote at an open meeting of the corporate authorities. 
c.  Lodging expenses. 
1.  It is the responsibility of each village officer and employee to request the lowest available lodging rate at the time of making reservations. However, a person who due to a handicap may require special lodging consideration may be reimbursed for the actual cost of the least costly lodging that is substantially accessible. Special seminar, conference or government rates shall be sought. 
2.  Lodging reimbursement shall be at actual cost consistent with facilities available and proximity to the location of a conference, seminar or business meeting. Where multiple occupancy involving a spouse and/or other family members has occurred, the village officer or employee may only claim the actual and necessary cost of his or her single occupancy at a single rate. If no single rate exists, the lowest double rate shall be reimbursed. 
3.  Lodging provided by a friend, relative or non-invoicing organization is not reimbursable. 
4.  The number of nights for which an employee may obtain reimbursement will be limited to the number necessary to conduct village business, unless the officer of employee is utilizing a reduced-fare promotion in accordance with section 2-132(6)a.4. of this policy. For those conferences or meetings that begin in the morning, arrival the night before reimbursable. For conferences or meetings that end after 5:00 p.m., lodging expenses for that night will also be reimbursed. Employees are encouraged to return home on the final day of the conference whenever possible. 
5.  Longer stays where lodging is reimbursable are permitted if they result in a significant savings in travel costs, and must be preapproved by the village manager. (See section 2-132(6)a.4.). The employee requesting the reimbursement must document the net savings if longer stays are requested, including the lodging expense and meals. Lost work time should also be taken into account when calculating the cost savings. 
6.  It is not considered prudent to use public funds for overnight lodging within a 75-mile radius of the village; therefore, it is not normally reimbursed. Exceptions to this policy would be: 
(i)  If documented business meetings extend past 8:00 p.m. and then resume again at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. Business meetings, in this instance, do not include dinners, receptions or social functions sponsored for attendees during the evening hours. Employees may attend these functions, at their own expense, and if they choose to remain away from home overnight, lodging expenses will not be reimbursed. Prior approval of the corporate authorities must be obtained for any planned overnight stay within the 75-mile radius. Failure to gain prior approval may result in non-reimbursement. 
(ii)  If weather conditions make a return trip unsafe, then an overnight stay may be reimbursable. 
7.  For each day of an overnight stay, one personal telephone call of reasonable duration will be reimbursed on a lodging bill, telephone credit card or separate cell phone bill. Necessary business calls will be reimbursable. 
8.  Personal items such as movie rentals, clothes cleaning, etc., are not reimbursable. 
9.  Reimbursement for lodging in excess of two times the per diem rates published by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Domestic Per Diem Rates (effective October 1 of each year) (see www.gsa.gov/perdiem), exclusive of taxes and fees, must be authorized in advance and approved for reimbursement by the corporate authorities by a roll call vote at an open meeting of the corporate authorities. 
d.  Meal expenses. Expenses for breakfast, lunch and dinner amounts will be reimbursed in accordance with the meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) breakdown established by the GSA. (See www.gsa.gov.) Reimbursement for expenses for meals shall not exceed the per diem amounts set forth in the published U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Domestic Per Diem Rates (effective October 1 of each year). (See www.gsa.gov/perdiem.) The meals and incidental expense (M&IE) rate will be paid based on the destination location of authorized travel. 
1.  Breakfast is reimbursable when an officer or employee is traveling and leaves the village or his or her personal residence (if reporting directly to the destination) at or before 6:00 a.m. 
2.  Lunch is reimbursable when an officer or employee is traveling and leaves the village or his or her personal residence (if reporting directly to the destination) at or before 12:00 noon. 
3.  Dinner is reimbursable when an officer or employee is traveling and arrives back at the village offices or his or her personal residence (if reporting directly from destination) at or after 7:00 p.m. For employees commencing travel after close of business, but before 6:30 p.m., dinner reimbursement may be allowed. 
4.  Reimbursement for meals in excess of the per diem rates published by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Domestic Per Diem Rates (effective October 1 of each year) (see www.gsa.gov/perdiem) must be authorized in advance and approved for reimbursement by the corporate authorities by a roll call vote at an open meeting of the corporate authorities. 
e.  Special expenses. 
1.  Registration fees and materials related to professional/educational activities. 
(i)  Actual registration fee expenditure and reimbursement is allowed for authorized attendance of professional/educational activities, with prior approval by the village manager. Advance registration should be used where the amount of the registration fee increases as the date of the event approaches. 
(ii)  Books and related materials such as conference tapes are reimbursable costs. The items purchased shall become the property of the village. 
2.  Service tips. Tips for services provided during travel not associated with meals (or requested elsewhere) shall be included for reimbursement on the travel expense reimbursement form. An officer or employee may request reimbursement up to 20 percent for documented tips and up to $5.00 for undocumented tips. 
3.  Village business meetings. The cost of village business related to special expenses incurred while hosting a meeting shall be reimbursable, when authorized by the village manager in advance and if reasonable, well-documented and budgeted. 
(i)  All special expenses shall be itemized and fully documented to include the actual village business transacted and the individuals and their affiliation. The actual cost of meals for other persons incurred in connection with official village business shall be allowed.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 4-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the village in order to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the village. 
(b)  The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is obscene. 
(Code 1964, § 07-146; Ord. No. 1977-34, § 1, 8-22-1977; Ord. No. 2002-36, 7-22-2002)  
Sec. 4-2. - Findings. 
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses presented to the village from findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie vs. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000); Barnes vs. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); City of Renton vs. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986); Young vs. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976); Berg vs. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir 1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters vs. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th> Cir. 1982); Bamon Corp vs. City of Dayton, 730 F.Supp. 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990) and EWAP Inc. vs. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App. 3d 179,158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on studies in other cities including the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, 1989); Memorandum re. Adult Entertainment Ordinance, of the Assistant Chief of Police of Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., Report to the American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses (March 31, 1996); Adult Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, an Analysis (1984); and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of Garden Grove. The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard, (Garden Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), this village finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
(3)  Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions. 
(4)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities. 
(5)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view. 
(6)  The findings noted in this section raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns. 
(7)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns. 
(8)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(9)  The regulation of nudity, semi-nudity, and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(10)  Requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws, thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(11)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal, state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(12)  A person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business. 
(13)  Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(Code 1964, § 07-146; Ord. No. 1977-34, § 1, 8-22-1977; Ord. No. 2002-36, 7-22-2002)

The veterinarian observing such dog or other owned animal shall report the clinical condition of the animal immediately, with confirmation in writing to the police chief of the village, or his designee, within 24 hours after the animal is presented for examination, giving the owner's name, address, the date of confinement, the breed, description, age, and sex of the animal, and whether the animal has been spayed or neutered. At the end of the confinement period, the veterinarian shall submit a written report to the police chief of the village, or his designee, advising him of the final disposition of the owned animal. When evidence is presented that the owned animal was inoculated against rabies within the time prescribed by law, it shall be confined in a house, or in a manner which will prohibit it from biting any person for a period of ten days, if a licensed veterinarian adjudges such confinement satisfactory. The village manager may permit such confinement to be reduced to a period of less than ten days. At the end of the confinement period, the owned animal shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian. 
(b)  Any person having knowledge that any person has been bitten by an owned animal shall notify the village police department promptly. It is unlawful for the owner of the animal to euthanize, sell, give away, or otherwise dispose of any owned animal known to have bitten a person until it is released by the police chief of the village or the village manager, or their authorized designee. It is unlawful for the owner of the animal to refuse or fail to comply with the reasonable written or printed instructions provided by the police chief of the village or the village manager, or their authorized designee. If such instructions cannot be delivered in person, they shall be mailed to the owner of the animal by regular mail. Any expense incurred in the handling of an animal under this section shall be borne by the owner. 
(c)  When a person has been bitten by a police dog that is currently vaccinated against rabies, the police dog may continue to perform its duties for the peace officer or law enforcement agency, and any period of observation of the police dog may be under the supervision of a police officer. The supervision shall consist of the dog being locked in a kennel, performing its official duties in a police vehicle, or remaining under the constant supervision of its police handler.

DIVISION 7. - SOLICITORS 
 
Sec. 14-358. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Uninvited visits to private residential properties and privately owned businesses for the purposes of soliciting funds, goods, wares, merchandise or services by persons and organizations have been occurring and continue to occur within the village. 
(2)  Residents and business owners have complained that these activities are intrusive upon their privacy and disruptive to their daily activities. 
(3)  A variety of misrepresentations and other frauds are at times employed in such activities. 
(4)  Burglaries and attacks on persons in their homes have occurred by persons claiming to be solicitors. 
(5)  The village has a legitimate and substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, and welfare of its residents by preventing fraudulent or criminal activities which may result from unregulated solicitation. 
(6)  Noncommercial speech is entitled to broader protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution than commercial speech, affording the village a greater ability to regulate commercial speech than noncommercial speech. 
(7)  An effective way to promote and protect persons' safety and privacy is by reasonably limiting the hours of solicitation and requiring solicitors to obtain permits in a content-neutral manner. Allowing individuals to determine their level of comfort with privacy and whether or not they want to receive solicitation will promote the village's interest in promoting public safety and protecting individuals' privacy, while respecting solicitors' interests in effective distribution of information. A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this division, which regulates the time, place and manner of solicitations. 
(b)  Based on the findings described above, it is further found that there is a need for narrowly tailored reasonable time, place and manner restrictions regarding soliciting within the village so as to accomplish the following, to the extent reasonably possible: 
(1)  Provide for the safety of the public and property; 
(2)  Deter fraud and crime by determining the identity of solicitors by requiring solicitors to obtain a permit prior to soliciting within the village; 
(3)  Restrict the unreasonable interference with privacy by reasonably restricting the hours of solicitation activities; 
(4)  Prohibit the solicitation of occupants of property when the occupant has posted a sign prohibiting such activities; and 
(5)  Respect the solicitors' interests in effective distribution of information.

(Ord. No. 2008-67, § 300.0, 8-11-2008)  
Sec. 20-21. - How to use this article. 
(a)  The chief building inspector shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 20-22. 
(b)  To fulfill those duties, the chief building inspector shall first use the criteria listed in section 20-23 to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. 
(c)  Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, he must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified. 
(1)  If the site is within a flood fringe, the chief building inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section 20-24 be met. 
(2)  If the site is within a floodway, the chief building inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section 20-25 be met. 
(3)  If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the chief building inspector shall require that the minimum requirements of section 20-26 be met. 
(d)  In addition, the general requirements of section 20-27 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of section 20-24, 20-25, or 20-26. 
(e)  The chief building inspector shall ensure that all subdivision proposals meet the requirements of section 20-28. 
(f)  If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the chief building inspector shall review the requirements of section 20-29 to make sure they are met. In addition, the chief building inspector shall complete all notification requirements. 
(g)  In order to ensure that property owners obtain permits as required in this article, the chief building inspector may take any and all actions as outlined in section 20-31. 
(Ord. No. 2008-67, § 400.0, 8-11-2008)  
Sec. 20-22. - Duties of the chief building inspector. 
(a)  Determining the floodplain designation. 
(1)  Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
(2)  If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile. 
(3)  Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this article. 
(b)  Professional engineer review. 
(1)  If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer under the employ or contract of the chief building inspector for review to ensure that the development meets section 20-25 or 20-26. 
(2)  In the case of an appropriate use, the professional engineer shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section 20-25. 
(c)  Dam safety requirements. 
(1)  Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure. 
(2)  The construction or major modification of all Class I (high hazard) and Class II (moderate hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit. 
(3)  Some Class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off-channel detention basins that have an embankment are nonjurisdictional Class III dams. It is not required that IDNR/OWR sign off on all nonjurisdictional Class III dams. 
(4)  A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required. 
(5)  A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams. 
(6)  Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. 
(d)  Other permit requirements. Ensure any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit. 
(e)  Plan review and permit issuance. 
(1)  Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this article; and 
(2)  Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this article and other regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of this article. 
(f)  Inspection review. 
(1)  Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this article; and 
(2)  Schedule, on an annual basis, an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection. 
(g)  Damage determinations. Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged structures which must comply with section 20-30(c). 
(h)  Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain permit files, including: 
(1)  An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, of a residential or nonresidential building subject to section 20-27; and/or 
(2)  The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to section 20-27. 
(i)  Records for public inspection. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and as-built elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this article. 
(j)  State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR for all development projects subject to sections 20-25 and 20-26, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the village. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR: 
(1)  Organizations which are exempt from this article, as per the state compiled statutes. 
(2)  IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures, as defined in section 20-20, and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the village and county, except for those projects meeting the requirements of section 20-25(2)a.

(6)  Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and streams. 
(7)  Any changes in the mapped floodway or published flood profiles. 
(k)  Cooperation with other agencies. 
(1)  Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this article; 
(2)  Submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a regulatory map within six months whenever a modification of the floodplain may change the base flood elevation or result in a change to the floodplain map; 
(3)  Submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program; and 
(4)  Notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this article. 
(l)  Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this article, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes. 
(Ord. No. 2008-67, § 500.0, 8-11-2008)  
Sec. 20-23. - Base flood elevation. 
(a)  This article's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the village. 
(1)  If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. 
(2)  When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site. 
(b)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Des Plaines River and Salt Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the county prepared by FEMA, dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(c)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of the unincorporated county that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the flood insurance study of the county prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(d)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an AH Zone or AO Zone shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the county-wide flood insurance rate map. 
(e)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an A Zone on the county-wide flood insurance rate map shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations. 
(1)  When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP. 
(2)  The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. 
(3)  For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study. 
(4)  For an unmapped extended SFHA with a drainage area less than one square mile, which has been identified by the chief building inspector pursuant to section 20-22(a)(3), the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in subsection (e) of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2008-67, § 600.0, 8-11-2008)  
Sec. 20-24. - Occupation and use of flood fringe areas. 
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this article. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of section 20-27. 
(1)  Development permit. 
a.  No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the chief building inspector. 
b.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the chief building inspector. 
1.  The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. 
2.  For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 20-27. 
c.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the chief building inspector shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
1.  Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map without a permit as required by this article is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this article. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map, is subject to the provisions of this article. 
2.  The chief building inspector shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
d.  A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
e.  The chief building inspector shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers that may be required for this type of activity. The chief building inspector shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
a.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
b.  Compensatory storage. 
1.  Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. 
2.  The excavation volume shall be at least equal to the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. 
3.  In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. 
4.  All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. 
5.  All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(3)  Construction of the lowest floor below the base flood elevation (BFE). A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The chief building inspector shall not issue such a permit unless the applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections. 
a.  Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection (2)b of this section. 
b.  The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, access ways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE). 
c.  The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet beyond the outside face of the structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the chief building inspector may waive the ten foot minimum setback if a state licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the chief building inspector for review. The chief building inspector may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
d.  The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of 20 feet from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the chief building inspector may waive the 20 foot minimum setback distance if a state licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures have been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding, shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet. 
e.  The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet thick under the basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of a LOMR-F, if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML according to ASTM standard D-2487, Classification of Soils for Engineering Purposes. 
f.  The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same direction. 
g.  All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by a state licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the site conditions. 
h.  The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five feet below the BFE. 
i.  There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-quarter horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure. 
j.  The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow. 
k.  All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices. 
l.  If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding subsections, the chief building inspector shall allow the construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and requirements set forth in FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA Technical Bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared by a state licensed professional engineer. 
m.  In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed 18 inches, as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted.

1.  The chief building inspector shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. 
2.  A licensed professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the village, shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
a.  Approved appropriate uses. The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this article. Only those appropriate uses listed in 17 Ill. Admin. Code Part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
1.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
2.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses. 
3.  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls. 
4.  Underground and overhead utilities. 
5.  Recreational facilities, such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
6.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage. 
7.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways, and any modification thereto. 
8.  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
(i)  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one foot; or 
(ii)  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
9.  Designated floodway regarding, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slop toward a watercourse. 
10.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures, including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
11.  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to 50 percent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
12.  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows, including, but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building is improved to 50 percent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
b.  Inappropriate uses. Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials, except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. 
c.  Engineering and mitigation criteria. Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use will be considered permissible, provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 20-27: 
1.  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(i)  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, Open Channel Hydraulics, McGraw-Hill, New York 1959). 
(ii)  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions, unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state, or local unit of government can ensure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
(iii)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
A.  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every four feet of the flooded stream's length. 
B.  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot horizontal for every one foot of the flooded stream's length. 
C.  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot vertical transition for every ten feet of stream length shall be used. 
D.  Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
E.  All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
2.  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. 
(i)  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. 
(ii)  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least the volume of floodplain storage lost. 
(iii)  Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. 
(iv)  The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

9.  Channel modifications. If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(i)  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. 
(ii)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values. 
(iii)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
A.  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
B.  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
C.  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
D.  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
E.  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
F.  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
G.  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
H.  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
I.  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
J.  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood, unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
K.  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification. 
(iv)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section. 
10.  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
11.  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than 15 days prior to the initiation of improvements. 
(ii)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within 15 days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within 15 days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 60 days. 
(iii)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment traps and basins. 
(iv)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least 25 feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see subsection (2)c.16 of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
(v)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
12.  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
13.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
(i)  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section 20-23, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
(ii)  If the 100-year designated floodway elevation, at the site of the proposed construction, is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
A.  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and 
B.  Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
(iii)  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
14.  Conditional letter of map revision. 
(i)  If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
(ii)  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities are submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
(iii)  In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
(iv)  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
(v)  After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.

(ii)  Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established upon completion of construction. 
17.  Change of floodway designation. After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the as-built plans.

ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING 
 
Sec. 26-81. - Findings. 
(a)  The general assembly of the state has found that tobacco smoke is a harmful and dangerous carcinogen to human beings and a hazard to public health. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes at least 65,000 deaths each year from heart disease and lung cancer according to the National Cancer Institute. Secondhand tobacco smoke causes heart disease, stroke, cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, low-birth-weight in infants, asthma and exacerbation of asthma, bronchitis and pneumonia in children and adults. Secondhand tobacco smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United States. State workers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke are at increased risk of premature death. An estimated 2,900 citizens of the state die each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. 
(b)  The general assembly of the state has also found that the United States Surgeon General's 2006 report has determined that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke; the scientific evidence that secondhand smoke causes serious diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses such as bronchitis and asthma, is massive and conclusive; separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate secondhand smoke exposure; smoke-free workplace policies are effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure; and smoke-free workplace policies do not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. 
(c)  The general assembly of the state has further found that the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are capable only of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments because it cannot determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer-causing chemicals, and ASHRAE acknowledges that technology does not exist that can remove chemicals that cause cancer from the air. A June 30, 2005, ASHRAE position document on secondhand smoke concludes that, at present, the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to eliminate all smoking activities indoors.

ARTICLE III. - PUBLICATION DISPENSING DEVICES  
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 46-130. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The village has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way are not unreasonably obstructed by publication dispensing devices, and that publication dispensing devices are properly maintained. 
(b)  The public rights-of-way historically have been used to circulate publications. 
(c)  The substantial growth in the number of publications has produced a proliferation of freestanding publication dispensing devices located on public rights-of-way that have contributed to the congestion of public sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, interfered with the use of streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way; and poorly maintained or abandoned, freestanding publication dispensing devices have presented hazards to persons and property, contributed to the litter problems of public sidewalks and resulted in visual blight. 
(d)  The village has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities and, to that end, the village must take steps to reduce the visual blight, the inconvenience and the hazards associated with unlimited numbers and designs of publication dispensing devices, poorly maintained publication dispensing devices and the virtually unrestricted placement of publication dispensing devices on public streets, public sidewalks and public rights-of-way. 
(e)  The unregulated placement and maintenance of individual publication dispensing devices in the public rights-of-way interferes with the free and unimpeded use of such public rights-of-way, and threatens the health, safety and welfare of persons who use the public rights-of-way, including pedestrians, children, the aged, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, drivers, persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services, and persons with disabilities. 
(f)  The unregulated placement of multicolored, broken, rusted and abandoned individual publication dispensing devices of various shapes and sizes in the public right-of-ways significantly detracts from the aesthetic character of surrounding areas. Due to the limited space available and the congestion on certain public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way, the village has a substantial interest in devising an approach to placement of publication dispensing devices in those areas that promote public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic quality of the village. 
(g)  An effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of publication dispensing devices is to prohibit freestanding publication dispensing devices in congested areas and to allow only modular publication dispensing devices in these areas. This objective may be achieved by creating a modular publication dispensing device district in congested areas or areas that have particular public safety, aesthetic, historical or economic concerns and the permitting of freestanding publication dispensing devices outside these districts. Allowing modular publication dispensing devices and prohibiting freestanding publication dispensing devices and unauthorized modular publication dispensing devices in modular publication dispensing device districts and regulating the location of publication dispensing devices on the public right-of-way and other public areas outside of the modular publication dispensing device districts will promote the village's interest in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the village, and advancing the economic interests of the village's businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion, while respecting publication's interests in effective distribution. A reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this article, which regulates the placement, size, construction design, maintenance, and appearance of publication dispensing devices in specified areas. 
(h)  Based on the findings described above, it is further found that there is a need for reasonable time, place and manner restrictions regarding the installation, placement, size, appearance and maintenance of publication dispensing devices in the public rights-of-way. Consistent with these findings, it is the purpose of this article to promote the health, safety and welfare of users of the public rights-of-way and to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the village by controlling the placement, size, construction and appearance of publication dispensing devices and modular publication dispensing devices in a manner which may utilize publication dispensing devices as a method of distribution of publications, so as to accomplish the following, to the extent reasonably possible: 
(1)  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience. 
(2)  Restrict unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including ingress and egress from any residence or place of business or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles. 
(3)  Provide for the safety of the public and property during windstorms and other inclement weather. 
(4)  Replace, remove, or relocate individual publication dispensing devices that have created visual blight on the public rights-of-way or unreasonably detracted from the aesthetics of adjacent businesses, landscaping and other improvements. 
(5)  Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties. 
(6)  Reduce unnecessary exposure of the public to personal injury and property damage. 
(7)  Ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly located publication dispensing devices. 
(8)  Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb ramps and locations used for public transportation services. 
(9)  Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained, improperly located or abandoned publication dispensing devices. 
(10)  Protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the village. 
(11)  Advance the economic interests of the village's businesses and residents, including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of publications through publication dispensing devices. 
(12)  Respect the publisher's interests in effective distribution, including: 
a.  Allowing publications currently distributed from freestanding publication dispensing devices to receive distribution space in modular publication dispensing devices located at, or as close as reasonably possible to, the locations of such freestanding publication dispensing devices; 
b.  Allowing publications not currently distributed from freestanding publication dispensing devices to receive distribution space in modular publication dispensing devices; 
c.  Allowing the number, locations, and usage of modular publication dispensing devices to change over time in response to changing market conditions; and 
d.  Providing for modular publication dispensing devices and prompt and effective maintenance, repair and replacement of freestanding publication dispensing devices, including providing for the maintenance, repair and replacement of parts of such publication dispensing devices which, if not thus maintained, repaired or replaced, could significantly impede the effective use of such publication dispensing device. 
(i)  This article is not intended to and does not ban freestanding publication dispensing devices on public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way throughout the village outside of modular publication dispensing device districts. Subject to the requirements of this article, freestanding publication dispensing devices may continue to be placed on public sidewalks, streets and public rights-of-way in areas of the village that are not within modular publication dispensing device districts created pursuant to this article. Publications also may continue to be distributed within modular publication dispensing device districts created pursuant to this article by all authorized means other than freestanding publication dispensing devices.

(4)  Employer's liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000.00 per employee and per accident. 
If the utility is not providing such insurance to protect the contractors and subcontractors performing the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section. 
(b)  Excess or umbrella policies. The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage over underlying insurance on a following-form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to cover such loss. 
(c)  Copies required. The utility shall provide copies of any of the policies required by this section to the village within ten days following receipt of a written request therefor from the village. 
(d)  Maintenance and renewal of required coverages. The insurance policies required by this section shall contain the following endorsement:

Within ten days after receipt by the village of said notice, and in no event later than ten days prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section. 
(e)  Self-insurance. A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit requirements required by subsection (a) of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds under subsection (a) of this section, or the requirements of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section. A utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under subsection (a) of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self insurer" under the Workers Compensation Act. 
(f)  Effect of insurance and self-insurance on utility's liability. The legal liability of the utility to the village and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance required by this section shall not be limited by such insurance policies or self-insurance or by the recovery of any amounts thereunder. 
(g)  Insurance companies. All insurance provided pursuant to this section shall be effected under valid and enforceable policies, issued by insurers legally able to conduct business with the licensee in the state. All insurance carriers and surplus line carriers shall be rated "A-" or better and of a class size "X" or higher by A.M. Best Company.

The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article.

(3)  Complete restoration of the work area to a condition equal to or better than the original condition. All turf must be established to the satisfaction of the village prior to release of the security fund. All pavement repairs must be a minimum of one year old prior to release of the security fund. 
(4)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article, including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and

(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon 14 days advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund; or 
(5)  Fails to restore the work area to the complete satisfaction of the village as required by this article. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon three years from the date of completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee. Upon application to the director of public works, said security deposit may be reduced by 125 percent of the cost to complete restoration. 
(h)  Rights not limited. The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund, shall affect any other right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated.

(g)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocate small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(h)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than 10 feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
(1)  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
(2)  45 feet above ground level. 
(i)  Height exceptions. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variation in conformance with procedures, terms, and conditions set forth in division 4 (variances) of article VIII (interpretations, appeals and variances) of chapter 62 (zoning) of this Code. 
(j)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(k)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with section 46-437 (location of facilities) of article VII (utility construction in rights-of-way) of this Code concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. If an applicant proposes a facility to be located in the public right-of-way which would not comply with the requirements of section 46-437, the applicant shall apply for a variation in conformance with procedures, terms, and conditions set forth in division 4 (variances) of article VIII (interpretations, appeals and variances) of chapter 62 (zoning) of this Code. 
(l)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with section 46-437 (location of facilities) of article VII (utility construction in rights-of-way) of this Code concerning the location of facilities in the right-of-way and prohibiting certain above-ground facilities. If an applicant proposes an above-ground facility to be located in the public right-of-way which would not comply with the requirements of said section 46-437, the applicant shall apply for a variation in conformance with procedures, terms, and conditions set forth in division 4 (variances) of article VIII (interpretations, appeals and variances) of chapter 62 (zoning) of this Code. 
(m)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant. 
(n)  Cooperation with other small wireless service providers. As a condition of any permit for installation of a new pole, small wireless support structure, or other above-ground facility granted pursuant to this article, permittees shall be required to cooperate with other small wireless providers in collocating additional small wireless facilities on poles and small wireless support structures owned by the permittee, provided that such proposed additional small wireless provider been issued permits for that location by the village as described herein. All permittees shall exercise good faith in collocating other small wireless providers regarding sharing of the permitted site, provided that such shared use does not give rise to a substantial technical level of impairment of the ability to provide the permitted use (i.e., significant interference in broadcast or reception capabilities as opposed to a competitive conflict or financial burden). Such good faith shall include sharing technical information to evaluate the feasibility of sharing utility poles or small wireless infrastructure. In the event that a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other users, the village may require a third-party technical study at the expense of the applicant, the permittee, or both.

(1)  Provide a variety of locations and options for wireless providers while minimizing the negative visual impacts associated with small wireless facilities; 
(2)  Encourage creative approaches in locating and designing small wireless facilities that blend in with the surroundings of such facilities; 
(3)  Provide standards that comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "Telecommunications Act") and the Small Wireless Facilities Deployment Act (50 ILCS 835/1 et seq.); the provisions of this Section are not intended, and shall not be interpreted, to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting personal wireless services as defined in the Telecommunications Act; and 
(4)  Administer the provisions of this article in such a manner as not to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services, as defined in the Telecommunications Act. 
(b)  Site location and development of small wireless facilities shall preserve the existing character of the surrounding buildings and landscape to the extent consistent with the function of the proposed small wireless facilities. All small wireless support infrastructure and poles shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance to the existing topography shall be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less adverse visual impact to the surrounding area. The following provisions establish design and concealment standards for small wireless facilities. 
(1)  Building attachment : Small wireless facilities may be mounted to a building if the antennas do not interrupt the building's architectural theme. To the extent possible, all small wireless facilities shall be concealed within a structure that is architecturally compatible with the existing rooftop. Rooftop additions shall be concealed on all sides. 
a.  Small wireless facilities attached to the side or roof of buildings shall employ a symmetrical, balanced design for all facade-mounted antennas. Subsequent deployments will be required to ensure consistent design, architectural treatment, and symmetry when placing antennas on the structure's exterior with any existing small wireless facilities on the same side of the structure. 
b.  The interruption of architectural lines or horizontal or vertical reveals is prohibited unless demonstrated to be unavoidable. 
c.  New architectural features such as columns, pilasters, corbels, or other ornamentation that conceal antennas may be used if it complements the architecture of the existing building. 
d.  Small wireless facilities shall utilize the smallest mounting brackets necessary in order to provide the smallest offset from the building. 
e.  Skirts or shrouds shall be utilized on the sides and bottoms of antennas in order to conceal mounting hardware, create a cleaner appearance, and minimize the visual impact of the antennas. Exposed conduit, cabling, and wiring are prohibited. 
f.  Small wireless facilities shall be painted and textured to match the adjacent building surfaces. 
g.  All installations of small wireless facilities shall have permission from the pole/structure owner to install facilities on such structure. 
(2)  Signs : 
a.  Small wireless facilities replicating a sign shall be subject to the requirements of chapter 42 (signs) of this Code. A sign permit is required unless the small wireless facilities are placed entirely within an existing sign. 
b.  All antennas shall be completely screened by the facade of the sign. 
c.  All cables and conduit to and from the sign shall be routed from within the building wall or structure upon which the sign is mounted. Cable coverings may be allowed on the exterior of the building wall in limited circumstances in situations where they are minimally visible and concealed to match the adjacent building surfaces. 
(3)  Existing or replacement utility poles : An existing utility pole may be replaced or altered to accommodate small wireless facilities and related equipment subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Replacement utility poles shall conform to any design standard for the surrounding zoning district, subdivision, or planned development, including, but not limited to, historic districts as defined herein and planned developments as described in chapter 62 (zoning) of this Code. The replacement pole shall look substantially the same as existing poles in the surrounding zoning district, subdivision, or planned unit development. 
b.  When no design standard is identified for a particular zoning district, subdivision, or planned unit development, replacement poles shall match the height, width, color, and material of the original or adjacent poles. The maximum height of any new or replacement pole shall not exceed limits specified in section 46-449(h), subject to any variation requested pursuant to section 46-449(i). The village may, likewise, approve minor variations of up to 50 percent of the pole width or 30 inches, whichever is greater, when housing equipment within the pole base. 
c.  Replacement poles shall be located as close as possible to the existing pole to be replaced, and the replaced pole shall be removed. 
d.  Wherever compatible with the pole design and technologically feasible, all equipment and cabling shall be internal to the replacement street lighting or traffic signal standard or otherwise camouflaged to appear to be an integrated part of a utility pole. If equipment or cabling is not proposed to be placed internal to the replacement pole, a concealment element plan shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of section 46-458(c) of this article. 
e.  No illumination: Small wireless facilities shall not be illuminated. 
f.  Generators and backup battery: Generators are not permitted for small wireless facilities. All proposed battery backups must be requested through the submittal of a concealment element plan in accordance with the provisions of section 46-458(c) of this article. 
g.  Cabinet location and dimensions: The equipment cabinet for small wireless facilities shall be the smallest amount of cabinet enclosure necessary to enclose the equipment. Disconnect switches may be located outside of the primary equipment cabinet. 
h.  Flush-mounting and pole-top antennas: In situations when interior concealment is demonstrated not to be possible, the small wireless facility shall, to the full extent permitted under the state electrical code and the utilities' requirements, be flush-mounted on the subject pole, which means mounting directly to the pole with little to no gap other than that which may be required for the screws/bolts, or located at the top of the pole. Canisters attached to the top of a pole shall not exceed the diameter of the pole unless technically required, and then shall not be more than 50 percent greater than the diameter of the pole. 
i.  Antenna design: Where an enclosure is proposed to house an antenna, the antenna shall be located in an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet in volume, or in case of an antenna that has exposed elements, the antenna and all of its exposed elements could fit within an enclosure of no more than six cubic feet. No more than four antennas are permitted on a single pole and with a total volume not to exceed 24 cubic feet. 
j.  Material and color: If interior concealment described in section 46-458(b)(3)d. is not possible, the small wireless facility shall to the maximum extent feasible match the color of the pole and shall be non-reflective. 
(4)  New poles : 
a.  In areas of the village in which above-ground facilities are allowed in the public right-of-way pursuant to section 46-437 (location of facilities) of article VII (utility construction in rights-of-way) of this Code, the installation of a new pole for the purpose of locating small wireless facilities is permitted only when the applicant establishes that: 
1.  The small wireless facility cannot be located on a site outside of the public right-of-way such as a public park, public property, or in or on a building whether by roof or panel-mount or separate structure; and 
2.  The small wireless facility cannot be located on an existing pole within the public right-of-way. 
b.  The applicant shall establish the foregoing requirements by submission of competent documentary evidence that: 
1.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required that will meet the requirements of applicant's engineering plans; 
2.  Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless support structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
3.  Existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless support structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed small wireless facility; 
4.  The applicant's proposed small wireless facility would cause electromagnetic interference with the existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless facilities, or the existing utility poles, towers, base stations; or small wireless facilities would cause interference with the applicant's proposed small wireless facility; 
5.  The fees, costs, and contractual provisions required by the owners of the existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless support structures to share existing space, or to adapt existing structures for sharing space, are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable; 
6.  There are other limiting factors which render existing utility poles, towers, base stations, or small wireless support structures unsuitable; and 
7.  Reasonable efforts to develop an alternative location on an existing utility pole, tower, or small wireless support structure have been made. 
Any proposed new utility pole or small wireless support structure proposed by an applicant shall comply with a preferred concealment technique as described in section 46-458(b)(3), or an approved concealment element plan as provided in section 46-458(c). 
(5)  Ground-mounted equipment standards; ADA compliance required : To allow full use of the public right-of-way by pedestrians, bicycles, and other users, all ground-mounted equipment other than poles or wireless support structures shall be housed underground in a vault meeting the village's construction standards. The location of wireless support structures, replacement poles, and/or any new poles shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), village construction standards, and state and federal regulations in order to provide a clear and safe passage within the public right-of-way. 
(6)  Maximum noise levels : No small wireless facilities or related equipment shall be operated to produce noise levels above 40 decibels as measured from the nearest property line to which the small wireless facility is located. 
(7)  Advertising prohibited : No lettering, symbols, images, or trademarks large enough to be legible to pedestrian or vehicular users of the right-of-way, or other persons occupying the space in the immediate area of the small wireless facility, utility pole, or small wireless support structure shall be placed on or affixed to any utility pole, small wireless support structure, or small wireless facility other than as required by Federal Communications Commission regulations or other applicable law. Small wireless facilities concealed within signs or billboards shall not be construed to be in violation of this prohibition. 
(c)  Concealment element plan: 
(1)  Concealment element plan required : Applications for proposed small wireless facility installations which do not conform to a preferred concealment technique as identified in section 46-458(b)(3) shall submit a concealment element plan. The plan shall include the design of the screening, fencing, or other concealment technology for a base station, pole, or equipment structure, and all related transmission equipment or facilities associated with the proposed small wireless facility. 
(2)  Purpose of concealment element plan, generally : Concealment element plans should seek to minimize the visual obtrusiveness of proposed small wireless facilities using methods including, but not limited to, integrating the installation with architectural features or building design components, utilization of coverings or concealment devices of similar material, color and texture, or the appearance thereof, as the surface or background against which the small wireless facility will be seen or on which it will be installed. Other concealment element approaches may include, but not be limited to, use of street furniture concealment products such as trash cans, benches, information kiosks, or other types of enclosures reasonably compatible to conceal ground level equipment. Additionally, the use of a concealment support or device, such as a clock tower, steeple, flagpole, tree, wayfinding sign, decorative pole with banner, art work, street sign, or other applicable concealment structure may be approved. 
(3)  Review of concealment element plan : Where a small wireless facility is proposed that does not comply with a preferred concealment technique as specified in section 46-458(b)(3), a concealment element plan shall be subject to village review and approval in conformance with the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in division 4 (variances) of article VIII (interpretations, appeals and variances) of chapter 62 (zoning) of this Code.

DIVISION 2. - STOP SIGN PLACEMENT CRITERIA 
 
Sec. 54-385. - Determination by village board. 
Whenever traffic is intended to be controlled by a permanent traffic-control stop sign device upon streets under the jurisdiction of the village, a determination shall be made by the village board that conditions warrant such installation. Consideration for the permanent installation of a stop sign will be based on the criteria provided in this division. 
(Code 1964, § 18-107; Ord. No. 89-44, 9-25-1989)  
Sec. 54-386. - Mandatory criteria. 
(a)  Permanent installation of a stop sign shall require that one or more of the following conditions exists: 
(1)  Intersection of a less important street with a main street where application of the normal right-of-way rule is unduly hazardous. 
(2)  Street entering a through highway or street. 
(3)  Unsignalized intersection in a signalized area. 
(4)  Other intersections where a combination of high speed, restricted view, and serious accident record indicates a need for control by a stop sign. 
(5)  An accident problem as indicated by five or more reported accidents of a type within a 12-month period, susceptible to correction by a stop sign installation. Such accidents include right and left turn collisions as well as right angle collisions. 
(b)  Stop signs shall not be erected at intersections where traffic-control signals are operating. However, this does not preclude the installation of stop signs at such intersections where traffic-control signals may be rendered inoperable. 
(Code 1964, § 18-107; Ord. No. 89-44, 9-25-1989)  
Sec. 54-387. - Discretionary criteria. 
To assist in the review process for the installation of stop signs, the following considerations are offered as guidelines in the placement of such stop sign: 
(1)  Where two main highways intersect, stop signs should normally be posted on the minor street to stop the lesser flow of traffic. Traffic engineering studies, however may justify a decision to install a stop sign on the major street. 
(2)  Stop signs may be used at selected railroad-highway grade crossings only after their need has been determined by a detailed traffic engineering study. 
(3)  The "multi-way stop" installation is useful as a safety measure at some locations. It should ordinarily be used only where the volume of traffic on the intersection streets is approximately equal. 
(4)  Prior to the application of any warrants as contained herein, consideration is to be given to less restrictive measures, such as the yield sign where a full stop is not necessary at all times. 
(Code 1964, § 18-107; Ord. No. 89-44, 9-25-1989)  
Sec. 54-388. - Minimum traffic volume. 
(a)  Unless otherwise specifically provided by the village board based on expressed considerations of public safety and convenience, stop signs shall not be installed unless the intersection under consideration meets or exceeds the following minimum traffic volume measurements: 
(1)  The total vehicular volume entering the intersection from all approaches must average at least 500 vehicles per hour for any eight hours of an average day; and 
(2)  The combined vehicular and pedestrian volume from the minor street or highway must average at least 200 units per hour for the same eight hours, with an average delay to minor street vehicular traffic of at least 30 seconds per vehicle during the maximum hour. 
(b)  However, when the 85 percentile approach speed of the major street traffic exceeds 40 miles per hour, the minimum vehicular volume warrant is 70 percent of the above requirements. 
(Code 1964, § 18-107; Ord. No. 89-44, 9-25-1989)  
Sec. 54-389. - Additional criteria for multi-way stop signs. 
Any of the following conditions warrant consideration of a multi-way stop sign installation: 
(1)  Where traffic signals are warranted and urgently needed, the multi-way stop is an interim measure that can be installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the signal installation. 
(2)  An accident problem, as indicated by five or more reported accidents, reported within a 12-month period of a type susceptible to correction by a multi-way stop sign installation, including right and left turn collisions as well as right angle collisions. 
(Code 1964, § 18-107; Ord. No. 89-44, 9-25-1989)  
Sec. 54-390. - Placement; design and content. 
(a)  Stop signs shall be erected as directed by the village board, including, but not limited to, at entrances to through streets designated in this chapter. 
(b)  Every stop sign shall be located as near as practicable to the nearest line of the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, then as close as practicable to the nearest line of the intersecting street. 
(c)  Every stop sign erected shall bear the word "stop" in letters not less than six inches in height, except at intersections where flashing light signals are used, in which case the letters, if used, shall not be less than four inches in height.

(c)  Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter upon the use of land or buildings or upon the bulk of buildings are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this chapter or of any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) shall govern. 
(d)  This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant, or any other private agreement provided that where such regulations of this chapter are more restrictive (or impose higher standards or requirements) than such easements, covenants, or other private agreements, the requirements of this chapter shall prevail. 
(e)  No building, structure, or use which was not lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall become or be made lawful solely by reason of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived; and, to the extent that, and in any manner that, said unlawful building, structure or use is in conflict with the requirements of this chapter, said building, structure, or use remains unlawful hereunder.

Sec. 62-4. - Separability. 
The several provisions of this chapter shall be severable in accordance with the following rules: 
(1)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall judge any provision of this chapter to be invalid, such adjudication shall not affect any other provisions in this chapter. 
(2)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the application of any provision of this chapter only to a particular parcel of land, a particular structure, or a particular use, than such judgment shall not affect the application of said provisions to any other land, structure or use. 
(3)  Should any court of competent jurisdiction declare the provisions of this chapter invalid in their application to a particular parcel of land, the zoning map shall continue to show such parcel in the zoning district applicable to it pursuant to this chapter unless and until such district is changed by an amendment adopted by the board of trustees in the manner normally applied to amendments of districts; however, the parcel in question shall be identified with a distinctive marking to direct attention to the court decree affecting said parcel. Any such court decree shall be filed with any other amendments or village board approved changes to the zoning map as heretofore outlined in the procedure governing the annual revision of the official zoning map. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.02)  
Sec. 62-5. - Scope of regulations. 
All buildings erected hereafter, all uses of land or buildings established hereafter, all structural alterations or relocation of existing buildings occurring hereafter, and all enlargements of or additions to existing uses occurring hereafter shall be subject to all regulations of this chapter which are applicable to the zoning districts in which such buildings, uses or land shall be located. 
(1)  However, where a building permit for a building, structure or use has been issued in accordance with law prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and provided that construction is begun within 90 days of permit issuance, said building or structure may be completed in accordance with the approved plans on the basis of which the building permit has been issued, and further, may, upon completion, be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use of which originally designated.

It is the intent of this chapter that the entire area of the village, including all land and water areas, be included in the districts established by this chapter. Any area lying within the village but not shown on the zoning map as being included in such a district shall be deemed to be, and it is hereby classified in the S-1 Special District. 
(Code 1964, § 30-4.03)  
Sec. 62-9. - Zoning districts. 
(a)  In order to carry out the purposes and provisions of this chapter, the village is hereby divided into the following districts:

(Code 1964, § 30-4.01)  
Sec. 62-10. - District boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  The district boundaries are the centerlines of highways, streets, alleys, waterways, and other rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated, or to the centerline of railroad right-of-way providing main line service and existing on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. When the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map coincides with the location of any such right-of-way line, the centerline of such right-of-way shall be construed as to be the boundary of such district. Where a street right-of-way abuts a railroad right-of-way, the district boundary line shall coincide with the centerline of the railroad right-of-way providing main line service and existing on the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
(2)  When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line representing a legally platted subdivision and in existence at the time of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, such lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of such district. The act of acquisition of one or more tracts of land or lots of record and maintained under a single fee title and containing more than one zoning district classification does not entitle any zoning other than contained in the zoning map. 
(3)  When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the centerline of any right-of-way or lot line, the district boundary shall be determined by use of the scale shown on the zoning map. 
(4)  Whenever any street, alley or other public right-of-way is vacated by official action of village board, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public right-of-way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation, and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district. 
(Code 1964, § 30-4.04)  
Sec. 62-11. - Residential use in other than residential district. 
No residential building shall be erected in or alteration made to any existing structure increasing the number of any dwelling units in any manufacturing district. Further, no building shall be erected or alteration made to any existing structure permitting the establishment of new residential uses on a ground floor, nor alteration made to any existing structure increasing the number of existing dwelling units on a ground floor in any commercial or special district, except that a planned development meeting the requirements of this chapter may be offered for review and approval allowing such use consideration; or, in those commercial districts allowing residential use as a special use, such use may be offered for consideration providing the requirements of this chapter are met regarding special use permits; or, where such uses as hotels, motels or bed and breakfast accommodations are permitted within the specific commercial zoning district. Unless otherwise provided, all regulations applicable to such buildings having residential uses in any manufacturing, commercial or special district shall be those as applied to the B Multiple-Family Residential District. Those regulations shall be applicable to existing or legally permitted or expanded buildings and shall include bulk requirements, yard requirements and off-street parking regulations without variation. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.04)  
Sec. 62-12. - Minimum residential lot size. 
The minimum zoning lot allowed for residential building purposes shall have a width and street frontage of not less than 50 feet and contain not less than 6,200 square feet in area. For the purpose of this chapter, zoning lots less than 50 feet in width and/or containing less than 6,200 square feet in area shall be deemed substandard. Use of a zoning lot with less than said frontage or area for residential building purposes may be authorized as specifically allowed in section 62-73, or by authorization of the president and board of trustees of the village after the receipt of the report and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, in the manner and form prescribed by this chapter after it has been determined that such lot was of public record on or before November 19, 1924; that ownership of the lot by the petitioner was of public record on or before November 19, 1924; and that at that time the owner did not own sufficient adjacent property which would have established a legal zoning lot meeting minimum requirements; and that said lot cannot reasonably be enlarged by acquisition of adjoining land or cannot reasonably be disposed of to the owners of adjoining land. Such authorization may be made only after the denial of a permit, proper taking of appeal and holding of a public hearing; all in conformity with the requirements of the state revised statutes and this chapter. Consideration shall be given in each case to an authoritative ownership record of the lots involved and adjoining since November 19, 1924.

(Code 1964, § 30-5.06; Ord. No. 2007-26, § 2, 3-26-2007)  
Sec. 62-14. - Setbacks and yard determinations; triangular/wedge-shaped lots. 
(a)  The leg of any triangular or wedge-shaped lot generally running parallel to an improved public thoroughfare shall be deemed to be the front lot line and any minimum front yard setback shall be measured from that lot line. The leg of the triangle or wedge-shaped lot attached to the front lot line and forming an angle of less than 60 degrees shall be deemed to be the rear lot line and any minimum rear setback shall be measured from that lot line. The remaining leg of a triangular lot or the remaining sides of a wedged-shape lot shall be considered side lot lines and any side yard requirements shall be measured from and be parallel to such lines. All such yard requirements shall be the minimum yard requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
(b)  For triangular and wedge-shaped lots having legs on two of their sides abutting an intersecting improved public thoroughfares, the property owner shall choose one thoroughfare as being the lot front and the leg paralleling the other thoroughfare shall be deemed the rear lot line, except those lots which abut Grand Boulevard, the side paralleling Grant Boulevard shall be declared to be the lot front. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.07)

Sec. 62-16. - Garages and accessory storage structures. 
These regulations shall be applicable to all private garages and accessory storage structures. All such private garages and accessory storage structures are to be subordinate to all principal use structures and for residentially used properties shall contribute to the comfort, convenience or necessity of the occupants inhabiting the principal use structure. However, as applied to residential private garages, these regulations are not intended to prohibit the use of any garage by a nonresident third-party, providing that the remaining off-street parking is both sufficient in quantity and design as required elsewhere within this chapter. All measurements for the determination of heights of garages and accessory storage structures shall be made from the finished grade elevation to the top of the ridge or parapet. No detached garage or accessory structure shall be located between the front yard building setback line and the principal residential structure in any residential zoning district. No garage may be constructed so as to reduce the total number of parking spaces required by this chapter. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.09)  
Sec. 62-17. - Garages. 
(a)  Attached accessory buildings or structures. Attached accessory buildings or structures are considered a part of the principal building or structure for the purposes of determining height, bulk, and yard restrictions set forth in this Code. Garages/carports are limited to one attached garage or one detached garage per zoning lot in any single-family residential district. The primary garage door providing driveway or ramp entry must be accessible via an approved surface approach from a street or alley. All garages must be architecturally harmonious with the principal use structure. 
(b)  Detached accessory buildings or structures. 
(1)  Detached accessory buildings or structures as defined by this Code include, but are not limited to: garages or carports, gazebos, sheds or other outside storage, workshop or office space, outdoor kitchens, or any other covered or enclosed permanent structure intended for an accessory use. Each zoning lot is limited to one detached accessory structure, not including a garage. No detached accessory building or structure may be used for dwelling purposes.

(2)  Height, yard and bulk requirements for detached garages. 
a.  Height. The height for detached garages shall be measured as building height is defined by this Code. In residential districts, detached garages may not exceed a height of 14 feet. For all commercial districts where such garage shall not be the principal use, no garage shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed one story or 16 feet in height. For all industrial and special districts, no garage shall hereafter be erected or altered to exceed two stories or 24 feet in height. 
b.  Yard. Detached garages may not be located at any point between the front property line and the current front yard setback line or the existing front building line, whichever is greater. Detached garages may not be located within five feet of a corner side property line or three feet from an interior side or rear property line.

No part of a public street or alley shall be included in any such width, square footage, setback or yard. No lot or group of lots under the same ownership used wholly or partly for residential building purposes shall be diminished or further diminished in width, depth or area so as to leave any dwelling then standing or thereafter constructed thereon with a lot of less width, frontage, setback, yard or area as here before stated. Use of a lot with less than said width street frontage, setback, yard, or area for residential building purposes may be authorized only by the village president and board of trustees upon the report and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, after the denial of a permit, proper taking of appeal and holding of a public hearing, notice of which shall meet the requirements of the state compiled statutes and this chapter and after it has been determined that such lot was of public record on November 19, 1924, and that said lot cannot be reasonably enlarged by acquisition of adjoining land or cannot be reasonably disposed of to adjoining lands. Consideration shall be given in each case to an authoritative ownership record of lots involved and adjoining since November 19, 1924. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.10; Ord. No. 99-24, 7-26-1999; Ord. No. 99-51, 12-13-1999; Ord. No. 2013-69, § 21, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 62-20. - Essential services. 
All municipal services and services provided by any public utility which are deemed to be essential by action of the village board at a regular village board meeting shall be permitted in any zoning district. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.11; Ord. No. 94-14, 3-25-1974)  
Sec. 62-21. - Consolidation of zoning lots. 
(a)  No person shall use two or more contiguous subdivided lots or portions thereof to satisfy the requirements of this chapter unless said person shall duly record with the county recorder of deeds a plat conforming to the applicable state statutes and the requirements of this Code consolidating or subdividing the lots as the proper case may be. 
(b)  No person shall build or extend any building or structure on two or more contiguous subdivided lots or portions thereof unless said person shall duly record with the county recorder of deeds a plat conforming to the applicable state statutes and the requirements of this Code consolidating or subdividing the lots as the proper case may be. 
(Code 1964, § 30-5.12; Ord. No. 99-24, 7-26-1999; Ord. No. 99-51, 12-13-1999; Ord. No. 2007-26, § 2, 3-26-2007)  
Sec. 62-22. - Use classifications generally. 
This section establishes and describes the use classification system used to classify principal uses in this zoning ordinance. 
(a)  Use categories. This zoning ordinance classifies principal land uses into eight major groupings (described in sections 62-23 through 62-30). These major groupings are referred to as "use categories." The use categories are as follows: 
(1)  Residential (see section 62-23). 
(2)  Public, civic and institutional (see section 62-24). 
(3)  Commercial (see section 62-25). 
(4)  Wholesale, distribution and storage (see section 62-26). 
(5)  Industrial (see section 62-27). 
(6)  Recycling (see section 62-28). 
(7)  Agricultural (see section 62-29). 
(8)  Other (see section 62-30). 
(b)  Use subcategories. Each use category is further divided into more narrowly defined "subcategories." Use subcategories classify principal land uses and activities based on common functional, product or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, and how goods or services are sold or delivered and site conditions. 
(c)  Specific use types. Some use subcategories are further broken down to identify specific types of uses that are regulated differently than the subcategory as a whole. 
(d)  Determination of use categories and subcategories. 
(1)  The village manager is authorized to classify uses on the basis of the use category, subcategory and specific use type descriptions of this zoning ordinance. 
(2)  When a use cannot be reasonably classified into a use category, subcategory or specific use type, or appears to fit into multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the village manager is authorized to determine the most similar and thus most appropriate use category, subcategory or specific use type based on the actual or projected characteristics of the principal use or activity in relationship to the use category, subcategory and specific use type descriptions provided in this chapter. In making such determinations, the village manager must consider: 
a.  The types of activities that will occur in conjunction with the use; 
b.  The types of equipment and processes to be used; 
c.  The existence, number and frequency of residents, customers or employees; 
d.  Parking demands associated with the use; and 
e.  Other factors deemed relevant to a use determination. 
If a use can reasonably be classified in multiple categories, subcategories or specific use types, the development administrator or land use administrator is authorized to categorize each use in the category, subcategory or specific use type that provides the most exact, narrowest and appropriate "fit." 
(Ord. No. 2017-9 , § 4.A., 1-9-2017)  
Sec. 62-23. - Residential use category. 
This category includes uses that provide living accommodations for one or more persons. The residential use subcategories are as follows: 
(a)  Household living. Residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a household. When dwelling units are rented, tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential; they are considered a form of lodging. 
(1)  Single-family detached. Occupancy of a lot solely by a single dwelling unit that is used as a residence for one family. Single-family detached dwelling units are not attached to any other dwelling unit. 
(2)  Single-family attached. Occupancy of a lot solely by a single dwelling unit that is used as a residence for one family. Single-family attached dwelling units are attached to at least one other dwelling unit, which is located on a separate lot. 
(3)  Two-family. The use of a lot solely as a residence for two families with each family occupying a single dwelling unit. The dwelling units are attached horizontally (wall to wall) or vertically (floor to ceiling). 
(4)  Multi-family. The use of a lot solely as a residence for three or more families with each family occupying a single dwelling unit. The dwelling units are attached horizontally (wall to wall) or vertically (floor to ceiling). 
(5)  Mixed-use. A building in residential dwelling units occupy only one or more of the upper floors, with nonresidential uses occupying the ground floor. 
(b)  Group living. Residential occupancy of a building or any portion of a building by a group other than a household. Group living uses typically provide communal kitchen/dining facilities. Examples of group living uses include community residences, convents, monasteries, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, sheltered care facilities, retirement centers, and halfway houses.

Temporary storage containers shall not be located on any public street unless the location is approved by the village manager in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
(b)  Temporary storage containers are permitted to be located on private property or, where it is not possible to locate the temporary storage container on private property, upon the approval of the location by the village manager, on the area of a public street used for the parking of motor vehicles in residential, business and industrial zoning districts provided that the temporary storage container complies with the requirements of this section and a permit for the temporary storage container has been issued by the zoning enforcement administrator or the village manager and remains valid. 
(c)  An application for a permit requesting the location of a temporary storage container on private property or, where it is not possible to locate the temporary storage container on private property, on the area of a public street used for the parking of motor vehicles, along with the required permit fee, shall be filed with the zoning enforcement administrator by the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the property where the temporary storage container is proposed to be located. The zoning enforcement administrator shall review the permit application. If the application discloses that the temporary storage container is to be located on private property and complies with the requirements of this chapter, the zoning enforcement administrator shall issue the permit to the applicant. If the application discloses that the temporary storage container is proposed to be located on a public street and complies with the requirements of this chapter, the zoning enforcement administrator shall forward the application for consideration of approval by the village manager. In such case, the village manager shall review the permit application. If the application discloses that the temporary storage container to be located on a public street complies with the requirements of this section, the village manager shall issue the permit to the applicant. 
(d)  The fee for a permit for a temporary storage container shall be as provided in the fee schedule. 
(e)  Temporary storage containers are subject to compliance with the following: 
(1)  Temporary storage containers shall be located on private property as follows: 
a.  There shall be not more than one temporary storage container located upon a lot at any time; 
b.  The lot on which the temporary storage container is located shall be occupied by a principal building; 
c.  The temporary storage container shall be located at least three feet from any lot line; 
d.  The temporary storage container shall be located in the rear or side yard of the lot, except that the temporary storage container may be located in the front yard, only when the zoning enforcement administrator determines, in writing, that the application sets forth circumstances that disclose that a side or rear yard location is not practical and where the temporary storage container is sited entirely on a driveway or other improved surface. 
(2)  Temporary storage containers shall be located on a public street as follows: 
a.  The application of the property owner sets forth facts that demonstrate it is not possible to locate the temporary storage container on private property; and the Village Manager, upon review of the application, determines that it is not possible to locate the temporary storage container on private property. 
b.  There shall be not more than one temporary storage container located upon a public street adjacent to the property owner's lot at any time. 
c.  The area on a public street on which the temporary storage container is located shall be adjacent to the lot on which the property owner's building is located. 
d.  The temporary storage container shall not be located on any public street at a location that obstructs travel upon the street by motor vehicles, pedestrians or bicycles. 
e.  Temporary storage containers shall not be located on any public street at a location within 15 feet of the intersection of any street or public alley. 
f.  When a temporary storage container is to be located on a public street, it is the responsibility of the permit applicant to place a flashing barricade on either side of the temporary storage container; and, where there is parking on the opposite side of the street, it is the responsibility of the permit applicant to place a flashing barricade in the street parking areas on the side opposite to where the temporary storage container is to be placed to ensure that there is adequate space for vehicular passage. 
g.  The temporary storage container permit applicant is responsible for any damage to the public right-of-way. The applicant will be notified of the cost of repair, based on the current cost assessed by the department of public works. Failure to pay the fine within 30 days will result in a $750.00 fine.

No temporary storage container for which a permit has been issued to locate the temporary storage container on a public street or to locate the temporary storage container on private property that is not in conjunction with a project for which a building permit has been issued by the village shall remain on private property for more than ten consecutive days, unless the permit is extended by renewal thereof. A permit for a temporary storage container may be renewed by the zoning enforcement administrator upon the payment of a renewal fee and the filing of an application for renewal for one additional period of up to 30 days when the permit has been issued in conjunction with a project for which a building permit has been issued by the village and the temporary storage container is located on private property or for one additional period of up to ten days when the permit has been issued for the temporary storage container to be located on a public street or on private property in conjunction with a project for which a building permit has not been issued by the village. After the initial renewal period, a permit for a temporary storage container may be renewed by the Village Manager upon the payment of a renewal fee and the filing of an application setting forth circumstances beyond the control of the owner or occupant of the property justifying the renewal for additional periods of up to 30 days when the permit has been issued in conjunction with a project for which a building permit has been issued by the village and the temporary storage container is located on private property or for additional periods of up to ten days when the permit has been issued for the temporary storage container to be located on a public street or when the permit has not been issued in conjunction with a project for which a building permit has not been issued by the village. 
(4)  Temporary storage containers shall not exceed eight feet in height, eight feet in width and 16 feet in length.

A home occupation shall not occupy more than 25 percent of the floor area and shall not exceed 400 square feet in area, whichever is less, and shall not change the outside appearance of the building from that of a residential dwelling. The use of a garage facility is not permitted where such use reduces or eliminates the required number of off-street parking spaces as specified within this chapter.

(b)  Exceptions and explanatory footnotes for this division: 
(1)  Where zoning lots have already been developed with a single-family residential dwelling on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and a request for removal and replacement of the residential structure is made to the village, a permit allowing such replacement shall be authorized providing that the proposed construction is in conformity with all provisions of all village codes and ordinances, including the provisions of this chapter, except as follows: In the A-2 Single-Family District, one single-family residence may be constructed on any zoning lot legally existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and containing a minimum width of 45 feet and a minimum lot area of 5,625 square feet; in the A-3 Single-Family District, one single-family residence may be constructed on an interior zoning lot containing a minimum width of 44 feet and a minimum lot area of 5,500 square feet; provided that in all such cases, all height, yard and coverage requirements established by this chapter are met. 
(2)  In a planned residential development where housing types are mixed, the square footage of the site, providing the minimum total square footage required has been met, shall be the cumulative square foot total of all unit minimums applied to each of the respective types of dwelling units then multiplied by the total number of dwelling units for that type of dwelling unit. In a mixed commercial/residential planned development, the minimum square footage of the site shall be the minimum site required for the commercial site plus the minimum of 25,000 square feet or the square footage required by the cumulative total of the housing type multiplied by the respective number of dwelling units. However, in a mixed commercial/residential planned development where all residential units are to be located above the first floor, the minimum or first 25,000 square feet of the residential requirements may be waived. Nothing in this subsection is intended to preclude consideration of any residentially zoned property from being included within a planned development which is wholly commercial in nature, provided that the minimum property size required in the commercial district has been first met.

Such planned developments shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  In all cases, the planned development must be served by municipal water and sewer service and shall have an adequate point or points of access, as determined by the village, to public thoroughfares, so as to avoid unnecessary hazards or undue traffic congestion, as well as providing for stormwater management meeting the village and the Chicago Metropolitan Water Reclamation District's standards.

DIVISION 6. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS OVERLAY DISTRICT

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that tend to have an adverse impact on the surrounding community. Further, there are presently insufficient mechanisms in the village to regulate the location of sexually oriented businesses to minimize the adverse impact on surrounding property owners. 
(2)  Certain employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Unlawful sexual acts occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows and generally results in an increase in crime with the village. 
(4)  Offering and providing such unregulated locations encourages such activities, which has an adverse impact on the village's retail trade, property values of surrounding properties which results in a reduction in the quality of the village's neighborhoods, commercial districts and suburban life. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within or about the premises of such sexually oriented businesses, or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs. 
(6)  Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in or about sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydia, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis and chancroid. 
(7)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and, in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(8)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films. 
(9)  The presence of sexually oriented businesses can have an adverse effect on residential neighborhoods, neighborhood children and community improvement efforts. 
(10)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (9) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(11)  Sexually oriented businesses have characteristics that tend to have secondary adverse effects on surrounding property and should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(12)  Zoning is an appropriate mechanism to minimize the impact of sexually oriented businesses and provide a reasonable alternate avenue of communication for sexually oriented businesses. Further, zoning permits sexually oriented businesses to be located in areas consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the community and citizens of the village. It is appropriate to require reasonable limitations on the location of sexually oriented businesses. 
(13)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

(2)  Ground story and upper stories, minimum and maximum height. (Refer to Figure 62-216-29. measuring stories with floor-to-floor height). 
a.  Minimum overall height. Minimum heights require a minimum number of stories on the primary frontage facades of the building. The building must meet the minimum required height for the first 30 feet of occupied building space measured from the primary frontage facade into the building. 
b.  Maximum overall height. Maximum heights are specified both in number of stories and overall dimension. This requirement applies to the entire building. 
1.  Towers. Where noted, towers may exceed the overall maximum height per 62-216(h), cap types. 
2.  Cap type. Where noted, certain cap types may allow additional height. 
c.  Two half stories. Refer to 62-215(g) for definition of a half story. A building incorporating both a half story within the roof and a visible basement shall count the height of the two half stories as one full story. 
(3)  Minimum and maximum height per story. Each story is measured with a range of permitted floor-to-floor heights. Refer to Figure 62-216-29. measuring stories with floor-to-floor height. 
a.  Measurement. Floor height is measured in feet between the floor of a story to the floor of the story above it. Minimum and maximum floor-to-floor heights are required to be met on floors along facades, a minimum of 80 percent of each story. 
b.  Single story buildings and top floor measurement. For single story buildings and the uppermost story of a multiple story building, floor-to-floor height shall be one foot less than noted per building type and measured from the floor of the story to the ceiling. 
c.  Mezzanines. Mezzanines may be included within the floor-to-floor height of any story, included in the calculation of stories. Mezzanines occupying more than 30 percent of the floor area below and extending above the story's allowable floor-to-floor height shall count as an additional story, including articulation of the story per section 62-217(d), building articulation. 
d.  Taller spaces. Spaces exceeding the allowable floor-to-floor heights of the building are not permitted on primary frontage facades. These spaces are unlimited on interior lots and non-primary frontage facades, but shall be counted as the number of stories that would fit within their height. 
 
4.  Minimum required transparency. Per the requirements of each building type, a minimum amount of transparency is required on all stories of all facades. 
a.  Measurement. Minimum facade transparency is measured from floor-to-floor of each story separately. Refer to Figure 62-216-30. measuring minimum facade transparency. Transparency, defined in 62-215(g), definitions, includes windows and any glass in doors that is highly transparent with low reflectance. The measurement may include the frame, mullions, and muntins, but shall not include trim or casing. 
b.  Blank wall segments. No more than a 15-foot wide section, measured horizontally, and no more than 30 percent of any story shall be without transparency. 
i.  Exception. When a facade of any story is located within three feet of a parallel building facade, no minimum transparency is required for that story. 
c.  Minimum ground story transparency. When required by the building type, ground story transparency shall be measured between two feet and either eight or ten feet, as noted, from the average grade at the base of the facade. Minimum ground story transparency supersedes the overall minimum transparency required for the building type. 
d.  Tall stories. Stories that are 18 feet or taller in height shall be counted as two stories for the purpose of calculating minimum facade transparency, with each horizontal half of the story calculated separately. 
e.  Half stories. All half stories located within roof structure and visible basements are required to meet the minimum transparency. 
 
(h)  Cap types. The major components of any roof shall meet the requirements of one of the cap types permitted per building type. Roofs for bay or bow windows and dormers are not required to meet a cap type. 
(1)  Other cap types. Special cap designs otherwise not defined in this section may be approved through an minor design exception during the design review process with the following requirements: 
a.  The building shall warrant a separate status from the majority of buildings in the district, with a correspondence between the form of the cap and the building use, such as a dome for a planetarium, a dome for a place of worship, or a unique, singular roof for a more distinctive city hall. 
b.  The cap type shall not create additional occupiable space beyond that permitted by the building type. 
c.  The shape of the roof shall be different from those defined in this section 62-216(h), cap types, such as a dome, spire, or vault, and not a gabled roof, hipped roof, butterfly roof, gambrel roof, mansard roof, roof with parapet, or flat roof. 
(2)  Pitched cap type. (Refer to Figure 62-216-31. examples of pitched cap type). This cap type is a sloped or pitched roof. Slope is measured with the vertical rise divided by the horizontal span or run. 
a.  Pitch measure. The roof may not be sloped less than a 4:12 (rise:run) or more than 14:12. Slopes less than 4:12 are permitted to occur on second story or higher roofs. 
b.  Configurations. 
1.  Hipped, gabled, and combination of hips and gables with or without dormers are permitted. 
2.  Butterfly (inverted gable roof) and shed roofs are permitted with a maximum height of eight feet, inclusive of overhang. 
3.  Gambrel and mansard roofs are not permitted. 
c.  Parallel ridge line. A gabled end or perpendicular ridge line shall occur at least every 100 feet of roof when the ridge line runs parallel to the front lot line. (Refer to Figure 62-216-31. examples of pitched cap type). 
d.  Roof height. Roofs without occupied building space and/or dormers shall have a maximum height on primary and non-primary frontage facades equal to no more than one and one-half times the upper story floor to floor height utilized on the building. 
e.  Occupied building space. Occupied building space may be incorporated behind this cap type. If used, the space counts as a half story. 
f.  Rooftop appurtenances. With the exception of solar panels, any rooftop appurtenances shall be recessed within the pitched roof with no visibility on any street elevation drawing. 
 
(3)  Parapet cap type. (Refer to Figure 62-216-32. example of a parapet cap type). A parapet is a low wall projecting above a building's roof along the perimeter of the building. 
a.  Parapet height. Height is measured from the top of the upper story to the top of the parapet. Minimum height is 2 feet with a maximum height of six feet. Horizontal expression lines. An expression line shall define the parapet from the upper stories of the building and shall also define the top of the cap. Refer to section 62-215(g), definitions for expression line. 
b.  Occupied building space. Occupied building space shall not be incorporated behind this cap type.

Sec. 62-220. - Procedure. 
An application for a building permit for a new or enlarged building, structure or use shall include herewith, a plot plan, drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, showing any and all parking and loading facilities to be provided in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Code 1964, § 30-7.01(A); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 2000-28; Ord. No. 2000-29; Ord. No. 2000-30, 4-24-2000)  
Sec. 62-221. - Extent of control. 
All buildings, structures and land uses and all modifications of existing buildings, structures or land use initiated after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, shall be provided with accessory off-street parking and loading as required herein. A building or structure for which a permit has been issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall comply with the requirements in effect at the time of the issuance of the permit. 
(Code 1964, § 30-7.01(B); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 2000-28; Ord. No. 2000-29; Ord. No. 2000-30, 4-24-2000)  
Sec. 62-222. - Existing parking and loading spaces. 
Accessory off-street parking and loading spaces in existence on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may not be reduced in number, except in compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(Code 1964, § 30-7.01(D); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 2000-28; Ord. No. 2000-29; Ord. No. 2000-30, 4-24-2000)  
Sec. 62-223. - Permissive parking spaces. 
Nothing in this article shall prevent the establishment of off-street automobile parking facilities to serve any legally established use of land or buildings, subject to the provisions of this article. Principal uses located in SA districts or in C-1 or C-2 district may share off-street parking areas with other principal uses located in SA districts or in C-1 or C-2 districts. Such shared off-street parking areas may be located outside of SA, C-1 or C-2 district. In districts other than SA, C-1 or C-2 districts, off-street parking areas not contained on the same zoning lot as the principal use must be located in the same zoning district in which the principal use is located. In districts other than the C-1 and C-2 districts, if such remote off-street parking facilities are intended to be located in another zoning district, different from that of the principal structure or use, then a special use permit must be sought before any such use can be established and recognized as fulfilling the requirements for off-street parking established by this chapter. Special use permit approval is not required if the district in which the off-street parking facilities are to be located permits public parking garages or public parking lots. 
(Code 1964, § 30-7.01(D); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 2000-28; Ord. No. 2000-29; Ord. No. 2000-30, 4-24-2000; Ord. No. 2017-9 , § 4.E., 1-9-2017)  
Sec. 62-224. - Joint parking facilities. 
Joint or "shared" parking refers to the practice of two or more users who have need for parking at different times voluntarily agreeing to make use of some of all the same parking spaces. Joint parking is encouraged as a means of conserving scarce land resources, reducing stormwater runoff. reducing the heat island effect caused by large paved areas and improving village appearance. Special use permit approval is required for approval of joint parking arrangements. Special use permit for joint off-street parking and/or loading facilities may be approved if the applicant demonstrates to the village's satisfaction that such combination of buildings, structures and/or use is of such a unique nature that the cumulative number of parking and/or loading spaces can be reduced. However, the granting of such a special use permit will require proof from the petitioner that no increased congestion in the public streets nor any other violation of the intent and purpose of this chapter will occur. The village may establish criteria and stipulations with the granting of any such special use permit to provide safeguards from building, structure or use changes which will create congestion upon the public streets or otherwise measurably degrade the health, safety, or the general welfare of the public. Such safeguards may include, but are not limited to, the holding of vacant land in retention for future parking space needs, voiding licenses for business operation in the village, establishment of a performance bond, or other such action. The burden of proof showing that a reduction in the number of parking and/or loading spaces as required by this chapter is solely the responsibility of the petitioner. Each such request shall be reviewed in light of its own merits. 
(Code 1964, § 30-7.01(E); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 2000-28; Ord. No. 2000-29; Ord. No. 2000-30, 4-24-2000; Ord. No. 2017-9 , § 4.F., 1-9-2017)  
Sec. 62-225. - Control of off-street facilities. 
When required accessory off-street parking facilities are provided elsewhere than on the lot other than on which the principal building, structure or use is located, those parking facilities shall be in the same possession, either by deed or long-term lease, as the property occupied by such principal building, structure, or use. Any such off-site/remote parking facilities must be located within 1,000 feet of the main entrance of the principal building, structure or use being served, and, except for the C-1, C-2, C-3 and SA districts, must be in the same block as that no public street lies between the off-street parking spaces and the principal building, structure or use being served. The owner shall be bound by covenants filed of record in the office of the county recorder of deeds, requiring the owner and his heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of parking spaces during the existence of the use of the principal building or structure.

Subdivision III. - Requirements 
 
Sec. 62-289. - General rules. 
(a)  Whenever a legal use existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived is changed thereafter to a new use, parking facilities for the new use shall be provided as required herein for the number of parking spaces needed in excess of the number of spaces which would have been required under the terms of this chapter for the prior use or degree of prior existence. However, no use may be so expanded as to reduce the total minimum number of parking spaces required by this chapter. Any new structure or any structure renovated or remodeled creating an increase in the exterior bulk to accommodate additional floor area shall provide the number of parking spaces required herein for the new structure, or that portion of the structure so enlarged. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this subsection, no building or use lawfully existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be required to provide any additional parking spaces pursuant to the foregoing subsection, unless and until the aggregate increase in units of measurement shall equal ten percent or more of the units of measurement existing upon such effective date, in which parking spaces shall be provided for the total aggregate increase. 
(c)  When determination of the number of required parking spaces results in the requirement of any fractional parking space, any such fraction shall require one additional parking space, unless the total number of additional parking spaces is less than one, where the applicant shall be absolved of providing such a singular parking space. 
(d)  In stadiums, auditoriums, houses of worship, and other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy bench-type or similar seating, each 22 inches of such seating shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirements for off-street parking under this chapter. 
(e)  When parking spaces are required on the basis of the number of employees, customers, students or similar population measure, the maximum number for which the structure is designed shall govern, except that when the structure has no design capacity, the maximum number present at any time shall govern. 
(f)  The determination of floor area per unit of measurement shall be determined on a square footage basis and shall mean each square footage of usable area exclusive of storage area, mechanical equipment rooms, stairwells, restrooms, hallways, lobbies not used for reception, and other areas not normally occupied by either employees or customers, and exclusive of other facilities for which separate parking requirements are established, unless otherwise stated herein and as applicable to a specific use. 
(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the continued utilization of any parking space as an accessory use to any structure or use for parking of a vehicle that may be lawfully parked in such a space solely because such space does not satisfy the location or design requirements of this chapter, if such space was validly in use as an accessory use to such structure or use on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and if the forced abandonment of such space shall reduce the total number of parking spaces required by this chapter. 
(h)  In all residential zoning districts or in any other zoning district where off-street parking area or garage is used for residential purposes, no off-street parking area or garage parking space which is required to meet the minimum off-street parking requirements of this chapter shall be used for other than the temporary storage of motor vehicles related to the premises.

Sec. 62-291. - Parking credits and reductions. 
(a)  Motorcycle and scooter parking. In parking lots containing more than ten parking spaces, the provision of motorcycle or scooter parking spaces may be credited toward satisfying the minimum off-street parking requirements of section 62-290 at the rate of one motor vehicle parking space for each two motorcycle or scooter parking spaces. The maximum credit allowed under this provision is two spaces or ten percent of the total minimum motor vehicle parking requirement for the subject property whichever is greater. To receive credit, each motorcycle and scooter space must have a concrete surface and minimum dimensions of four feet by eight feet. This provision applies to existing and proposed parking lots. 
(b)  Car-share and bike-share service. The following parking credits apply to nonresidential uses that are required to provide ten or more motor vehicle parking spaces and to residential or mixed-use projects that are required to provide 20 or more motor vehicle parking spaces. 
(1)  The number of required motor vehicle parking spaces is reduced by four spaces for each parking space that is leased by a village-approved car-share program for use by a car-share vehicle. 
(2)  The number of required motor vehicle parking spaces is reduced by two spaces for uses that provide space for a village-approved bike-share program facility with a minimum of ten bicycle parking docks. 
(c)  Long-term bicycle parking. Each six long-term bicycle parking spaces is credited as one motor vehicle space. 
(1)  Long-term bicycle parking spaces provided to receive parking credit must be provided in the building or in a weather-protected area. Long-term bicycle parking spaces must be protected from access by unauthorized persons. 
(2)  Long-term bicycle parking spaces provided to receive parking credit must: 
a.  Consist of bike racks or lockers anchored so that they cannot be easily removed; 
b.  Allow both the bicycle frame and the wheels to be locked with the bicycle in an upright position using a standard U-lock; 
c.  Be designed so as not to cause damage to the bicycle; 
d.  Facilitate easy locking without interference from or to adjacent bicycles; and 
e.  Have minimum dimensions of two feet in width by six feet in length, with a minimum overhead vertical clearance of seven feet. Bicycle lockers are exempt from overhead clearance requirements.

(1)  The nearest pedestrian entrance to the public parking lot or garage must be located within 1,000 feet of the lot on which the subject use is located; 
(2)  The parking facility must be open to the general public from at least 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.; 
(3)  Minimum parking requirements may be reduced by one parking space for every four parking spaces within the public parking lot or garage, not to exceed a total reduction of more than 25 spaces. 
(e)  On-street parking. Nonresidential uses may count on-street parking spaces on public street rights-of- way abutting the subject property towards satisfying off-street motor vehicle parking requirements. One on-street parking space credit may be taken for each 20 linear feet of abutting right-of-way where on-street parking is allowed. Only space on the same side of the street as the subject use may be counted, except that the opposite side of the street may be counted if the property on that side of the street does not have the potential for future development. In calculating credit for on-street parking, all fractional spaces are rounded down.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 62-344. - General. 
(a)  Any lawful use of land or structure, or any lawful structure located in a zoning district in which such use or structure exists on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, and whose use would be prohibited by the terms of this chapter, or whose bulk exceeds maximum dimensions established by the terms of this chapter, is declared to be a legal nonconforming use. 
(b)  This chapter permits these legal nonconformances to continue until terminated by; voluntary act, by catastrophic event, 50 percent or more of the structure is altered or destroyed, or as otherwise provided herein. It is the intent of this chapter to encourage a conforming use where possible. 
(c)  The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to guide the future use of land within the village by encouraging the development or maintenance of desirable residential, business, office, and industrial areas within appropriate groupings and related uses and thereby promote and protect the public health, safety, general welfare and value of property located within the village. 
(d)  The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is lawful existing under the provisions of this chapter shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such nonconformity and not the village. 
(e)  No accessory building or structure which has an assessed valuation of less than $5,000.00 on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, no accessory use which is nonconforming, may continue to exist after the nonconforming primary building, structure or use ceases to legally exist under the terms of this article. 
(f)  The period of time in the determination of a discontinuance of a legal conforming use existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter shall not include any discontinuance caused by government actions, strikes, material shortages, or acts of God, unless by contributing fault of the entity maintaining the claim of the nonconforming use. 
(Code 1964, § 30-8(A))  
Sec. 62-345. - Scope. 
Separate restrictions are established for: nonconforming uses of land, nonconforming uses of structures, nonconforming structures, and nonconforming lots.

Sec. 62-451. - Residential exceptions for extensions, expansions, enlargements, intensity. 
Within any residential zoning district, a nonconforming single-family detached dwelling may be so expanded or enlarged so as to allow for an increase in the habitable area of the dwelling, provided that no increase in the extent of the nonconformity occurs, except as specifically provided hereinbelow, and further provided that any such enlargement or addition conforms to all bulk, height, yard and land coverage requirements for the zoning district in which it is located. A building addition to an existing nonconforming structure that projects further horizontally into a required setback or further vertically above the maximum height is an example of an increase in the extent of the nonconformity. Notwithstanding this requirement, a single-family residential structure can be expanded vertically within the height regulations of this chapter without a zoning variation, provided there is no nonconforming expansion of the footprint of the structure, no horizontal expansion of living space beyond the existing footprint of the structure, and the proposed drip line for the residential structure is not extended beyond the existing drip line of the residential structure. However, in no case shall such expansion or enlargement create an increase in the number of dwelling units within the primary building or elsewhere on the same zoning lot.

(a)  If any nonconforming building or structure is destroyed by any means to the extent of 50 percent of the cost of replacement of such structure anew, and of that portion of the building or structure which is above the average ground elevation, such building or structure shall not be rebuilt or reoccupied for any use except in accordance with all then-existing regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
(b)  In the event the damage or destruction is less than 50 percent of the cost of the replacement of such structure anew, and of that portion of the building or structure which is above the average ground elevation, such building or structure may be repaired or restored. However, in no case shall an extension or any nonconformity be allowed which would include, but be limited to: increase in bulk, create a change in yard or space, or increase land coverage. Further, such repair or restoration actually shall be begun under a legal village building permit issued within one year after the date of such partial damage or destruction and is completed within the lifespan of the building permit.

Further, the proposed use must be substantially similar and compatible to other uses already listed in the zoning district or districts intended for authorization. 
(5)  If the proposed use holds greater similarity to special uses in a particular zoning district than to that of permitted uses, if allowed, such use shall be noted as a use requiring the issuance of a special use permit.

(c)  The planning and zoning commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing of the variation request. The hearing and notice provisions contained in this chapter shall be complied with fully. 
(d)  The petitioner will also be required to post on the property a sign, to be furnished by the village, which remains the property of the village, which states in general terms that action has been requested potentially affecting some aspect of a change from the zoning ordinance, a public hearing is to be held, and documentation regarding the request is on file and available for public review at the office of the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign and its location are intended to be visible to the general public and serve as an additional notice of a request being made relating to the zoning ordinance. The sign shall be of such size and shall be placed at such a location as is directed by the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign shall be installed by the applicant no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. 
(e)  Whenever supplemental data in connection with a previously filed application is required by the village or offered by the applicant, in proper form and number, it shall be submitted at least ten working days prior to the date of the public hearing. 
(f)  At the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall receive sworn testimony and evidence pertaining to the request for variance and any objections thereto. All evidence offered shall be made a permanent part of the zoning board of appeal's hearing file on the matter. Within 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall render its recommendation for consideration by the village board. 
(g)  Within 45 calendar days after the receipt of the written recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, or by failure of the planning and zoning commission to render a written report, the village board shall act on the request for variance, unless there is an agreement by the village board and the applicant to extend such period of time. 
(h)  In any request for variation where less than four members of the planning and zoning commission shall have recommended the variation, or where the planning and zoning commission recommends a denial, it shall take a positive vote of four members of the board of trustees in order to effect passage of the ordinance granting the variation. 
(i)  Any variation granted by the board of trustees shall be made effective in ordinance form, properly adopted in accordance with applicable state laws. 
(Code 1964, § 30-11.03(B); Ord. No. 2013-69, § 37, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 62-760. - Standards for variation. 
(a)  No variation shall be granted pursuant to this division unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the strict letter of any regulation requested to be varied will result in practical difficulty or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of any regulations and only when the variation granted is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions of this chapter. Evidence of hardship or difficulty that will support a variance must relate to the land itself and not the owner-applicant. 
(b)  The following standards shall be met and proved by the applicant before any positive consideration is to be made in the granting of a variation: 
(1)  The hardship alleged as the basis for the variation must be derived from difficulties pertaining to the property itself which prevent full use of the property of the same extent other properties in close proximity within the same zoning district can be used; 
(2)  The hardship alleged as the basis for a variation must not be self-created or self-imposed by the applicant or his agent nor by unauthorized and unpermitted acts of any prior owner; 
(3)  That there is no other means other then the requested variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the property; 
(4)  That the variation sought will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property; 
(5)  That the variation sought will not unreasonably diminish the values of adjacent property; 
(6)  That the variation sought will not unreasonably increase congestion in the public streets or otherwise endanger public safety; and 
(7)  That the variation is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(c)  In the absence of evidence being presented as part of the public hearing process to justify the preceding conditions, the planning and zoning commission shall issue a recommendation for denial to the village board. 
(d)  Where evidence is presented to the planning and zoning commission as part of the public hearing process that the preceding conditions have been met, the planning and zoning commission shall, in writing, list their findings of fact and recommend only enough relief from the standards and requirements of this chapter will be allowed to meet the minimum need requested. The board of trustees shall then take appropriate and final action regarding the application for variation. 
(e)  The planning and zoning commission shall make a recommendation and may suggest conditions and limitations and the board of trustees may impose such specific conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening and any other matters relating to the purposes and intents of this chapter upon the premises benefited by a variation. Such conditions or limitations shall be made as deemed necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property and also be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the variation. Where the ordinance granting the variation contains conditions or stipulations, such ordinance shall be recorded in the county recorder's office as a covenant upon the property at the expense of the applicant prior to the issuance of any permit to perform work so intended for authorization by the ordinance. 
(f)  Issuance of an ordinance allowing variation does not preclude the responsibility of the applicant from meeting all other applicable codes and ordinances of the village. The issuance of an ordinance allowing a variation does not infer any changes to the text of this chapter or its map, nor does such action confer any rights for similar properties not having been property petitioned for as a variation. 
(g)  A variance shall not be granted where a building or structure was constructed in noncompliance with the building codes of the village in effect at the time of said construction. 
(Code 1964, § 30-11.03(C); Ord. No. 2006-68, 8-28-2006; Ord. No. 2013-69, § 38, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 62-761. - Limitations on variations. 
Subject to an extension of time being granted by the board of trustees, any variation from the provisions of this chapter must be exercised within six months after the effective date of the ordinance granting such variation without any further action by the village. Upon written request prior to the end of the six month life for the variation and the offering by the applicant to the board of trustees, the village board by simple majority vote of board members present at a regular village board meeting may extend the life of the variation by an additional six months. No more than two such extensions shall be granted by the village board. Changes to any codes or ordinances made effective after the original granting of the variation by the village, other than the zoning ordinance. shall be binding upon any construction undertaken after the original six-month period.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Secs. 62-79162-818. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 2. - SPECIAL USES 
 
Sec. 62-819. - Generally. 
(a)  Special uses are generally uses which have unique, special or unusual impact upon the use or the enjoyment of neighboring properties beyond those uses normally included "of right" within any one zoning district. Such uses may include, but are not limited to, public and quasi-public uses affecting the public interest. Planned developments are an example of special uses. 
(b)  The board of trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in this division and by due adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall have authority to grant special uses. 
(Code 1964, § 30-12.01; Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 97-34, 7-14-1997)  
Sec. 62-820. - Granting of board of trustees after hearing. 
Special uses may be granted by the board of trustees of the village after a public hearing is held by the planning and zoning commission, and after the responsible commission or board has made written recommendation to the village board on the matter. A special use shall be permitted only upon evidence that such use meets standards established in this chapter. The granting of the special use may be made subject to specific conditions reasonably necessary to meet such standards. Any special use application which fails to receive a positive recommendation by the respective planning and zoning commission must, in order to gain approval by the village board, receive the favorable vote of two-thirds of all trustees of the village board. 
(Code 1964, § 30-12.01(A); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 97-34, 7-14-1997; Ord. No. 2013-69, § 39, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 62-821. - Procedure. 
(a)  The following procedure is applicable for the filing for an application of any special use permit, excepting one which is intended for a planned development. A planned development is a development technique intended to encourage imaginative design of coordinated land uses and to provide relief from those zoning and subdivision requirements which have been developed for conventional developments. Procedures for application for a planned development are provided later in this division. 
(b)  The application requesting the special use along with the proposed hearing notice and the following material shall be presented to the zoning enforcement administrator not less than ten working days prior to the date of intended publication of the legal notice: 
(1)  A survey of the property; 
(2)  A site plan drawn to scale, showing the location of all existing and proposed structures on the site, including, but not limited to, driveways, loading areas, parking areas, and other development features; 
(3)  A statement specifically outlining the special use sought, its compatibility with the intent and purpose of the specific zoning district proposed for location; the compatibility with existing uses on the site, if any, as well as to uses within the vicinity; and, what, if any special actions are contemplated to modify any unique, special or unusual impacts which the special use may cause or intensity upon properties and uses upon public facilities or neighboring properties; and 
(4)  Additional information which may be required by this division. 
(c)  Upon determination by the zoning enforcement administrator that the legal notice is in proper order and that the application for special use, as well as all materials required, have been properly submitted with appropriate fees, a hearing shall be scheduled before the planning and zoning commission on the first available date, on a first-filed, first-scheduled, space-available basis. All applications for special use shall disclose full ownership of all property for which the special use is sought, as well as that of the person, firm or corporation seeking the license to operate the same. Disclosure shall include those persons having any beneficial interest if the property and/or business is held in trust. 
(d)  In addition to other forms of notice as may be required by this chapter, the applicant will be required to post on the property a sign, to be furnished by the village and which remains the property of the village, which states in general terms that action has been requested potentially affecting some aspect of change or modification of the zoning upon the specific property that a public hearing is to be held and documentation regarding the request is on file and available for public review in the office of the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign and its location are intended to be visible to the general public and serve as additional notice of a request being made relating to the zoning ordinance. The sign shall be of such size and shall be placed at such location as is directed by the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign shall be installed by the applicant no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. 
(e)  At the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall receive sworn testimony and evidence pertaining to the request for the special use and any objections thereto. All evidence shall be made a permanent part of the planning and zoning commission hearing file on the matter. In developing its recommendation, the planning and zoning commission shall determine if, and to what extent, the proposed special use at the particular location is necessary and desirable to provide a service or a facility that is in the interest of the public convenience or will provide for the general welfare of the zoning district or the village as a whole. 
(f)  Also to be considered is the availability of locations for such use at other sites which may permit the requested special use as a "use of right" and which may be more appropriate. Finally, to be considered are any unique, special or unusual circumstances, the extent of the same and what, if any, special conditions, limitations, controls or other mechanisms may be undertaken to lessen or preclude any undesirable effects of granting the special use. 
(g)  Within 30 calendar days of the conclusion of the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall render a recommendation, together with supporting facts and evidence concerning the application for the special use to the village board. Also to be included are any recommendations and conditions which the planning and zoning commission feels are required to eliminate or reduce any negative impact anticipated as a result of the special use. 
(h)  Within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the recommendation from the planning and zoning commission or the final date for which the planning and zoning commission action was due, if no recommendation is received from the planning and zoning commission on the special use application, the board of trustees shall either deny or grant, with or without modifications or conditions and in appropriate ordinance form, the request for the special use sought. Failure of the board of trustees to act within this period of time shall be deemed a denial of the application for the special use permit, unless such period is otherwise extended by the village board upon written request of the petitioner. 
(Code 1964, § 30-12.01(B); Ord. No. 96-14, 3-25-1996; Ord. No. 97-34, 7-14-1997; Ord. No. 2013-69, § 40, 12-16-2013)  
Sec. 62-822. - Procedure for planned developments. 
(a)  The planned development procedure is established to encourage unique solutions for development proposals which, if conforming to standards established for conventional developments, would inhibit innovation and cause undo hardship with regards to parcels which present technical development problems. However, the process is intended to provide for safe and desirable living and working conditions by utilizing new technology, unified use and site development, and amenities, while meeting the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance. 
(b)  Because of the anticipated degree of uniqueness of planned developments, the process set forth in this section will require a series of presentations, meetings and hearings. The following material presented in this section represents the procedure required for applying for a planned development special use: 
(1)  Before submitting necessary materials for a preliminary planned development application, the developer is required to attend a preapplication conference with the village manager, code enforcement director, village engineer and appropriate members of village staff as determined by the village manager. The conference will be scheduled by the village manager at a time convenient to the applicant and village staff. The purpose of the preapplication process is to informally discuss the general concept of the proposed development, its effect on the surrounding area and the village as a whole, and the feasibility of public services. The conference is advisory and is intended to allow both sides to express their concerns and reach mutual conclusions. The following material is to be supplied by the applicant a minimum of five working days prior to the scheduled preapplication conference: 
a.  A survey of the property; 
b.  A site plan drawn to scale, showing the location of all existing and proposed structures on the site, including, but not limited to, driveways, loading areas, parking areas, and other developmental features; 
c.  A statement specifically outlining the planned development; its compatibility with the intent and purpose of the specific zoning district proposed for location; the compatibility with the existing uses on the site, if any, as well as to uses within the vicinity; and, what, if any, special actions are contemplated to modify any unique, special or unusual impacts which the planned development may cause or intensify upon the property, neighboring properties, and public facilities; and 
d.  Other written background material and information the applicant may feel to be of use for the village staff to review. 
(2)  After the preapplication conference has been held, the applicant shall be offered the opportunity to request a preapplication appearance before the planning and zoning commission followed by a preapplication appearance before the village board to informally discuss the initial concept for the proposal. Neither the commission nor the board shall be required to provide a formal position statement or recommendation. The same materials as presented to the preapplication conference with village staff, and as may have been revised, shall be presented a minimum of seven working days prior to the scheduled planning and zoning commission meeting and subsequent meeting or public work session of the village board. Where any materials are of a size greater than 11 inches by 17 inches or are not easily reproducible, they shall be submitted in sufficient quantities as requested by the village manager. 
(3)  After the applicant has held a preapplication conference with village staff, an applicant desirous of proceeding with a planned development may submit an application to request formal, preliminary planned development review. This process involves a formal review and recommendation being developed by village staff; a hearing conducted, and development of a recommendation by the planning and zoning commission regarding the application; and action by the village board, consecutively. The applicant requesting preliminary planned development review along with the proposed hearing notice shall present the following materials to the zoning enforcement administrator a minimum of four weeks prior to the respective meeting/hearing date. The zoning enforcement administrator may require an earlier submission date if the proposed planned development is expected to require additional staff review time. Hearing/meeting dates shall not be established until all required submittals are received and fees paid to the zoning enforcement administrator: 
a.  Completed planned development application form; 
b.  Site plan indicating: 
1.  Project title. 
2.  Notation that the plan is a preliminary planned development site plan. 
3.  Name, address and telephone number of applicant and preparer of the plan. 
4.  Date. 
5.  Scale (one inch equals 100 feet or larger). 
6.  North point. 
7.  Legal description and proposed zoning for each segment of the parcel. 
8.  Area of entire parcel and approximate areas of different land use parcels. 
9.  Floor area of nonresidential structures in each separate section. 
10.  Approximate locations of buildings and structures. 
11.  Schematic representation of existing trees and landscaping proposed. 
12.  Zoning of all adjacent parcels contiguous or directly across any public alley or right-of-way from the project site. 
13.  Character of immediate contiguous property and within 100 feet showing location of streets, easements, utilities, property lines and principal structures. 
14.  Location of proposed streets showing dimensions of rights-of-way and pavement. 
15.  Location and approximate areas of parcels to be dedicated to public bodies and/or reserved for common control by the site's owner or owner's association. 
16.  Floodplain limits as delineated on HUD flood maps of USGS quadrangle maps. 
c.  Topographic maps showing one foot contour intervals. 
d.  Details of all variations requested in the planned development (if no variations are requested, so state that none are being requested). 
e.  Traffic analysis indicating: 
1.  Traffic generation of proposal. 
2.  Impact on existing traffic. 
3.  Improvements needed to minimize negative impact of site-generated traffic on street network. 
f.  Proof of ownership (if ownership is in a land trust, beneficial holders of trust shall be disclosed). 
g.  Preliminary engineering plans. 
h.  Plat of survey of parcels and proposed plat of resubdivision. 
i.  Payment of appropriate fees. 
(4)  Upon determination by the zoning enforcement administrator that the legal notice is in order and that all other documentation required has been submitted, a hearing shall be scheduled before the planning and zoning commission on the first available date on a first-filed, first scheduled, space available basis. 
(5)  In addition to other forms of notice as may be required by this chapter, the applicant will be required to post on the property a sign, to be furnished by the village and which remains the property of the village, which states in general terms that action has been requested potentially affecting some aspect of change or modification of the zoning ordinance, a public hearing is to be held, and documentation regarding the request is on file and available for public review at the office of the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign and its location are intended to be visible to the general public and serve as an additional notice of request being made relating to the zoning ordinance. The sign shall be of such size and shall be placed at such location as is directed by the zoning enforcement administrator. The sign shall be installed by the applicant no more than 30 days nor less than 15 days prior to the date of the scheduled hearing. 
(6)  At the public hearing, the planning and zoning commission shall receive the staff review and recommendations regarding the proposal, sworn testimony and evidence pertaining to the request for preliminary approval of the planned development, and any objections thereto. All evidence shall be made a permanent part of the planning and zoning commission's hearing file on the matter. In developing its recommendation, the planning and zoning commission shall utilize the following criteria: 
a.  Is the proposal compatible with the goals and objective of the Brookfield 2000 Comprehensive Plan, as amended? 
b.  Does the proposal promote high standards in design, site planning and construction? 
c.  Does the proposal provide a safe and desirable environment? 
d.  Does the proposal provide for adequate open space for recreation and other community and/or development needs? 
e.  Does the proposal present a creative and workable approach in land development? 
f.  Is the design compatible with adjacent properties and the adjacent neighborhood? 
g.  Does the development provide for land use, both initial and potential, which will be compatible with existing surrounding land uses? 
h.  By virtue of its benefits to the village and its unique and creative design, does the proposal justify the intended variations from the strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance and justify the special uses requested? 
i.  That proper safeguarding conditions offered by the applicant or determined by the planning and zoning commission will allow the proposal to meet the intents, purposes and standards established for the zoning district and or zoning districts in which it is intended to be located? 
j.  Does the proposal protect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare? 
(7)  Upon the receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, the preliminary planned development application proposal shall be placed on the next available village board committee meeting agenda, provided that there be at least ten working days between such receipt of recommendations and the date of such village board committee meeting to allow the village board members adequate time for consideration of the proposal and the recommendations. The village board shall approve, approve with modifications, refer the proposal back to the planning and zoning commission or disapprove the proposal within 60 days of the conclusion of the planning and zoning commission's public hearing. The board of trustees may continue consideration upon the request of the applicant. In the event the board of trustees disapproves the preliminary planned development application, the applicant may request that the village board refer the matter back to the planning and zoning commission for reconsideration with modification. Failure of the board of trustees to act within this period of time shall be deemed a denial of the application for the planned development. 
(8)  An approved application for a preliminary planned development is valid for a period of 12 months after final action by the village board. 
(9)  Following approval of the preliminary planned development application by the village board, the applicant must submit required materials for final planned development approval should he wish to proceed. Final planned development approval may be requested for the entire planned development or segments thereof. However, if final approval is sought for a portion of the planned development, the segment must conform to previously approved preliminary planned development application. If a segmented development is proposed, a specific schedule of the various components must be submitted for approval as part of the final approval. The developer must adhere to the development schedule timetable or request an extension by the village board who may or may not grant such request, or may request certain surety to guarantee that the final development is completed in conformity with the overall development plan. Improvements on or off site necessary to support the segment shall be subject to the approval of the village board before final permits will be issued. 
(10)  Final planned development applications are reviewed by village staff, the planning and zoning commission and the village board, consecutively. 
(11)  The final planned development must be in general conformance with the previously approved preliminary planned development application and plans. If the final planned development plans are substantially different, then the proposal must be viewed as a new application for preliminary application and procedures required for such preliminary application, including the hearing process and payment of new filing fees must be begun anew. If the site has been altered by a minor increase or decrease in size or if additional variances are sought requiring additional public hearings before final approval can be considered, then the planning and zoning commission shall hold an additional public hearing in the manner, form and for the purposes as required under the procedures governing preliminary planned development approval. Upon review and recommendation for approval by the planning and zoning commission and acceptance of the recommendation by the village board, the village board, by ordinance, shall issue a special use permit authorizing the planned development plan. 
(12)  The application requesting final planned development approval along with the following materials shall be presented to the zoning enforcement administrator a minimum of four weeks prior to the intended scheduled appearance before the planning and zoning commission. The zoning enforcement administrator may require an earlier submission if the proposed planned development is expected to require additional staff review. The meeting shall not be established until all required submittals are received by the zoning enforcement administrator and then only on a first-received, first-scheduled, space-available basis. All materials shall be supplied at the time of submission in a quantity to be approved by the village manager. The material submitted shall contain: 
a.  Completed planned development application form. 
b.  Site plan indicating: 
1.  Project title. 
2.  Notation that the plan is the final planned development site plan. 
3.  Name, address and telephone number of applicant and preparer of the site plan. 
4.  Date. 
5.  Scale (one inch equals 100 feet or larger scale). 
6.  North point. 
7.  Zoning of all adjacent parcels. 
8.  Character of immediately contiguous property within 100 feet showing location of streets, easements, utilities, property lines and principal structures. 
9.  Location of proposed streets showing dimensions of right-of-way and pavement. 
10.  Location and approximate areas of parcels to be dedicated to public bodies and/or reserved for common control by the owner or the property owners' association. 
11.  Floodplain limits as delineated on HUD flood hazard maps or USGS quadrangle maps. 
12.  Sidewalk and walkway locations, actual and proposed. 
13.  Specific details by parcel for separate zoning districts or areas of differing use intensity to include: 
(i)  Gross area. 
(ii)  Net area (gross area less public right-of-way areas). 
(iii)  Building coverage, floor area, height. 
(iv)  Parking spaces, total design, including count. 
(v)  Hard-surfaced coverage, including buildings and all structures. 
(vi)  Number of dwelling units by bedroom mix and net density, if any. 
14.  Building locations. 
15.  Floor plans (if not available, parking requirements shall be based on the square footage of the buildings, number of dwelling units and similar available information). 
c.  Landscape plan detailing: 
1.  Proposed types (common names), sizes, trunk diameter, and whether sodded or seeded; 
2.  Existing trees with trunk diameter of four inches or greater, and whether to be saved or not; 
3.  Berming and/or screening where proposed; and 
4.  Location and design for exterior trash and recycling containment and collection. 
d.  Building elevations, all sides. 
e.  Development schedule by phase, including projected start and completion dates, and proposed date of dedication of any public areas. 
f.  Three copies of: 
1.  Covenants and restrictions for ownership, use and maintenance of common areas; 
2.  Final engineering plans; and 
3.  Plat of survey intended for recording. 
(13)  The planning and zoning commission shall review and evaluate the application for the final planned development in terms of whether the proposal: 
a.  Is in general conformity with the previously approved preliminary planned development proposal; 
b.  By virtue of its imaginative and creative design and benefits to the village, justifies the intended variations from the strict application of the subdivision standards and zoning ordinance; and 
c.  Requires additional conditions or restrictions to protect the public interest and adjacent areas, improve the development and ensure compliance with existing village ordinances. 
(14)  The planning and zoning commission shall review the final application and plan for the planned development and forward its recommendation to the village board within 30 days after the concluding meeting held with the applicant, and the receipt of all required information. Failure to act within the prescribed period of time, and unless the time limit shall be extended by mutual agreement of the planning and zoning commission and the applicant, shall be deemed a denial of the application for the planned development. 
(15)  The village board shall take under advisement the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission when considering their final approval of the planned development application. The village board shall approve, approve with modification, both in ordinance form, or disapprove the final application for the planned development within 60 days of the receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, unless an extension is requested by the applicant. Should the final planned development be disapproved by the village board, the petitioner may submit revised plans to the village board for reconsideration, if permission to submit is requested by the applicant and granted by the village board. Failure of the village board to act within the period of time so stated shall be deemed a denial of the application for the planned development, unless the petitioner requests and the village board grants an extension of the period. 
(16)  It shall be the responsibility of the code enforcement director to review all plans submitted for building permits and it shall be the responsibility of the zoning enforcement administrator to review all plans intended for development permits and to certify conformity with the approved final planned development plans and specifications. 
(17)  The village manager may, from time to time, approve minor changes within the project, but such changes shall not be of a nature that would affect the character and standard of the planned development. 
(18)  Unless the applicant or a successor to the applicant has substantially completed construction of the public improvements and has commenced construction of the uses approved in the planned development, the special use permit issued for the planned development shall automatically, and with no further action by the village board, expire 24 months after the final action of approval by the village board. Upon written petition by the holder of the planned development special use permit, and upon the finding of good cause by the village board prior to the expiration of the planned development special use permit, the village board may extend the permit for an additional period of 12 months. There shall be no obligation upon the village board to extend such period.

Specifically, the action shall include the issuance of an order directing immediate discontinuation of any illegal or unauthorized use of land, buildings or structures, the removal of illegal structures, additions or alterations, and discontinuance of illegal or unpermitted work being done in violation of this chapter.
