County animal control.
J. Section 5-3-10 of the Village Code of Ordinances shall be amended as
follows:
A. Dangerous Dog:
1. In order to have a dog deemed “dangerous,” the animal control officer or sworn law
enforcement officer must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to
the owner, conduct an investigation, and issue a written report to deem a dog to be
“dangerous.” The determination, which shall also include a complete description of the
appeal process, shall be transmitted by mail or personally served to the owner. No dog shall
be deemed a “dangerous dog” unless shown to be a dangerous dog by a preponderance of
the evidence. A dog shall not be declared dangerous if it is determined the conduct of the
dog was justified because:
a)The threat was sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime or
offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog or was committing a willful trespass
or other tort upon the premises or property occupied by the owner of the animal;
b) The threatened person was abusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the dog
or its offspring;
c)The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking or threatening to
attack the dog or its offspring; or
d) The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its owner,
custodian, or a member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
2. If a dog is deemed dangerous, the animal control officer or chief of police shall order the
dog to be spayed or neutered and microchipped, if not already within fourteen (14) days at
the owner’s sole cost and expense, and may order one or more of the following as deemed
appropriate under the circumstances and necessary for the protection of the public:
a)That said animal shall be kept within an area fenced by a fence six feet (6’) in height,
and all gates within said fence shall be locked at all times or on a run line when not
confined in the owner’s home.
b) That said animal shall be under the direct control of an adult, eighteen (18) years
of age or older, by the use of a leash or lead not more than six feet (6’) in length
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 16/714
whenever the animal is not confined or controlled on the owner’s property.
c)The chief of police or animal control officer may also order a dangerous dog to be
muzzled whenever it is not confined or controlled on the owner’s property in a
manner that will prevent it from biting any person or animal, but that shall not injure
the dog or interfere with its vision or respiration.
B. Vicious Dog:
1. In order to have a dog deemed “vicious,” the animal control officer or sworn law
enforcement officer must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to
the owner, conduct an investigation, and present a written report recommending a finding
that the dog is a vicious dog to the Village attorney and owner. The Village attorney, or any
citizen of the Village in which the dog exists may file a complaint or suitable pleading in the
circuit court in the name of the Village to deem a dog to be a vicious dog. The animal
control officer shall determine in the interim if and where the animal shall be confined
during the pendency of the case. The animal control officer’s determination shall be final
pending an order of the court. A dog may not be declared “vicious” if the court determines
that the conduct of the dog was justified because:
a)The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the time was
committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog, or was
committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises or property occupied by
the owner of the animal;
b) The injured, threatened, or killed person was abusing, assaulting, or physically
threatening the dog or its offspring, or has in the past abused, assaulted, or physically
threatened the dog or its offspring; or
c)The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its owner,
custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
If the burden of proof has been met, and the court so determines, the dog shall be
deemed to be a vicious dog. If the court finds that a vicious dog should not be
destroyed, the dog shall be spayed or neutered and microchipped, at the expense of
the owner, within ten (10) days of the finding. A dog found to be a vicious dog shall
not be released to the owner until the chief of police or animal control officer
approved of the enclosure in which the dog shall be kept pursuant to subsection B2
of this section. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog
without approval of the chief of police, animal control officer or the court.
2. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which has been found to be
a vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The only times that a vicious dog may
be allowed out of the enclosure are : 1) if it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain
veterinary care for the dog, 2) in case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog’s
life is threatened, or 3) to comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
provided that the dog is securely muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding three

5-3-10: DANGEROUS AND VICIOUS DOGS:
A. Dangerous Dog:
1. In order to have a dog deemed "dangerous", the animal control officer or sworn law enforcement
officer must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct
an investigation, and issue a written report to deem a dog to be "dangerous". The determination,
which shall also include a complete description of the appeal process, shall be transmitted by mail
or personally served to the owner. No dog shall be deemed a "dangerous dog" unless shown to be
a dangerous dog by a preponderance of evidence. A dog shall not be declared dangerous if it is
determined the conduct of the dog was justified because:
a. The threat was sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime or offense upon
the owner or custodian of the dog or was committing a wilful trespass or other tort upon the
premises or property occupied by the owner of the animal;
b. The threatened person was abusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the dog or its offspring;
c. The injured, threatened, or killed companion animal was attacking or threatening to attack the
dog or its offspring; or
d. The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or a
member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
2. If a dog is deemed dangerous, the animal control officer or chief of police shall order the dog to be
spayed or neutered and microchipped, if not already within fourteen (14) days at the owner's sole
cost and expense, and may order one or more of the following as deemed appropriate under the
circumstances and necessary for the protection of the public:
a. That said animal shall be kept within an area fenced by a fence six feet (6') in height, and all
gates within said fence shall be locked at all times or on a run line when not confined in the
owner's home.
b. That said animal shall be under the direct control of an adult, eighteen (18) years of age or older,
by the use of a leash or lead not more than six feet (6') in length whenever the animal is not
confined or controlled on the owner's property.
c. The chief of police or animal control officer may also order a dangerous dog to be muzzled
whenever it is not confined or controlled on the owner's property in a manner that will prevent it
from biting any person or animal, but that shall not injure the dog or interfere with its vision or
respiration.
B. Vicious Dog:
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 216/714
1. In order to have a dog deemed "vicious", the animal control officer or sworn law enforcement officer
must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct an
investigation, and present a written report recommending a finding that the dog is a vicious dog to
the village attorney and owner. The village attorney, or any citizen of the village in which the dog
exists may file a complaint or suitable pleading in the circuit court in the name of the village to deem
a dog to be a vicious dog. The animal control officer shall determine in the interim if and where the
animal shall be confined during the pendency of the case. The animal control officer's determination
shall be final pending an order of the court. A dog may not be declared "vicious" if the court
determines that the conduct of the dog was justified because:
a. The threat, injury, or death was sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime or
offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog, or was committing a wilful trespass or other tort
upon the premises or property occupied by the owner of the animal;
b. The injured, threatened, or killed person was abusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the
dog or its offspring, or has in the past abused, assaulted, or physically threatened the dog or its
offspring; or
c. The dog was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or
member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
If the burden of proof has been met, and the court so determines, the dog shall be deemed to be
a vicious dog. If the court finds that a vicious dog should not be destroyed, the dog shall be
spayed or neutered and microchipped, at the expense of the owner, within ten (10) days of the
finding. A dog found to be a vicious dog shall not be released to the owner until the chief of police
or animal control officer approves of the enclosure in which the dog shall be kept pursuant to
subsection B2 of this section. No owner or keeper of a vicious dog shall sell or give away the dog
without approval of the chief of police, animal control officer or the court.
2. It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain any dog which has been found to be a
vicious dog unless the dog is kept in an enclosure. The only times that a vicious dog may be
allowed out of the enclosure are: 1) if it is necessary for the owner or keeper to obtain veterinary
care for the dog, 2) in case of an emergency or natural disaster where the dog's life is threatened,
or 3) to comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the dog is securely
muzzled and restrained with a leash not exceeding three feet (3') in length, and shall be under the
direct control and supervision of the owner or keeper of the vicious dog or muzzled in its residence.
C. Exemption: Guide dogs for the blind or hearing impaired, support dogs for the physically handicapped
and guard or police owned dogs are exempt from this section; provided an attack or injury to a person
occurs while the dog is performing duties as expected. To qualify for exemption under this section,
each such dog shall be currently inoculated against rabies in accordance with the law of the state and
any other applicable law. It shall be the duty of the owner of such exempted dog to notify the chief of
police or animal control officer of changes of address. In the case of a guard dog, the owner shall
keep the police and fire departments advised of the location where such dog will be stationed.
D. Impoundment Of Dangerous Or Vicious Dog: The chief of police or animal control officer has the right
to impound a dangerous or vicious dog if the owner fails to comply with the requirements of this
chapter or court order. Any dog which has been found to be a vicious dog and which is not confined to
an enclosure shall be impounded. If the owner of the vicious dog has not appealed the impoundment
order to the circuit court within fifteen (15) business days the dog shall be considered the property of
the township animal control officer and turned over to a licensed veterinarian to be euthanized. Any
costs of such impoundment and disposal shall be the obligation of the owner. (Ord. 2009-O-013, 5-11-

12-10-2007)
7-1D-6: EFFECT OF PERMIT:
A. Authority Granted; No Property Right Or Other Interest Created: A permit from the village authorizes a
permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this article on village rights of way,
and does not create a property right or grant authority to the permittee to impinge upon the rights of
others who may have an interest in the rights of way.
B. Duration: No permit issued under this article shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion.

article prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and subcontractors who will
perform any work under the permit at a preconstruction meeting. The preconstruction meeting shall
be held at a date, time and place designated by the village with such village representatives in
attendance as the village deems necessary. The meeting shall be for the purpose of reviewing the
work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations necessary in the areas where work will

locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities, use of rights of way by the public during
construction, and access and egress by adjacent property owners.
D. Compliance With All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the village does not excuse the
permittee from complying with other requirements of the village and applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations. (Ord. 2007-O-046, 12-10-2007)
7-1D-7: REVISED PERMIT DRAWINGS:

identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the permittee
shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the village within ninety (90) days after the completion
of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the
actual facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also
deviates from the requirements of this article, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance
with section 7-1D-21 of this article. If the village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee
shall either remove the facility from the right of way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit
and submit revised drawings or plans therefor. (Ord. 2007-O-046, 12-10-2007)

the work, then such contractors and subcontractors shall comply with this section.
B. Excess Or Umbrella Policies: The coverages required by this section may be in any combination of
primary, excess, and umbrella policies. Any excess or umbrella policy must provide excess coverage
over underlying insurance on a following form basis such that when any loss covered by the primary
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 299/714
policy exceeds the limits under the primary policy, the excess or umbrella policy becomes effective to

prior to said cancellation, the utility shall obtain and furnish to the village evidence of replacement
insurance policies meeting the requirements of this section.
E. Self-Insurance: A utility may self-insure all or a portion of the insurance coverage and limit
requirements required by subsection A of this section. A utility that self-insures is not required, to the
extent of such self-insurance, to comply with the requirement for the naming of additional insureds
under subsection A of this section, or the requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section. A
utility that elects to self-insure shall provide to the village evidence sufficient to demonstrate its
financial ability to self-insure the insurance coverage and limit requirements required under
subsection A of this section, such as evidence that the utility is a "private self-insurer" under the
workers' compensation act.
F. Effect Of Insurance And Self-Insurance On Utility's Liability: The legal liability of the utility to the village
and any person for any of the matters that are the subject of the insurance policies or self-insurance

resulting from or alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful acts, omissions,
failures to act or misconduct of the utility or its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of facilities or occupancy of the rights of way, and in providing or
offering service over the facilities, whether such acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited
by this article or by a franchise, license, or similar agreement; provided, however, that the utility's
indemnity obligations hereunder shall not apply to any injuries, claims, demands, judgments, damages,

the village, its officials, officers, employees, agents or representatives. (Ord. 2007-O-046, 12-10-2007)
7-1D-10: SECURITY:
A. Purpose: The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this
section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the
permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The
security fund shall serve as security for:
1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to
comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued
pursuant to this article; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village
may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article
including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is
required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a
consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due
the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's
election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit
in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this
subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts
covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at which it can be
drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably
estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the
construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee
fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be
performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of
facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will
not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the
director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single
amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The
amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would
have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason
for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount

2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the village has
been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the village determines can be remedied by an
expenditure of an amount in the security fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any
amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the
amount specified in subsection C of this section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security
fund be returned to the permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village,
provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance
required in subsection C of this section.
G. Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the
permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on
deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law.
In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest
therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable
costs, loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation, provided that any
amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.
H. Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to
all other rights of the village, whether reserved by this article or otherwise authorized by law, and no
action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other right the
village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary
recovery with respect to any of its rights which may be infringed or otherwise violated. (Ord. 2007-O-
046, 12-10-2007)

subsection C of this section, the village or its designee may, at the option of the village: 1) correct the
deficiencies; 2) upon not less than twenty (20) days' notice to the permittee, remove the subject
facilities or equipment; or 3) after not less than thirty (30) days' notice to the permittee of failure to
cure the noncompliance, deem them abandoned and property of the village. The permittee shall be
liable in all events to the village for all costs of removal. (Ord. 2007-O-046, 12-10-2007)

useful life.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 358/714
D. Unit Rates: The unit rate for the sewer charge shall be determined by:
1. Dividing estimated annual operation and maintenance costs by estimated annual wastewater
volume in thousand gallons.
2. Dividing estimated annual replacement costs by estimated annual wastewater volume in thousand
gallons.
3. Adding subsections D1 and D2 of this section to obtain the sewer charge unit rate per thousand
gallons.
E. Surcharge: A surcharge will be levied on all users who discharge wastewaters exceeding normal
domestic waste strengths of two hundred milligrams per liter (200 mg/l) BOD and two hundred fifty
milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) suspended solids. The surcharge will be calculated by applying the
rates specified in section 7-3E-6 of this article to the pounds of BOD and suspended solids
discharged above the normal domestic waste strengths.
F. Notice Of Rates: Each user will be notified annually by the village in conjunction with a regular bill of
the sewer user charge rate.
G. The method for computation of rates and service charges established for user charges in this section
shall be made available to a user within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request for such. Any
disagreement over the method used or in the computations thereof shall be remedied by the village
board within sixty (60) days after notification of a formal written appeal outlining the discrepancies.
(Ord. 1151, 6-5-1989)
H. Billable flow is the estimate of sewer usage as recorded by water meters. Billable flow shall be one
hundred percent (100%) of the recorded water meter usage, unless an approved sewage meter or
deduct meter as provided in section 7-3A-10 of this chapter is provided by the user.
1. Additional charges:
a. Actual costs incurred for water meter inspection requested by the user or as required for billing
purposes.
b. Actual costs incurred for handling a users check with nonsufficient funds.
c. Actual costs incurred for special handling not provided for elsewhere in this article.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 359/714
period to be established by the village. All nonresidential users shall be required to meter sewage flows.
A one time handling charge equal to ten percent (10%) of charges due shall be added to all charges due
for sewer service if the bill is not paid within fifteen (15) days of the rendition of the statement.
In the event that a customer has not paid sewer charges within thirty (30) days after the same is
rendered, it shall be the duty of the proper officers of the village to shut off the water supply to said
customer until such time as all past due bills for sewer service are fully paid, together with a service
charge, in accordance with section 7-3D-3 of this chapter, for the restoration of water service, provided
that in cases of genuine hardship, the village treasurer or her designee may set up a monthly payment
schedule for such customer and avoid the necessity of shutting off water.
Nonreceipt of any bill described in this section shall not release liability of user for those charges. In any
case where the user is responsible for the nonreceipt of bill, the conditions herein described for late
payment and additional charges shall apply thereto. In any case where the village is responsible for the
nonreceipt of a bill, the village, at its discretion, may grant the user an extension of any discount period
and late payment conditions described herein. (Ord. 1294, 4-13-1992)
7-3E-4: ACCOUNTING:
A. All sewer charge monies shall be placed in the sewerage fund. Sewer charge monies for the operation
and maintenance shall be kept in separate accounts from the monies collected for the replacement
reserve. Sewer charge funds shall be used to cover costs as outlined in section 7-3E-2 of this article.
B. Expenditure shall be made by the village management in accordance with the detailed annual budget
and ordinances authorized by the village board.
C. Expenditures from the replacement reserve on facilities shall be for making renewals to accommodate
wear of physical elements and/or movable property, which would result in an extended useful life or
meet the anticipated useful life.
D. An audit shall be performed no less than once per annum. Such audit shall be performed by a certified
public accountant selected by the village board. The annual audit as performed by the village shall
satisfy this requirement.
E. The USEPA or its authorized representative shall have access to any books, documents, papers and
records of the village which are applicable to the village system of user charges for the purpose of
making audit, examination, excerpts and transcriptions thereof to insure compliance with the terms of
the federal regulations and conditions of the federal grant. (Ord. 1151, 6-5-1989)
7-3E-5: NONPAYMENT OF BILLS:
A. Whenever sewer bills become delinquent as set forth in section 7-3E-3 of this article, the same shall
become and constitute a lien upon the real estate to which sewer service is supplied pursuant to the
terms and provisions of the Illinois municipal code1. Statements rendered for such charge shall be
deemed notice to all parties, whether or not the person charged with the statement is the owner of the
property served. The claim for lien shall be made in the form of a sworn statement setting out: 1) a
description of the real estate, sufficient for the identification thereof, upon or for which the sewerage
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 360/714
service was supplied, 2) the amount or amounts of money due for such sewerage service, and 3) the
date or dates when such amount or amounts became delinquent. If all amounts shown due remain
unpaid after recording as provided by law, the village may foreclose such lien in like manner and with
like effect as in the foreclosure of mortgages on real estate. In the alternative, the village may, in its
discretion, file suit to collect such amounts as are delinquent and due against the occupant or user of
the real estate in a civil action, and shall collect, as well, all attorney fees incurred by it, the same to
be fixed by order of the court. In addition to penalties and costs attributable and chargeable to the
recording of such notices of lien, user and owner shall be liable for interest upon all unpaid balances
after delinquency remaining from time to time unpaid at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.
B. In all cases where the sewer service charge has become delinquent and the village elects to file a
statement thereof in the office of recorder of deeds as hereinabove set forth, there shall be added in
addition to the amount due the village such charges and expenses as are necessary and required to
verify the legal description of the property to which the lien is to attach, plus a sum established by the
village board as sufficient to cover the cost of preparation of such notices and forms required. In each
instance, the clerk or duly appointed employee of the village shall be authorized and directed to
include such additional costs in the amount claimed due the village in the notice of lien.
C. The village reserves the right to revoke discharge permits and disconnect service to any user
whenever bills become delinquent.
D. All amounts charged under this section and section 7-3E-3 of this article are due and shall continue to
be due hereunder, whether or not said sewer is disconnected, and no sewer shall be reconnected
until the village is paid in full for all amounts due it and in addition, there shall be paid the village a
deposit equal to the estimated charge for the next succeeding year. Such deposit shall be held by the
village in escrow, and will be returned upon satisfactory payment of bills for a period of two (2) years.
(Ord. 1151, 6-5-1989)

7-3F-1: DEFINITIONS:
For the purpose of this article the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning:
AIR GAP SEPARATION: A physical break between a supply pipe and a receiving vessel. The air gap
shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top rim of the
vessel, and in no case less than one inch (1").
APPROVED CHECK VALVE: A check valve that seats readily and completely. It must be carefully
machined to have free moving parts and assured watertightness. The face of the closure element and
valve seat must be bronze, composition, or other noncorrodible material which will seat tightly under all
prevailing conditions of field use. Pins and bushings shall be bronze or other noncorrodible, nonsticking
material, machined for easy, dependable operation. The closure element (e.g., clapper) shall be internally
weighted or otherwise internally equipped to promote rapid and positive closure in all sizes where this
feature is obtainable.
APPROVED DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY: An assembly of at least two (2) independently acting
approved check valves including tightly closing shutoff valves on each side of the check valve assembly
and suitable leak detector drains plus connections available for testing the watertightness of each check
valve. Unless otherwise authorized by the superintendent of public works, a pressure relief valve, rated at
no more than fifty (50) psi greater than the water service pressure, shall be installed on the downstream
side of the double check valve assembly.
APPROVED REDUCED CHECK PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE: A
device incorporating two (2) or more valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located
between the two (2) checks, two (2) shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for
testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two (2) check valves,
less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow the
pressure between the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either
check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to
the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two (2) pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall
open to the atmosphere thereby providing an air gap in the device. To be approved, these devices must
be readily accessible for maintenance and testing and installed in a location where no part of the device
will be submerged. Unless otherwise authorized by the superintendent of public works, a pressure relief
valve rated at no more than fifty (50) psi greater than the water service pressure, shall be installed on the
downstream side of the reduced pressure principle flow prevention device.
APPROVED WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply approved by, or under the public supervision of the
superintendent of public works. In determining what constitutes an approved water supply, the
superintendent shall have the final judgment as to its safety and potability.
AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY: Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the village
water supply.
CONSUMER: Any person to whom water is sold and furnished from the village water supply by the
village.
CONTAMINATION: An impairment of the quality of the village water supply by the presence of any
foreign substance (organic, inorganic, radiological, or biological) to a degree which creates a hazard to
the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.
CROSS CONNECTION: Any unprotected connection between any part of the village waterworks system
used or intended to supply water for drinking purposes, and any source or system containing water or
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

substances that are not or cannot be approved as safe, wholesome, and potable for human
consumption.
PERSON: Any natural person, firm, association, organization, partnership, trust, or association of
persons, joint venture, corporation, or company.
PREMISES: Integrated land area, including improvements thereon, undivided by public thoroughfares or
water distribution mains of the village where all parts of the premises are operated under the same
management and for the same purpose.
PROTECTIVE DEVICE: Any of the following devices:
A. Air gap separation;
B. Approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device; or
C. Approved double check valve assembly.
SERVICE CONNECTION: The terminal end of a service connection from the village water supply at its
point of delivery to the consumer. If a meter is installed, "service connection" means the downstream end
of the meter. No unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter of backflow protective
device located at the point of delivery to the consumer shall be permitted.
SUPERINTENDENT: The superintendent of public works of the village or his authorized representatives.
WATER SUPPLY OF VILLAGE: An approved water supply sold and delivered to consumers' premises
through the waterworks system of the village. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-2: AUXILIARY WATER SUPPLY:
A. Each service connection from the village water supply for furnishing water to premises having an
auxiliary water supply shall be protected against backflow of water from the premises into the village
water supply, unless the auxiliary water supply is an approved water supply or is accepted as an
additional source by the superintendent of public works.
B. If the auxiliary water supply is not an approved water supply or if it is not accepted as an additional
source and approved in the manner specified in subsection A of this section, and the auxiliary water
supply is handled in a separate piping system with no known cross connection, the village water
supply shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly installed at the service
connection to the premises. When the auxiliary water supply may be contaminated, the
superintendent may order the village water supply protected by an air gap separation or an approved
reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device installed at the service connection.
C. If the auxiliary water supply is not an approved water supply or if it is not accepted as an additional
source and approved in the manner specified in subsection A of this section, and cross connections
are known to exist between the village water supply and the auxiliary water supply which cannot
presently be eliminated, the village water supply shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device installed at the service connection to the premises. A double
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

check valve assembly may be used in lieu of such device if the experience of the superintendent
indicates that double check valves are reliably operated, and if approved by the superintendent.
D. When the auxiliary water supply may be contaminated, the superintendent may order the village water
supply protected by an air gap separation installed at the service connection. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-3: TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES UNDER PRESSURE:
At the service connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health or toxic substance
in toxic concentration is or may be handled under pressure, the village water supply shall be protected by
an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all
piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot
reasonably be met, the village water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention device which is acceptable to the superintendent of public works. (Ord.
1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-4: TOXIC OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES NOT UNDER PRESSURE:
At the service connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health or toxic substance
in toxic concentration is not handled under pressure but is otherwise handled in such a manner as to
constitute a cross connection, the village water supply shall be protected by an approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention device, unless such cross connection is abated to the satisfaction
of the superintendent of public works. An approved double check valve assembly may be used in lieu of
such device if experience indicates that double check valves are reliably operated and if approved by the
superintendent. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-5: NONHAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES:
At the service connection to any premises on which a substance that would be objectionable (but not
necessarily hazardous to health) if introduced into the village water supply is handled in such a manner
as to constitute a cross connection, the village water supply shall be protected by an approved double
check valve assembly unless such cross connection is abated to the satisfaction of the superintendent of
public works. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-6: SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS AND PUMPING STATIONS:
At the sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping station, the village water supply shall be protected by
an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all
piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be
reasonably met, the village water supply shall be protected with an approved reduced pressure principle
backflow prevention device, provided this alternative is acceptable to the superintendent of public works.
(Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-7: SERVICE CONNECTIONS FROM VILLAGE WATER SUPPLY:
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

A. Each service connection from the village water supply for furnishing water to premises on which any
substance is or may be handled in such a manner as to permit entry into the village water supply shall
be protected against backflow of the substance from the premises into the village water supply. This
shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the village water supply
which have been subject to change in quality.
B. Backflow protection devices shall be installed on the service connection to any premises that have
internal cross connections unless such cross connections are abated to the satisfaction of the
superintendent of public works. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-8: CONSUMER TO INSTALL, MAINTAIN REQUIRED PROTECTION DEVICES:
A. It shall be the responsibility of each consumer at his own expense to furnish, install, and keep in good
working order and safe condition any and all protective devices required in this article. The village
shall not be responsible for any loss or damage directly or indirectly resulting from or caused by the
improper or negligent installation, operation, use, repair, maintenance of, or interference with any
protective device by any consumer or any other person.
B. Whenever two (2) or more conditions exist on any premises for the correction of which different
protective devices are required in this article, the consumer shall be required only to install the
protective device which, in the opinion of the superintendent of public works, affords the maximum
protection to the village water supply. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-9: WATER MAINS; HORIZONTAL SEPARATION:
A. A water main shall be laid at least ten feet (10') horizontally from any existing or proposed drain or
sewer line. However, should local conditions prevail which would prevent a lateral separation of ten
feet (10'), a water main may be laid closer than ten feet (10') to, or in the same trench as a storm or
sanitary sewer provided the main is laid in a separate trench or on an undisturbed earth shelf located
to one side of the sewer and at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is at least
eighteen inches (18") above the top of the sewer.
B. If it is impossible to obtain proper horizontal and vertical separation as stipulated in this section and
section 7-3F-10 of this article, both the water main and sewer shall be constructed of mechanical
joint, cast iron pipe and shall be pressure tested to assure watertightness before backfilling. (Ord.
1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-10: WATER MAINS; VERTICAL SEPARATION:
A. Whenever water mains must cross house sewers, storm drains, or sanitary sewers, the water main
shall be laid at such an elevation that the bottom of the water main is eighteen inches (18") above the
top of the drain or sewer. This vertical separation shall be maintained for that portion of the water
main located within ten feet (10'), horizontally, of any sewer or drain crossed, this ten feet (10') to be
measured as the normal distance from the water main to the drain or sewer.
B. However, where conditions exist such that the minimum vertical separation set forth in subsection A of
this section cannot be maintained, or it is necessary for the water main to pass under a sewer or
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

drain, the water main shall be laid with mechanical joint, cast iron pipe; and the mechanical joint pipe
shall extend on each side of the crossing until the normal distance from the water main to the sewer
or drain line is at least ten feet (10'). Where a water main must cross under a sewer, a vertical
separation of eighteen inches (18") between the bottom of the sewer and the top of the water main
shall be maintained, along with means to support the larger sized sewer lines to prevent their settling
and breaking the water main. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-11: WATER SERVICE LINES:
The horizontal and vertical separation between water service lines and all sanitary sewer, storm sewers,
or any drain shall be the same as for water mains as detailed in sections 7-3F-9 and 7-3F-10 of this
article. However, when minimum horizontal and vertical separation cannot be maintained, brass, copper,
in addition to mechanical joint, cast iron pipe, may be used for water service lines. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-
1991)
7-3F-12: INSPECTIONS OF PROTECTION DEVICES REQUIRED ANNUALLY; COSTS:
A. The consumer on whose premises any protective device is installed shall have each device inspected
annually. If successive inspections disclose repeated failures in the operation of any device, the
superintendent of public works may require more frequent inspections. Each device shall be repaired,
overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the consumer whenever it is found to be defective. Records
of such tests, repairs, and overhauls shall be kept and made available to the superintendent. The
superintendent shall have the duty of determining that the inspections required herein are performed
properly.
B. If following demand therefor, the consumer fails to have any of the inspections made as required
herein or to make the above described records available, the superintendent shall have the right to
arrange the inspection of the device and the consumer shall pay the cost thereof. The cost of any
inspection made by the superintendent shall be included as part of the next ensuing municipal water
bill presented to the consumer.
C. For the purpose of making any inspections or discharging the duties imposed by this article, the
superintendent shall have the right to enter upon the premises of any consumer. Each consumer, as a
condition of the continued delivery to his premises of the water from the village water supply, shall be
considered as having stated his consent to the entry upon his premises of the superintendent for the
purposes stated herein. (Ord. 1253, 6-24-1991)
7-3F-13: DISCONTINUANCE OF WATER SERVICE UPON NONCOMPLIANCE:
A. No water service connection shall be installed on the premises of any consumer unless the village
water supply is protected as required by this article.
B. Delivery of water to the premises of any consumer may be discontinued by the superintendent of

his sole discretion from issuing a permit for the partial construction of a building or structure prior to

statements have been submitted. The holder of a permit in part shall proceed at the holder's own risk,
without assurance from the building official that a full permit will be granted.

landscape deposit shall be returned to the permit applicant upon completion of all items on the
approved landscape plan to the satisfaction of the village. In the case of a deposit made in the form of
a credit card payment, the refund shall be to the credit card company. The utilization of this landscape
deposit shall not prevent the village from taking any action against any person responsible for any
defect preventing the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, including, but not limited to, the filing of
a lawsuit for injunction, ordinance violation or the withdrawal of the occupancy permit. Without regard
to any provision contained within this title, the village shall not release the landscape deposit until the

8-1-7: CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY:
A. Occupancy Certificates: No structures or additions thereto constructed, moved, remodeled or
reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter shall be occupied and used for any purpose, and
no land vacant on the effective date of this chapter shall be used for any other use, unless an
occupancy certificate shall first have been obtained from the village certifying that the proposed use
or occupancy complies with all provisions of this chapter and section 9-4-2 of this code. The building
official shall approve such certificate of occupancy.
1. Application For Occupancy Certificate: Every application for a building permit shall be deemed an
application for an occupancy certificate. Every application for an occupancy certificate for a new or
changed use of land or structures where no building permit is required shall be filed with the
building official and be in such a form and contain such information as the building official may
prescribe.
2. Issuance Of Occupancy Certificate: No occupancy certificate for a structure or addition thereto to
be constructed, moved, remodeled or reconstructed after the effective date of this chapter shall be
issued until such work has been completed, including off street parking spaces and site
landscaping, and the premises inspected by the building official or his duly authorized agent and
determined to be in full and complete compliance with the plans and specifications upon which the
issuance of the building permit was based. Pending the issuance of a permanent occupancy
certificate, a temporary occupancy certificate may be issued to be valid for a period of time not to
exceed six (6) months from its date of issuance. A cash bond in an amount equal to one hundred
fifty percent (150%) of the village's estimate of completion costs shall be submitted with any
application for a temporary occupancy certificate. A temporary occupancy certificate shall contain
such conditions as the building official may prescribe.
3. Requirements For Granting Occupancy Certificate: No occupancy certificate shall be granted for
the use of any building or structure within a subdivision or lot division approved under this title until
storm water detention including restoration, underground utilities, streets up to the binder course,
street signs and streetlights are installed and operable.
4. Landscape/Second Lot Grading Survey Guarantee Deposit: In addition to any other fees payable at
the time that a certificate of occupancy shall be issued, there shall be deposited with the village,
cash adequate security in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per lot
which shall be known as the landscape/second lot grading survey guarantee deposit. The deposit
shall be in addition to any project performance bond or letter of credit previously established with
regard to the property. The purpose of this landscape/second lot grading survey guarantee deposit
shall be to assure that the individual lot has been properly graded and that the final landscaping
conforms to the approved grading plan. The village shall return the amount of the deposit or release
the amount of the security as soon as a second lot grading survey meeting the requirements of
subsection 8-1-6D of this chapter is submitted to and approved by the community development
department. The amount of the landscaping guarantee deposit shall be held or remain available for
the benefit of the village until approval by the village of the second lot grading survey. The village
shall notify the person depositing the landscape guarantee deposit of any specific defect existing in
the drainage of the lot. In the event that the defect is not corrected after reasonable notice, the
village may utilize the funds to correct the defect. Provided, however, that the utilization of this
grading guarantee deposit shall not prevent the village from taking other action against the person
responsible for the defect in drainage. Without regard to any other provision of this title, the village
shall not release the grading guarantee deposit until the entire area immediately affected by the
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 390/714
drainage characteristics of the individual lot shall have also been found to comply with the
ordinances of the village relating to drainage.
5. Occupancy Variance Deposit: A variance from any part of the requirements for the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for single-family lots may be granted by the village community development
director in light of an inability of the builder to complete such requirements due to inclement
weather or upon other good cause shown. When a variance is so issued, there shall be deposited
with the village a cash payment commensurate with the cost of the unfinished item(s) per lot, which
shall be known as the occupancy variance deposit. The purpose of this occupancy variance deposit
shall be to assure that the items not completed will be completed within sixty (60) days after the
weather, soil conditions or other impediment to completion allows for the uncompleted work to be
finished. The village shall hold the amount of the deposit until the work has been completed. In the
event that the defect is not corrected within the sixty (60) day period set forth above, the village
may, after reasonable notice to the individual or entity having so deposited said funds, utilize the
funds to correct the defect. Provided, however, that the utilization of this occupancy variance
deposit shall not prevent the village from taking other action against the person responsible for the
defect preventing the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, including, but not limited to, the filing
of a lawsuit for injunction, writ of mandamus, ordinance violation or the revocation of the occupancy
permit. Without regard to any provision contained within this title, the village shall not release the
occupancy variance deposit until the entire area immediately affected by the uncompleted items of
the individual lot shall have also been found to comply with the ordinances of the village. In the
event that the conditions of the occupancy variance and/or the conditions of the certificate of
occupancy are not satisfied, the village shall be entitled to take any action against the person
responsible for the defect preventing the compliance, including, but not limited to, the filing of a
lawsuit for injunction, writ of mandamus, ordinance violation or the revocation of the occupancy
permit.
B. Supplemental Requirements: Notwithstanding any provision within this chapter to the contrary, the
following conditions, improvements and supplemental documentation shall be required prior to the
issuance of a final occupancy certificate:
1. All fees and charges due and payable to the village shall be remitted.
2. Any replacement or repair to damaged curbs and gutters, streets, sidewalk, driveway and street
lighting shall be completed.
3. Address numbers clearly visible from the street shall be affixed to the building.
4. Applicant shall be in full compliance with all village codes.
5. The property owner of any/all buildings containing mechanical or meter rooms shall provide the
village with a set of keys to said room or rooms. In the event that the locks to these rooms are
changed, owner shall provide village with an updated set of keys to said room or rooms within
twelve (12) hours of said change. (Ord. 2008-O-005, 1-14-2008)

grounds justifying consideration of such application.

D. Hearing: The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on such application not more than
ninety (90) days after its filing. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted in accordance
with provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
E. Decisions: Not more than sixty (60) days after the close of the public hearing, the zoning board of
appeals shall, in writing, make its findings of fact and either approve, approve with conditions or deny
the application. The concurring vote of five (5) members of the board shall be necessary to grant a
variation. The zoning board of appeals shall then transmit a copy of its decision and findings of fact to
the applicant in accordance with the applicable statutes of the state of Illinois. The findings of fact
shall specify the reasons for the decision and the terms of the relief, if applicable, shall be specifically
set forth in a conclusion or statement separate from the findings of fact of the zoning board of
appeals.
1. Reconsideration: The village board may, through a motion passed by a majority of the village
board, request the zoning board of appeals to reconsider a case that has been denied in a new
public hearing.
F. Effective Period: No order of the zoning board of appeals granting a variation shall be valid for a period
longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of such order, unless a building permit is
obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a building is started or the use is
commenced within such period.
1. Extensions: The board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no more than one hundred
eighty (180) additional days, upon written application and good cause shown, without notice or
hearing.
2. Limitation: If any of the benefits conferred by a variation, whether heretofore or hereafter granted,
are abandoned, or are not utilized for any continuous period of one year, said variation shall, to the
extent of such abandonment or nonutilization, become valid only after a public hearing as provided
for herein.
G. Standards:
1. The zoning board of appeals shall not vary the provisions of this title authorized in this section,
unless: a) the variation is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title; and b) there
are practical difficulties or particular hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of any of the
regulations of this title relating to use, construction, or the alteration of buildings and structures, or
the use of land. In its consideration of the standards of practical difficulties or particular hardship,
the zoning board of appeals shall require evidence that:
a. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the
conditions allowed by the regulations in the particular zone;
b. The plight of the owner if due to unique circumstances; and
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 443/714
c. The variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality.
2. A variation shall be permitted only if the evidence, in the judgment of the zoning board of appeals,
sustains each of the three (3) conditions enumerated above.
3. For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the zoning board of appeals, in making this
determination, shall take into consideration, the extent to which the following facts, favorable to the
applicant, have been established by the evidence:
a. The particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property
involved will bring a particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
b. The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable generally to
other property within the same zone classification;
c. The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of
the property;
d. The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by any person presently having an
interest in the property;
e. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or unduly injurious to
other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; or
f. The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of air to adjacent property, or
substantially increase the danger of fire, or otherwise endanger the public safety or substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
H. Conditions: The zoning board of appeals may require such conditions and restrictions upon the
premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this
section to reduce or minimize the effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood,
and to implement the general purpose and intent of this title.
I. Effect Of Grant Of Variation: The grant of a variation shall not authorize the establishment or extension
of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
permits and approvals that may be required by this title or other ordinances of the village. (Ord. 2000-
O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-4-4: APPEALS:
A. Purpose: The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary, ill considered, or
erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to avoid the need for resort to legal action by
establishing local procedures to review and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended
as a means to subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this title or the rightful authority of
the zoning official to enforce the requirements of this title. To these ends, the reviewing body should
give all proper deference to the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this title and to the
reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with the administration of this title.
B. Authority: The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals from an administrative order,
requirement or determination under this title.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 444/714
C. Parties Entitled To Appeal: An appeal, in which it is alleged that there is error in any decision made by
the zoning official under this title, may be taken to the zoning board of appeals by any person or
governmental agency aggrieved by such decision or by any department, or officer of the village.
D. Filing: An appeal shall be taken within such time as shall be prescribed by the zoning board of appeals
by rule, by filing with the village clerk a notice of appeal in accordance with provisions of chapter 3 of
this title.
E. Stay Of Proceedings: An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the decision appealed
unless the zoning official certifies to the zoning board of appeals after the notice of the appeal has
been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed unless by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the zoning board of appeals or by a court of record on
application, on notice to the zoning official and on due cause shown.
F. Hearing: The zoning board of appeals shall hold a public hearing on such application not more than
ninety (90) days after its filing. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted in accordance
with provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
G. Decisions: The zoning board of appeals shall render a written decision on the appeal within a
reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the closing of the public hearings,
and shall promptly forward a copy of the decision of the parties.
1. The board may affirm or may, upon the concurrent vote of five (5) members, reverse, wholly or in
part, or modify the decision of the zoning official, as in its opinion ought to be done, and to that end
shall have the powers of the zoning official.
2. All decisions, after hearing of the board of appeals from the administrative order, requirement,
decision or determination of the zoning official shall, in all instances, be final administrative
determinations and shall be subject to judicial review only in accordance with applicable Illinois
statutes. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-4-5: SPECIAL USE PERMITS:
A. Purpose: This title is based upon the division of the village into districts, within which the use of land,
and the uses of bulk of buildings and structures, are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however,
that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, can only be properly
classified in any particular district or districts upon consideration in each case of the impact of those
uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location.
Such special uses fall into three (3) categories:
1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest; and
2. Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise
to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property, public facilities, or the
village as a whole; and
3. Uses, either public or private, that because of past or present conditions, need special
considerations.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 445/714
B. Authority: Special use permits shall be reviewed and heard by the planning commission, but only in
accordance with the requirements hereinafter set forth. The planning commission shall make their
recommendations to the village board.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Special Use Permits: An application for a special use permit may be initiated
by any person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a possessory interest entitled to
exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a freehold interest, an option to
purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest in which is specifically enforceable on the land which
is described in the application for the special use permit.
D. Application: An application for a special use permit shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of
chapter 3 of this title.
E. Hearing: The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on the application not more than ninety
(90) days after its filing. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted in accordance with
provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
F. Recommendation By The Planning Commission: Within sixty (60) days after the close of the hearing,
unless the applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the planning commission shall transmit
to the village board a written report giving its findings of fact of either approval, approval with
conditions or denial of the proposed special use in accordance with applicable statutes of the state of
Illinois.
1. The failure of the planning commission to act within such sixty (60) days, or such further time to
which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the denial of the special
use permit.
G. Decision Of The Village Board: Within sixty (60) days after the receipt of the recommendation of the
planning commission, or its failure to act as above provided, the village board shall either deny the
special use permit or, by ordinance duly adopted, grant the special use permit, with or without
modifications or conditions.
1. The failure of the board of trustees to act within such sixty (60) days, or such further time to which
the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a decision denying the special use permit.
2. Any proposed special use that fails to receive the approval of the planning commission shall not be
approved by the village board except by a favorable majority vote of all the village board members
then holding office.
3. In the event of written protest against any proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the
owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining the property proposed for a
special use, or by owners of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage across an alley or directly
opposite therefrom, such special use shall not be granted except by the favorable vote of five (5)
members of the village board.
H. Standards:
1. No special use permit may be granted unless:
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 446/714
a. The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or
endanger the public's health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare;
b. The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate
vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values
within the neighborhood;
c. The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and
improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district;
d. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary facilities have been or are
being provided;
e. Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to
minimize traffic congestion in the public streets;
f. The special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulation of the district in
which it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the board
pursuant to the recommendation of the planning commission; and
g. At least one year has elapsed since any denial by the village board of any prior application for a
special use permit that would have authorized substantially the same for all or part of the site,
unless the village board determines that conditions in the area have substantially changed;
2. For the purpose of supplementing the above standards, the planning commission, in making its
recommendation and the village board, in making its decision, may take into consideration, the
extent to which the following facts, favorable to the applicant, have been established by the
evidence:
a. The extent to which the proposed special use departs from the zoning and subdivision
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including, but not limited to, the density,
dimensions, area, bulk and uses, and the reasons why such departures are deemed to be in the
public interest;
b. In what respects the proposed special use meets the requirements and standards of the special
use regulations;
c. The method by which the proposed special use makes adequate provision for public services,
provides adequate control over vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated, common
open space and furthers the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
d. The relationship and compatibility of the proposed special use to adjacent properties and
neighborhoods;
e. The desirability of the proposed special use to physical development, tax base and economic
well being of the village; and
f. The conformity with the intent and spirit of the comprehensive plan of the village.
I. Conditions On Special Use Permits: The planning commission may recommend, and the board of
trustees may impose, such conditions and limitations concerning use, construction, character,
location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and objectives of this title
upon the premises benefited by a special use permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent
or minimize adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject
property or upon public facilities and services; provided, however, that such conditions shall not be
used as a device to grant a permit for a special use that is intended to be temporary in nature. Such
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 447/714
conditions shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting the special use. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this title and shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
special use permit.
J. Effect Of Issuance Of A Special Use Permit: The grant of a special use permit shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the titles and
ordinances of the village.
K. Limitations On Special Use Permits: Subject to an extension of time granted by the village board, no
special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months unless final building, site, and
engineering plans are submitted to the village for approval within such period. However, the planning
commission may extend this period up to, but not more than, one year, without notice or hearing,
provided such extension is granted for good cause shown.
1. A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued,
and such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such use shall,
for any reason, be discontinued or abandoned for a period of six (6) months and such use shall not
thereafter be reestablished unless a new special use permit is obtained.
2. Except when otherwise provided in this title granting a special use permit, a special use permit
shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the
owner or operator of such use or lot. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-4-6: PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS:
A. Purpose: The planned development technique is intended to allow the relaxation of otherwise
applicable substantive requirements based upon procedural protections providing for detailed review
of individual proposals for significant developments. This special regulatory technique is included in
this title in recognition of the fact that traditional use, bulk, space, and yard regulations that may be
useful in protecting the character of substantially developed and stable areas, may impose
inappropriately rigid regulations upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas that lend
themselves to an individually planned approach. Through the flexibility of the planned development
technique, the village seeks to achieve the specific objectives stated below. However, at no time is the
planned development intended to serve merely as a mechanism to subvert the underlying district
regulation and requirements.
1. The creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application
of other village land use regulations;
2. The efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets while lowering
development and housing costs;
3. The promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities resulting in
better design and development, including aesthetic amenities;
4. The combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms, and building relationships;
5. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics such as natural topography,
vegetation, and geologic features, and the prevention of soil erosion;
6. The provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space;
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 448/714
7. An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result from the application of
conventional subdivision and zoning regulations; and
8. The encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety and general welfare.
B. Authority: Planned developments are included in this title as a distinct category of special use and are
authorized in each zoning district for the same general purposes as all other special uses. The village
board, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this section and section 9-4-5 of
this chapter, may grant special use permits authorizing the development of planned developments.
C. Procedure:
1. Concept Plan: The concept plan is intended to provide the applicant an opportunity to submit a plan
showing the basic scope, character, and nature of entire proposed planned development without
incurring undue cost.
a. Application: Applications for approval of a concept plan shall be filed in accordance with the
provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
b. Administrative Review: Upon receipt of a completed application for approval of a concept plan,
the zoning official shall schedule a review of the concept plan before the concept review team.
c. Recommendation By The Concept Review Team: After the administrative review of the concept
plan, unless the applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the concept review team shall
make a written report giving its findings and recommendations of changes, if any, to the concept
plan.
2. Preliminary Plan:
a. Purpose: The preliminary plan is the basis, on which the required public hearing is held, thus
permitting public consideration of the proposal. To permit the village and the applicant to proceed
with some assurance, approval of the preliminary plan binds the applicant and the village with
respect to the following basic elements of development:
(1) Categories of uses to be permitted;
(2) General location of residential and nonresidential land uses;
(3) Overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of nonresidential uses;
(4) The general architectural style of the proposed development;
(5) General location and extent of public and private open space, including recreational
amenities;
(6) General location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems;
(7) Staging of development; and
(8) Nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements, or contributions to be
provided by the applicant.
b. Application: After receipt of the concept review team's written report, the applicant shall file an
application for approval of a preliminary plan in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3 of
this title.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 449/714
c. Hearing: The application for approval of a preliminary plan shall then be reviewed by staff, the
village's consultants and other relevant agencies, after which the planning commission shall hold
a public hearing on the application. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted in
accordance with provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
d. Recommendation By The Planning Commission: After the close of the hearing, unless the
applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the planning commission shall transmit to the
village board a written report giving its findings and recommendations of denial or approval, with
or without modifications or conditions, of the preliminary plan.
e. Decision Of The Village Board: After the receipt of the recommendation of the planning
commission, the village board shall either:
(1) Deny the preliminary plan; or
(2) Shall refer it back to the planning commission for further consideration of specified matters; or
(3) Approve the preliminary plan, with or without modifications or conditions to be accepted by
the applicant as a condition of such approval.
3. Final Plan:
a. Purpose: The final plan is intended to particularize, refine, and implement the preliminary plan
and to serve as a complete, thorough, and permanent public record of the planned development
and the manner in which it is to be developed.
b. Application: After approval of the preliminary plan, the applicant shall file an application for
approval of a final plan in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3 of this title. The application
may include the entire area included in the approved preliminary plan or one or more stages or
units thereof in accordance with the staging plan, if any, approved as part of the preliminary plan.
The application shall refine, implement, and be in substantial conformity with the approved
preliminary plan.
c. Public Meeting: The planning commission shall review the application for final plan approval at a
regularly scheduled public meeting.
d. Recommendation By Planning Commission: After review of the final plan, the planning
commission shall transmit to the village board a written report giving its findings and
recommendations of denial or approval, with or without modifications or conditions, of the final
plan.
e. Action By Village Board:
(1) After the receipt of the recommendation of the planning commission, or its failure to act as
above provided, the village board shall either:
(A) Deny the final plan; or
(B) Shall refer it back to the planning commission for further consideration of specified matters;
or
(C) Approve the final plan, with or without modifications or conditions to be accepted by the
applicant as a condition of such approval.
(2) In approving the final plan, the village board shall grant a special use permit authorizing the
proposed planned development.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 450/714
f. Recording Of Final Plan: When a final plan is approved, the zoning official shall cause the final
plan, or such portions thereof as are appropriate, to be recorded with the county recorder of
deeds. No zoning certificate or other permit, allowing construction of a building or other
development, shall take place until the required recording of the final plat. All recording costs
shall be paid by the applicant.
g. Limitation On Final Plan Approval: Construction shall commence in accordance with the
approved final plan within one year after the approval of such final plan, or within such shorter
time as may be established by the approved development schedule. Failure to commence
construction within such period shall, unless an extension of time shall have been granted by the
village board, automatically render void the final plan approval and all approvals of the planned
development and all permits based on such approvals, and the zoning official shall, without
further direction, initiate an appropriate application to revoke the special use permit for all
portions of the planned development that have not yet been completed.
D. Standards For Planned Development Approval: No special use permit for a planned development
shall be favorably recommended or granted pursuant to this section unless the applicant shall
establish that the proposed development will meet each of the standards made applicable to special
uses pursuant to section 9-4-5 of this chapter. In addition, no special use permit for a planned
development shall be favorably recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish that the
proposed development will meet each of the following additional standards:
1. Comprehensive Plan: A planned development must conform to the intent and spirit of the
comprehensive plan of the village.
2. Site: The site of a planned development must be under single ownership and/or unified control at
the time of development.
3. Compatibility: The uses permitted in a planned development must be a type and so located as to
exercise no undue detrimental influence upon surrounding properties.
4. Need: A clear showing of need for the proposed use(s) must be made.
5. Yards: The required yards along the periphery of the planned development shall be at least equal
in width or depth to that of the adjacent zoning district.
6. Parking Requirements: Adequate parking shall be provided and in no event shall the parking be
less than that provided for in other sections of this title. Parking for residential use shall not be less
than two (2) spaces per dwelling unit.
7. Traffic: Adequate provision shall be made to provide ingress and egress so designed as to
minimize traffic congestion in the public street.
8. Design Standards: The provisions of the subdivision and plat ordinance of the village shall be
adhered to, unless a waiver is granted by the village board.
E. Authority To Vary Regulations: The village board shall have the authority, in connection with the
granting of any planned development approval pursuant to this section, to change, alter, vary, modify
or waive any provisions of this title or of the subdivision and plat ordinance as they apply to an
approved planned development.
1. Standards: No such change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver shall be approved unless
the village board shall find that the proposed planned development:
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 451/714
a. Will achieve the purposes for which planned developments may be approved pursuant to the
requirements of this section;
b. Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this title and the village's
comprehensive plan; and
c. Will result in a development providing compensating amenities to the village.
2. Specific Limitations: In granting approval of any planned development, the village board shall in no
event:
a. Reduce the number of off street parking and loading spaces required by the title for any use by
more than twenty five percent (25%); or
b. Reduce the minimum lot area requirements applicable in any district in which the development is
to be located by more than twenty five percent (25%); or
c. Increase the maximum floor area ratio applicable in any district in which the development is to be
located by more than twenty five percent (25%); or
d. Permit the total lot coverage in the planned development to exceed sixty percent (60%) when
located in a residential district; or
e. Reduce the minimum yard requirements applicable in any district in which the development is to
be located by more than twenty five percent (25%).
F. Conditions On Planned Development Approval: The approval of either a preliminary plan or a final plan
may be conditioned on such matters as the village board may find necessary to prevent or minimize
any possible adverse effects of the proposed planned development or to ensure its compatibility with
surrounding uses and development and its consistency with the general purposes, goals, and
objectives of this title, the subdivision and plat ordinance, and the official comprehensive plan.
G. Regulation During And Following Completion Of Development: Following final plan approval, the final
plan, rather than any other provision of this title, shall constitute the use, parking, loading, sign, bulk,
space, and yard regulations applicable to the subject property, and no use or development, other than
home occupation and temporary uses, not allowed by the final plan shall be permitted within the area
of the planned development pursuant to the zoning district regulations otherwise applicable to such
area.
H. Adjustments To Final Plan During Development:
1. Minor Adjustments: During build out of a planned development, the zoning official may authorize
minor adjustments to the final plan when such adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or
engineering considerations first discovered during actual development. Such minor adjustments
shall be limited to the following:
a. Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures by not more than fifteen percent
(15%) or twenty feet (20') whichever is greater of the distance shown on the approved final plan
between such structure or structures and any other structure or any vehicular circulation element
or any boundary of the planned development, whichever is less; and
b. Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than fifteen percent (15%) or twenty
feet (20') whichever is greater of the distance shown on the approved final plan between such
circulation element and any structure, whichever is less; and
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 452/714
c. Altering the location of any open space by not more than twenty five percent (25%); and
d. Altering any final grade by not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the originally planned grade;
and
e. Altering the location or type of landscaping elements.
f. All minor adjustments shall be consistent with the intent of this title and the final plan, and shall be
the minimum necessary to overcome the particular difficulty.
2. Major Adjustments: Any adjustment to the final plan not authorized by subsection H1 of this
section, shall be considered to be a major adjustment and shall be granted only upon application to,
and approval by, the village board. The village board may, by ordinance duly adopted, grant
approval for a major adjustment without a hearing upon finding that any changes in the final plan as
approved will be in substantial conformity with said final plan. If the village board determines that a
major adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the final plan as approved, then the village
board shall refer the request to the planning commission for further hearing and review as provided
in subsection C2c of this section. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-4-7: AMENDMENTS:
A. Purpose: The amendment process established by this section, is intended to provide a means for
making changes in the text of this code and in the zoning map that have more or less general

map in light of changing newly discovered or newly important conditions, situations or knowledge.
B. Authority: The regulations and districts established by this title, may be amended from time to time,
subject to the procedures set forth herein, by the village board through the enactment of an amending
ordinance.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Amendments: Amendments may be proposed by the village board, the
planning commission, and by any other person, firm or corporation having a freehold interest, a
possessory interest entitled to exclusive possession, a contractual interest which may become a
freehold interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest in which is specifically
enforceable on the land which is described in the application for an amendment.
D. Procedure: The procedure for obtaining an amendment shall be as follows:

receiving the application from the zoning official. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted in accordance with provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
3. Recommendation Of The Planning Commission: The planning commission shall, within sixty (60)
days after the hearing, transmit a written report giving its findings and recommendations to the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 453/714
presented to it in each specified case with respect to the following matters:
(1) Existing uses of property within the general area of the property in question;
(2) The zoning classification of property within the general area of the property in question;
(3) The suitability of the property in question for the use permitted under the existing zoning
classification;
(4) The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in question, including

in its present zoning classification; and
(5) Conformance or nonconformance with officially adopted plans of the village.
b. The planning commission shall not recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment unless it
finds that the adoption of such an amendment is in the public interest and is not solely for the
interest of the applicant. The planning commission may recommend the adoption of an
amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any different
classification than that requested by the applicant.
E. Decisions: The village board, upon recommendation of the planning commission, may either grant
proposed amendment, with or without modifications, or deny any proposed amendment in

owner of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage proposed to be altered or by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) of the frontage immediately adjoining or across an alley therefrom, or by the owners
of twenty percent (20%) of the frontage directly opposite the frontage proposed to be altered, such
amendment shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of two-thirds (2/3) trustee's of the
village then holding office.
2. If no action is taken by the village board within ninety (90) days after the report of the planning
commission, or such further time as the applicant may agree, the application shall be deemed to
have been denied and shall not thereafter be granted.

9-4-8: ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS:
A. Purpose: The interpretation authority established herein is intended to recognize that the provisions of
this title, though detailed and lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they
may have to be applied. Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed by an
interpretation of the specific provisions of this title in light of the general and specific purposes for
which those provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority herein established is
an administrative rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential
content of this title but rather is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to
specific cases.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 454/714
B. Authority: The zoning official, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations set forth herein,
may render interpretations, including use interpretations, of the provisions of this title and of any rule
or regulation issued pursuant to it.
C. Parties Entitled To Seek Interpretations: Applications for interpretations may be filed by any person
having an interest in the circumstances giving rise to the need for an interpretation; provided,
however, that interpretations shall not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical facts or
where the interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
D. Procedure:
1. Application: Applications for interpretations of this code shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of chapter 3 of this title.
2. Action On Application: Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a properly completed application
for interpretation, the zoning official shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her interpretation,
stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the determination is based. The
failure of the zoning official to act within thirty (30) days, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying the application rendered on the day following
such thirty (30) day period.
3. Appeal: Appeals from interpretations rendered by the zoning official may be taken to the zoning
board of appeals as provided in section 9-4-4 of this chapter.
E. Standards For Use Interpretations:
1. The following standards shall govern the zoning official, and the zoning board of appeals on
appeals from the zoning official, in issuing a use interpretation:
a. Any use defined in chapter 20 of this title shall be interpreted as therein defined;
b. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless evidence shall be presented that
demonstrates that it will comply with the general district regulations established for that particular
district;
c. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a district unless such use is similar to other uses
permitted in the district and is more similar to those uses than to uses permitted in a less
restrictive district;
d. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special use in the district in which
it is proposed to be located, then any interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on
the issuance of a special use permit for such use pursuant to section 9-4-5 of this chapter; and
e. No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with
the statement of purpose of the district in question.
2. No use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular
district shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months after the date of issue unless a building
permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently
pursued to completion, or a zoning certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced
within that period.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 455/714
3. A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular
district shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for which it was issued, and such permit
shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use interpretation
has not been issued. Such permit shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if
the particular use for which it was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six
(6) consecutive months or more.
F. Effect Of Interpretation: No interpretation, including a use interpretation finding a particular use to be
permitted or specially permitted in a particular district, shall authorize the establishment of such use
nor the development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure,
but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals that may be required by the titles and ordinances of the village. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-
2000)
9-4-9: HISTORIC PRESERVATION:

commission on its own initiative, may request landmark designation for any improvement which is
located within the corporate limits of the village and which may have historic significance as set
forth in the criteria for evaluation. No such person, group of persons or association, nor the
commission, shall be required to obtain the consent of the owner of the improvement prior to filing
the application for landmark designation, nor shall the owner's consent be required as a condition of
designation itself.
2. Application: An application for a landmark designation shall be filed in accordance with the
provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
a. The person, group of persons or association submitting the application for landmark designation,
including the commission when acting on its own initiative, shall bear all costs of and pay all fees
required in connection with said application.
3. Hearing: The planning commission shall hold a public hearing on such application not more than
sixty (60) days after its filing. The public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted in accordance
with provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
a. Review: Prior to the public hearing on the application for landmark designation, the commission
shall conduct a study of the improvement proposed for landmark designation and make a report
containing preliminary findings on the historic, architectural and aesthetic significance of the
improvement.

published notices shall contain the number assigned to the application, the place, the nature, the
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

(60) days of receipt by the planning commission of the application for landmark designation.
5. Decision Of The Village Board: Within one hundred twenty (120) days of the filing of the
application, the village board, by ordinance, shall grant or deny the application for landmark
designation. If the village board approves the application for landmark designation, a notice of the
designation will be sent by the zoning official to the applicant and the owner of the improvement
and a copy of the ordinance effectuating the designation shall be recorded with the appropriate
county recorder of deeds and with the appropriate township assessor.
6. Limitations: During the period beginning with the filing of an application for landmark designation
and ending with the final action of the village board granting or denying said application, no exterior
architectural feature of any improvement which is subject to an application for landmark designation
may undergo alteration, construction, demolition or removal if such alteration, construction,
demolition or removal would be subject to the issuance of a permit after designation. Nothing in this
subsection shall operate to bar ordinary maintenance or any work that is necessary to prevent or
correct an imminently dangerous or hazardous condition.
7. Listing: A list of landmarks shall be maintained and available at the zoning official's office.
8. Standards For Designation: The planning commission shall not recommend, nor shall the village
board grant a designation of a landmark unless it makes findings based upon the evidence
presented to it, in each specific case, that the proposed landmark meets the following
requirements:
a. That it is located within the C-4 traditional downtown district and the corporate boundaries of the
village; and
b. That it is over thirty (30) years old, in whole or in part; and
c. That one or more of the following conditions exists:
(1) That it may identify with an historic personage or with important events in national, state or
local history;
(2) That it may embody the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type inherently
valuable for a study of a period, style, method of construction, or use of indigenous materials or
craftsmanship;

(4) That it may be an improvement embodying all or part of the above characteristics, which is
subject to encroachment of detrimental influences; and
(5) That it may be an improvement of historic, architectural, or cultural significance, which is
threatened with demolition by public or private action;
d. That it possesses integrity of design, materials, workmanship, setting, location, feeling and
association; and
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 457/714
e. That it embodies such other qualities and characteristics as in the judgment of the commission
should be considered for the designation of a landmark.
D. Landmark Construction Or Alteration: Except as otherwise provided in this title, it shall be unlawful for
any person to construct, alter, demolish or remove the exterior or any aspect of the exterior of any
landmark located within the C-4 district, or to construct an improvement located within the C-4 district
unless the planning commission has previously authorized issuance of a building permit authorizing
such work. Authorization by the village board shall not be required for ordinary repair and
maintenance.
1. Procedures For Authorization Of A Building Permit:
a. Applications: All applications for a building permit or a demolition permit for the alteration,
demolition, construction or removal of a designated landmark located within the C-4 district shall
be reviewed by the planning commission and approved by the board of trustees. The application
shall be filed with the building department, which shall transmit a copy of the application for the
building or demolition permit to the commissioner. No additional costs shall be imposed for the
application for certificate of appropriateness.
(1) The application shall include plans and specifications for the proposed work, or such other
statement of the proposed work as is acceptable to the building department under the building
or other applicable codes. The application shall also include such other information as the
commission may, by rule, require from time to time.
b. Decision: The zoning official shall notify the applicant and the owner of the improvement of the
village board's decision to grant or deny the application. In making its determinations, the
commission and board of trustees shall be sensitive to and shall consider the effect that the
issuance of a permit may have on energy conservation. In no instance shall the village board
unreasonably withhold the approval of a request for a permit.
(1) Within fourteen (14) days after the authorization to grant a permit by the village board, the
building department shall issue said permit. The applicant shall not proceed to perform any of
the work requested until all other required permits have been obtained.
(2) A grant of a permit shall be authorized by the board of trustees upon a finding by it that all
reasonable use of, or return from, a designated landmark or property within the C-4 district
would be denied a property owner as a result of the disapproval of a permit.
c. Conduct Of Hearing: The commission and board of trustees may solicit expert testimony, or the
applicant may submit evidence, concerning any of the following items at the time of the public
hearing on the certificate of appropriateness:
(1) Any substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property as a result of the denial of a
permit;
(2) Any substantial decrease in the pretax or after tax return to owners of record or other
investors in the property as a result of the denial of a permit;
(3) Any additional cost of work necessary to comply with the standards and criteria for the
issuance of a permit; and
(4) In the case of a proposed demolition, the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the
existing structure on the property.
d. Fees: The person applying for a permit shall bear all costs of and pay all fees required in
connection with said application and said request.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 458/714
e. Standards For The Grant Of Issuance Of A Permit: The planning commission shall apply and
make findings pertaining to the following general criteria when considering a request for a permit:
(1) The effect of the proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or affecting the exterior
architectural features of the improvement upon which such work is to be done;
(2) The relationship between the results of such work and the exterior architectural features of
other, neighboring improvements in the C-4 district or in the area of the landmark;
(3) The aesthetic, historical and architectural values and significance, and the architectural style,
design, arrangement and material of the existing improvement and the work proposed to be
done;
(4) The effects of the result of such work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and
use of the exterior architectural features of the improvement which cause it to possess a
special character or special historical, architectural or aesthetic interest or value; and
(5) The relationship between the proposed work and the objective and design criteria established
for the C-4 district by the "Traditional Downtown Mokena Design Manual" on file at the office of
the zoning official.
E. Ordinary Maintenance: Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance
or repair of any exterior feature of any improvement designated a landmark or any improvement
located within the C-4 district which does not involve change in such improvement's design or
materials, or in any exterior architectural feature of the improvement.
F. Maintenance And Repair Required: Neither the owner of, nor the person in charge of, an improvement
designated a landmark or an improvement located within the C-4 district shall permit such
improvement to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the deterioration of any exterior
appurtenance or architectural feature so as to produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of the
zoning official, a detrimental effect upon the character of the C-4 district as a whole or the life and
character of the improvement in question, including, but not limited to:
1. The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;
2. The deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;
3. The deterioration of exterior chimneys;
4. The deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster or mortar;
5. The ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and foundations, including broken windows or
doors; and
6. The deterioration of any feature so as to create or permit the creation of any hazardous or unsafe
condition or conditions.
G. Remedying Of Dangerous Conditions:
1. In any case where the building department, or any officer or agency of the village, or any court on
application or at the insistence of any such department, officer or agency, shall direct the
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any improvement designated a landmark or
any improvement located within the C-4 district, or the performance of any minor work upon such
improvement, for the purpose of remedying conditions determined to be dangerous to life, health or
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 459/714
property, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as making it unlawful for any person, without
prior issuance of a permit, to comply with such order or direction.
2. In the case of unusual circumstances whereby the normal process for obtaining a permit as set
forth in this section will jeopardize the health, safety and welfare of any person, the village board of
trustees may, at its discretion, waive the normal process and immediately grant the permit, stating
in writing its reasons for such immediate approval.
H. Demolition By Natural Causes: For the purposes of this section, complete natural demolition shall
occur when an improvement is damaged by fire, collapse, explosion, or other casualty or act of God
to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence shall
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the improvement at the time of the demolition.
Partial natural demolition shall occur when an improvement is damaged by fire, collapse, explosion,
or other casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of restoration to the condition in which it was
before the occurrence shall be less than fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the
improvement at the time of the demolition or destruction.
I. Extension Of Time For Action: Whenever, under the provisions of this section, the planning
commission, the village board or any applicant is required or authorized, within a prescribed period of
time, to make any determination or perform any act in relation to any request for a permit, the
applicant may extend such period of time by his written consent filed with the planning commission.
Any such extension of time may be suggested or initiated by the village board, the planning
commission or the applicant.
J. Acquisition Of Appropriate Protective Interests: The village may acquire, by purchase, donation or
condemnation, appropriate protective interests in any landmark or any improvement located within an
historic preservation district within the corporate boundaries of the village, whenever and to the extent
that the village, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, determines that the
acquisition will be in the public interest. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-4-10: TEMPORARY USE PERMITS:
A. Authority: The zoning official is authorized by this title to issue a temporary use permit for uses
specifically authorized in particular zoning districts as temporary uses as set forth in chapter 14 of this
title.
B. Application: An application for a temporary use permit shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of chapter 3 of this title.
C. Hearing: The zoning official may, if he so desires, hold a public hearing on the request for a temporary

of the use. The public hearing, if any, shall be set, noticed, and conducted in accordance with
provisions of chapter 3 of this title.
D. Decision: The zoning official shall render a written decision on the application for a temporary use
permit within a reasonable time and promptly forward a copy of the decision to the petitioner.

Chapter 5
NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
9-5-1: PURPOSE:
A. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming buildings, structures and
uses, and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings,
structures and uses may be continued.
B. The zoning districts established by this title are designed to guide the future use of land within the
village by encouraging the development and maintenance of desirable residential, business, office,
institutional and industrial areas, as well as to promote and protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare. The continued existence of nonconforming uses and structures is frequently
inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual
elimination of such nonconforming uses and structures is generally desirable. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-
14-2000)
9-5-2: SCOPE OF REGULATIONS:
A. This chapter establishes separate restrictions for the following categories of nonconformity:
1. Nonconforming uses;
2. Nonconforming structures;
3. Nonconforming uses of land; and
4. Nonconforming lots of record.
B. The degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the
degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with
nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to section 9-4-3 of this title, provision is made for relief from
some of the restrictions of this chapter when practical difficulties or particular hardship exists. (Ord.
2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-5-3: NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES:
No accessory use or structure that is devoted to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 461/714
after such principal nonconforming use or structure has been terminated, unless it shall thereafter
conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-5-4: BURDEN OF OWNER TO ESTABLISH LEGALITY OF NONCONFORMITY:
The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is lawfully existing under the provisions of this chapter
shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of the nonconforming property and not upon the village. (Ord.
2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-5-5: NONCONFORMING USES:
A. Authority To Continue: Except as provided in subsection I of this section, any lawfully existing
nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the
regulations contained herein and in sections 9-5-3 and 9-5-4 of this chapter.
B. Ordinary Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and
installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may
be performed on any structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use; provided,
however, that this subsection, shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of this section.
1. A building in a residential district containing a nonconforming use may be repaired or altered to
improve livable and health conditions, provided no changes or are made that would increase the
number of dwelling units or the bulk of the building.
C. Structural Alteration: No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be
structurally altered unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
D. Enlargement Of Structure: No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be
enlarged or added to in any manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the use of
such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located.
E. Extension Of Use: No nonconforming use shall be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in
intensity except that a nonconforming use located in a structure not designed or intended for any use
permitted in the district in which such structure is located may be extended throughout any part of
such structure lawfully existing on the effective date of this title or any amendment thereto that causes
such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such extension shall not be allowed
unless off street parking and loading spaces required for such extension can be, and are, provided in
accordance with the requirements and restrictions of chapter 16 of this title. No such extension shall
be deemed to affect the duty to terminate such use pursuant to this section. The extensions,
expansions, enlargements, and increases in intensity prohibited by this subsection shall include,
without being limited to:
1. Any extension of such use, including its accessory uses, to any structure or land area other than
that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this title or any amendment
hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming; and
2. Except as expressly permitted above, any extension of such use, including its accessory uses,
within a building to any portion of floor area that was not occupied by such nonconforming use on
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 462/714
the effective date of this title or any amendment thereto that causes such use to become
nonconforming; and
3. Any extension of the hours of operation of such use beyond the normal hours of operation on the
effective date of this title or any amendment thereto that causes such use to become
nonconforming.
F. Moving: No structure devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in
part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire
structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it
is located after being so moved.
G. Change In Use: No nonconforming use shall be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the
zoning district in which the use is located. When such a nonconforming use has been changed to a
permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use. For purposes of this
subsection, a use shall be deemed to have been so changed when an existing nonconforming use
shall have been terminated and a permitted use shall have commenced and continued for a period of
five (5) days. Any change of use in violation of this section shall be deemed to be an abandonment of
the lawfully existing nonconforming use.
H. Damage Or Destruction: Any structure devoted in whole or in part to, or that is accessory to, a
nonconforming use that is damaged or destroyed, by any means not within control of the owner, to
the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of replacement of such structure new, shall not
be restored unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located. Such restoration shall not create any new nonconformity or
increasing the degree of any nonconformity existing prior to such damage or destruction. In
determining whether a parking or loading nonconformity has been created or increased, the
provisions of chapter 16 of this title shall control.
I. Termination By Discontinuance Or Abandonment: When a nonconforming use is discontinued or
abandoned for a period of one year, regardless of any intent to resume or not to abandon such use,
such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such
land or structure shall comply with the use regulations of the zoning district in which such land or
structure is located. Any period of such discontinuance caused by government action, strikes,
material shortages, or acts of God, and without any contributing fault by the nonconforming user, shall
not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of this section. (Ord. 2000-
O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-5-6: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A. Authority To Continue: Any nonconforming structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the restrictions in this section and sections 9-5-3 and 9-5-4 of this chapter.
B. Ordinary Repair And Maintenance: Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and
installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may
be performed on any nonconforming structure; provided, however, that this subsection, shall not be
deemed to authorize any violation of this section.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 463/714
C. Structural Alteration: No nonconforming structure shall be structurally altered unless the structure shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

1, I-2, or O-2 zoning district.
E. Collocation:
1. The village of Mokena encourages collocation of wireless communications service facilities on
existing or planned wireless communications service facilities in order to minimize the proliferation
of antenna support structures and to achieve the most efficient use of land within the community.
Therefore, the village may grant access to municipally owned property and may lower or waive
application fees for applicants locating additional antennas on an existing facility. In addition, a
height bonus may be granted to an applicant that incorporates two (2) or more antennas upon the
applicant's facility, however, no facility shall exceed a height of one hundred fifty feet (150'). (Ord.
2000-O-005, 2-14-2000; amd. Ord. 2002-O-011, 5-28-2002; Ord. 2009-O-006, 2-23-2009)
2. When asking for additional height, an applicant shall provide documentation from a professional
engineer licensed in the state of Illinois showing that the proposed antenna cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved facility within a one-fourth (1/4) mile search for facilities
under one hundred fifty feet (150') in height for one or more of the following reasons:
a. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or approved facility,
and the existing or approved facility cannot be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate
the planned equipment at a reasonable cost;
b. The planned equipment would cause interference materially impacting other service providers,
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
c. An existing or approved facility within the search area cannot accommodate the planned
equipment at a height necessary to provide service to the applicant's service area; or
d. Other unforeseen reasons make the subject site of practical necessity for the applicant. (Ord.

and specifications approved and made part of the application for the installation of a wireless
communications service facility. Noncompliance, including, but not limited to, discoloration, cracking,
missing components, rusting, settling, damage or general disrepair shall be deemed a violation of this
title and shall subject the owner of the facility and the owner of a host building or structure, if different,
to the remedies and penalties set forth in chapter 19 of this title. Liability for such noncompliance shall
be joint and several for the owner or owners of a facility and an owner or owners of a host building or
structure, if different.
G. Abandonment: Abandoned, obsolescent, or unused wireless communications service facilities or
portions thereof shall be removed within three (3) months of notice to the FCC of intent to cease
operations at a site, unless an extension is granted by the zoning official. In the event that a wireless
communications service facility, or portion thereof, is not removed within three (3) months of such
notice, or other agreed time, the village may, in addition to any other remedy provided by this title,
remove the facility or portion thereof, at the applicant's expense. Unused portions of a wireless
communications service tower above a manufactured connection shall be removed within two (2)
months of the time of antenna relocation. The replacement of portions of a tower previously removed
requires the issuance of a new permit. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000; amd. Ord. 2002-O-011, 5-28-

9-17-5: DESIGN CRITERIA:
Landscape plans described above shall be based on the following design criteria. The evaluation and
approval shall also be based on these design criteria:
A. Scale And Nature Of Landscaping Material: The scale and nature of landscaping materials should be
appropriate to the size of structures. Large scaled buildings, for example, should generally be
complemented by larger scaled plants. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
B. Selection Of Plant Material: Plant material should be selected for its form, texture, color and with
concern for its ultimate growth. The use of silver maples, box elders, Russian olives, Chinese elm,
willows, ashes, poplars, and other weak wooded species shall not be planted in the public right of
way. (Ord. 2011-O-015, 8-8-2011)
C. Evergreens: Evergreens (a plant with foliage that persists and remains green year round) should be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site, particularly in those areas screening parking lots
from dedicated public rights of way or property zoned for residential use.
D. Shade Trees: All shade trees (large deciduous trees, which shed their foliage annually, planted
primarily for their high crown of foliage or overhead canopy) shall have a minimum trunk size of two
and one-half inches (21/2") in diameter upon installation, as measured six inches (6") above the
established ground level.
E. Ornamental Trees: Ornamental trees (lower growing deciduous trees reaching a height of 25 feet at
maturity) may in some cases be substituted for shade trees at the discretion of the zoning official or
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 554/714
his designee. These trees may be single or multiple trunk specimen plants providing screening and
seasonal interest with attractive fruit, flowers and trunks or branching.
F. Shrubs: Shrubs (plants which are from 3 to 6 feet in height at maturity and branch to the ground) may
be used to supplement the other plant material in the landscape plan. These plants are used primarily
for screening of parking lot or other unsightliness and may be either deciduous or evergreen. The use
of these plants shall not be substituted for other plant material required in this title, unless authorized
by the zoning official or his designee.
G. Softening Of Walls And Fences: Plant material should be placed intermittently against long expanses
of building walls, fences and other barriers to create a softening effect.
H. Planting Beds: Planting beds are areas within the landscape in which the growth of plant material will
be fostered. All planting beds should be mulched with shredded bark mulch or similar material to a
two inch (2") depth.
I. Detention Basins: Detention basins (areas on site designed to hold site stormwater runoff) shall be
landscaped. Such landscaping should include shade and ornamental trees, evergreen, shrubbery,
hedges and/or other plant material that can periodically be inundated with water.
J. Retention Ponds: Retention ponds (areas on site designed to collect stormwater runoff and release it
at a predetermined rate so as to not overload or adversely impact surrounding properties) shall be
landscaped. Such landscaping should include shade and ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubbery,
hedges and/or other plant material that can periodically be inundated with water.
K. Energy Conservation:
1. Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from
the summer sun; and
2. Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the north side of buildings to
dissipate the effect of winter winds.
L. Preservation Of Existing Plant Material: Existing plant material should, wherever practical as
determined by the zoning official or his designee, be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a
site.
M. Berming: Earthen berms (raised earth formations constructed on site to create more variety and
interest in the landscape) should be used in conjunction with the existing topography, whenever
determined practical by the zoning official, or his designee, and the village engineer. Incorporating
berms in the landscape treatment of a site, particularly when combined with plant material to facilitate
screening is encouraged. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000)
9-17-6: RIGHT OF WAY LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING:
A. Applicability: Where a parcel abuts a dedicated public right of way or private street, landscaping shall

expansions that may occur. No trees shall be planted closer than thirty feet (30') from the right of
way line at an intersection or closer than ten feet (10') from any driveway, streetlight or fire hydrant.
The exact location of such trees will be left to the discretion of the zoning official or his designee.
(Ord. 2011-O-015, 8-8-2011)
4. Size: Parkway trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two and one-half inches (21/2") in diameter,
as measured six inches (6") above the established ground level, at time of installation.
5. Buffering: Properties adjacent to but not fronting state or county routes or streets designed as
arterial or collector roads within the village shall provide a landscaped buffer abutting that road. The
landscaped buffer shall include, but not be limited to, trees, berms, shrubs and ground cover and

external artificial light source, exceed one hundred (100) foot-lamberts at the sign face. All artificial
illumination shall be so designed, located, shielded, and directed as to prevent the casting of direct
light upon adjacent property or streets. No exposed reflective type bulb or incandescent lamp which
exceeds fifteen watts (15 W) shall be used on the exterior surface of any sign so as to expose the
face of the bulb, light or lamp to any public street or adjacent property. All sources of light, whether

a Residential District.
3. Signs Adjacent To Residential Areas: Signs located on a lot abutting a Residential District or a sign
within one hundred feet (100') of any Residentially zoned area shall be so designed, located,
shielded, and directed so as to prevent the casting of direct light upon adjacent properties or
streets.
E. Sign Area Computation: The following principles shall control the computation of sign area:
1. Computation Of Area Of Individual Signs: The area of a sign face shall be computed by means of
the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background or the display or used to differentiate
the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any supporting
framework or bracing unless such framework or bracing is made part of the message or face of the
sign.
2. Computation Of Area Of Multiple Faced Signs: The sign area for a sign with more than one face
shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When
two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any
point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not
more than forty two inches (42") apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one
of the faces.
F. Construction And Design Standards: All signs shall meet the construction and design standards set
forth for signs in the Village's Building Code.

feet of landscape area. (Ord. 2000-O-005, 2-14-2000; amd. Ord. 2019-O-26, 7-8-2019)
2. Any monument sign constructed or erected to a height in excess of eight feet (8') above the crown
of the abutting road, or, in the event that the abutting road has a median, the average height of the
top of the curb as measured on each side of the median shall be required to be improved with an
additional one and one-half (11/2) square feet of landscaped area for each foot of height or portion
thereof that said sign is constructed or erected above said eight feet (8') in height. (Ord. 2004-O-
053, 11-22-2004; amd. Ord. 2019-O-26, 7-8-2019)

the entire development, as required for the proposed public improvements, in accordance with
the fee table set forth in subsection C1 of this section, shall be paid upon submittal of the
preliminary plan.
b. As each phase is submitted for final plan approval, that percentage of the figure as determined
based upon the letter of credit amount for the entire development, in accordance with the fee
table set forth in subsection C1 of this section to which the value of the submitted phase
corresponds, shall be paid prior to final plan approval for that phase.
Example: Letters of credit amount for public improvements for entire development:
$1,000,000.00.
Total review fee $17,950.00
Calculated as follows:
Initial fee (20%) $ 3,590.00
Phase I final review fee $500,000.00 7,180.00

$17,950.00
c. Should the actual letter of credit amount not be available at the time of submittal of the
preliminary plan, the developer shall submit as a substitute therefor, an engineer's opinion of
probable construction cost for the proposed public improvements for the entire development.
Upon approval by the village engineer, such opinion shall be utilized as the basis for calculating
the review fees. Such fees shall be adjusted in accordance with the letter of credit amount when
finally determined. Should additional fees be required, they shall be apportioned equally to any
remaining payments contemplated under the payment schedule set forth in subsection C2b of
this section. If the final letter of credit amount is less than the initial estimate as submitted by the
developer, the initial estimate shall be utilized unless the difference between the initial estimate
and the final letter of credit amount is greater than twenty five percent (25%), in which case the
village shall refund that amount of the difference in excess of twenty five percent (25%).
D. Inspection Fees: All planned developments which contemplate the construction and/or dedication of
public improvements shall have such improvements and/or utilities periodically inspected by the
village engineer or his representative during the process of construction. The fee for such inspection
services shall be determined based upon the amount of the letters of credit as required for the
proposed public improvements in accordance with the following fee table:

DEDICATION OF LANDS FOR PUBLIC USE
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 640/714
10-5-1: DEDICATION OF SCHOOL SITES OR FOR PAYMENTS OF FUNDS IN LIEU
THEREOF:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or a final plat of a planned unit development, each
subdivider, builder or developer will be required to dedicate land for school sites, to serve the immediate
and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land
dedication, or a combination of both at the option of the village, in accordance with the following criteria
and formula:
A. Criteria For Requiring School Site Dedication:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate number of students to be generated by a
subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be
dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the
ratio of: a) estimated children to be served in each such school classification as herein determined
over the b) maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school
classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the c) said minimum recommended
number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product
thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve
the estimated increased children in each such school classification.
2. School Classification And Size Of School Site: School classifications and size of school sites within
the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria:
School
Classification
By Grades
Maximum
Number
Of Students
For
Each Such
School
Classification
Minimum Number Of
Acres Of Land For
Each School Site Of
Such Classification
Elementary schools, grades kindergarten through
5th (K - 5)
600 students 11 acres 5 + 6 = 11
acres
Junior high schools, grades 6th through 8th (6 - 8) 700 students 29 acres 20 + 9 = 29
acres
High schools, grades 9th through 12th (9 - 12) 2,500 students 55 acres 30 + 25 = 55
acres
The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall
be used as a guideline in locating sites.
B. Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of A School Site: Where the development is small and
the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for a school
site as determined by the village, the village shall require the builder to pay a cash contribution in lieu
of the land dedication required. The cash contribution in lieu of school sites shall, prior to the issuance
of each building permit, be paid by the owner/builder and/or developer directly to the appropriate
school districts for the use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 641/714
area of concern for that subdivision or for the improvement to existing school sites or for the
improvement and/or expansion of existing school facilities or for the purchase of additional
instructional materials used in conjunction with the instruction of students. (Ord. 1408, 9-12-1994, eff.
11-1-1994; amd. Ord. 1567, 1-26-1998)
1. Fair Market Value: The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of
the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been
dedicated as park and recreation and school sites. It has been determined that the present "fair
market value" of such improved land in and surrounding the village is sixty five thousand five
hundred dollars ($65,500.00) per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation
herein unless the subdivider or developer of a planned unit development files a written objection
thereto. In the event of any such objection the subdivider or developer of planned unit development
shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the area of his
subdivision or planned unit development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said
"fair market value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board of trustees
based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer of a planned unit
development and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board of trustees by the
school district or others.

2. Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Fund: There will be situations in subdivisions or planned
unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both
necessary. These occasions will arise when:
a. Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a school site. That
portion of the land within the subdivision or planned unit development falling within the school
location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be
required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated.
b. A major part of the school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is
needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
C. Density Formula: The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written
objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer of the planned unit development:

In the event a subdivider or developer of a planned unit development files a written objection to the
table of estimated student population listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study
showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit
development, and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such
calculations shall be made by the village board of trustees based upon such demographic
information submitted by the subdivider or developer of the new subdivision or planned unit
development and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board of trustees by the
school districts or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local
conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the
payment of funds in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if
necessary.
D. Reservation Of Additional Land: Where any other ordinance of the village requires a larger amount of
property for school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the subdivider or
developer of a planned unit development is required to dedicate by virtue of the provisions of this
section, such other ordinance shall prevail and be complied with.
E. Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less
than forty (40) acres, a school site which is to be dedicated should, when practical, be combined with
dedications from adjoining subdivisions or planned unit developments in order to produce usable
school sites without hardship on a particular subdivider or developer of a planned unit development.
F. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its
surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose.
G. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated and improved in accordance with the applicable
ordinances of the village.
H. Intergovernmental Agreement: As a condition precedent to the receipt of any funds by a school district
as a result of this section, said school district shall execute and deliver to the village an
intergovernmental agreement in a form acceptable to the village.

I. Reservation Of Right: The village specifically reserves the right to rescind this section at any time or to
compromise any claim brought against it as a result of its effect. (Ord. 1408, 9-12-1994, eff. 11-1-
1994; amd. Ord. 1567, 1-26-1998)
10-5-2: LIBRARY CONTRIBUTIONS:
As a condition of approval of final plat of subdivision or a planned unit development, each subdivider or
developer shall be required to dedicate cash for library purposes, at the rate of one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) per residential unit, prior to the time any building permit is issued for the same, to help serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, providing such subdivision or part
thereof lies within the Mokena library district.
A. Time And Manner Of Payment: The developer's or subdivider's contribution shall be made in full, to
the Mokena public library district prior to the issuance of building permits. A receipt will be issued by
the library district to evidence payment by the developer or subdivider. The library district receipt must
be presented by the developer or subdivider to the building department as evidence that the library
district contribution has been paid pursuant to the terms of this section.
B. Indemnity Of Village: As a condition precedent to the receipt of any funds by the Mokena library
district, said library district shall execute and deliver to the village an indemnification agreement which
specifically states:
1. That the district agrees to reimburse the village in the event the village shall be required to refund
any funds collected hereunder pursuant to the terms of this section.
2. That the district agrees to pay all legal fees incurred in the event the legality of this section is
litigated.
C. Reservation Of Right: The village specifically reserves the right to rescind this section at any time or to
compromise any claim brought against it as a result of its effect. (Ord. 1442, 4-24-1995; amd. Ord.
1567, 1-26-1998)
10-5-3: PARK LAND DEDICATIONS:
As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat of a planned unit development,
each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes to serve
the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or a cash contribution in lieu of
actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village, in accordance with the
following criteria and formula as set forth in this section:
A. Criteria For Requiring Park And Recreational Land Dedication:
1. Requirement And Population Ratio: The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear
directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be seven and
five-tenths (7.5) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with
the following classification:
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 645/714
Type Of
Recreation Area Size Range
Minimum Acres
Per 1,000 People
Communitywide recreation park Minimum 12 acres up to 30
acres
2.50 acres
Districtwide park or play field Minimum 4 acres up to 30
acres
1.75 acres
Neighborhood park Minimum park 31/2 acres 1.50 acres
Play lot Minimum 8,000 square feet n/a
School - park (neighborhood
playground)
Minimum park 5 acres 1.75 acres
Total 7.5 acres of land per 1,000
people
2. Location: "The comprehensive park and recreation plan and/or standards by types of recreation
and park areas", as adopted by the Mokena community park district shall be used as a guideline in
locating sites. A park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres shall
be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is
most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the development
according to established standards for park area distances.
3. Credit For Private Open Spaces And Recreation Areas: When subdividers or developers provide
their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for
local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development, a portion of the park
and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the village
board, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The
extent of same shall be determined by the village board based upon the needs of the projected
residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area.
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher
degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the
developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities
to be installed, must be approved by the village, and before any credit is given for private recreation
areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be
permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private
"swimming clubs" are included in this provision. A copy of "Suggested Criteria For Swimming Pool
Development" as adopted by the Mokena community public park district shall be used for the
guidance of the developer. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be
necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the
subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given.
B. Criteria For Requiring A Contribution In Lieu Of Park Sites: Where development is small and the
resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and
recreational purposes, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution
in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land
dedication shall be paid to and held by the Mokena community park district solely for the following
purposes: 1) acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified; 2) improvements to
existing parks which shall be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that
subdivision or development; and/or 3) construction of new facilities for parks and recreation which will
benefit the whole community. (Ord. 1409, 9-12-1994, eff. 11-1-1994; amd. Ord. 1567, 1-26-1998)
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 646/714
1. Fair Market Value: The cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of
the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been
dedicated as park and recreation sites. It has been determined that the present "fair market value"
of such improved land in and surrounding the village is sixty five thousand five hundred dollars
($65,500.00) per acre and such figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the
subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto. In the event of any such objection, the
developer shall submit an appraisal showing the "fair market value" of such improved land in the
area of his development or other evidence thereof and final determination of said "fair market
value" per acre of such improved land shall be made by the village board based upon such
information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be
submitted to the village board by the Mokena community park district. (Ord. 2003-O-007, 1-27-
2003)
2. Criteria For Requiring Dedication And A Contribution: There will be situations in subdivisions or
planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land
are both necessary. These occasions will arise when:
a. Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site. That
portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a
site aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that
would have been required to be dedicated.
b. A major part of the local park or recreation site had already been acquired and only a small
portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall
be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
3. Time Of Conveyance Of Cash Payment In Lieu Of Or In Conjunction With Land Donation: The
developer's or subdivider's cash payment in lieu of or in conjunction with land donation, in
accordance with the formula herein, shall be made in full, to the Mokena community park district
prior to the issuance of building permits. If the village board approves the subdivision or planned
unit development in phases, also known as units, and the plat is recorded in phases, then the
payment will be due for the total phase prior to the first building permit being issued for said phase.
A receipt will be issued by the park district to evidence payment by the developer or subdivider. The
park district receipt must be presented, by the developer or subdivider, to the building department
as evidence that the park district contribution has been paid pursuant to the terms of this section.
C. Density Formula: The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short
range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount
of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu thereof unless a written
objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer:
The estimated population of new residents as herein determined is as follows:
POPULATION GENERATED MULTIPLIERS
Type Of Residential Unit No. Of Bedrooms

Detached single-family 2 2.580
3 3.510
4 3.820
5 4.160
In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table of population generated
multipliers contained herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated
additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that
event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by
the village board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or
developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park district
or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over
the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of funds in lieu
thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary.
D. Reservation Of Additional Land: Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for
a larger amount of park and recreational land in a particular subdivision or planned unit development
than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall
be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village,
provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat.
E. Combining With Adjoining Developments: Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less
than forty (40) acres, public open space which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be
combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas
without hardship on a particular developer.
F. Topography And Grading: The slope, topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its
surroundings must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated for park and
recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land.
G. Improved Sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, water,
sewer, and street (including enclosed drainage and curb and gutter) as applicable to the location of
the site or acceptable provisions made therefor.
H. Intergovernmental Agreement: As a condition precedent to the receipt of any funds by the park district
as a result of this section, said park district shall execute and deliver to the village an
intergovernmental agreement in a form acceptable to the village.

I. Reservation Of Right: The village specifically reserves the right to rescind this section at any time or to
compromise any claim brought against it as a result of its effect. (Ord. 1409, 9-12-1994, eff. 11-1-
1994; amd. Ord. 1567, 1-26-1998)
10-5-4: FIRE DISTRICT CONTRIBUTIONS:
As a condition of approval of any final plat of subdivision or planned unit development, subsequent to the
effective date hereof, each subdivider or developer shall be required to dedicate cash for fire protection
purposes, at the rate of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per residential unit, prior to the time any
building permit is issued for the same, to help serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of
the development. Building permits for residential units in previously approved final plats of subdivision or
planned unit developments shall not be subject to such dedication for fire protection purposes.
A. Time And Manner Of Payment: The developer's or subdivider's contribution shall be made in full, to
the fire protection district in which the property is situated (Mokena, Frankfort or New Lenox, as the
case may be), prior to the issuance of building permits. A receipt will be issued by the appropriate fire
protection district to evidence payment by the developer or subdivider. The receipt must be presented
by the developer or subdivider to the building department as evidence that the fire protection district
contribution has been paid pursuant to the terms of this section.
B. Indemnity Of Village: As a condition precedent to the receipt of any funds by a fire protection district,
said district shall execute and deliver to the village an indemnification agreement which specifically
states:
1. That the district agrees to reimburse the village in the event the village shall be required to refund
any funds collected hereunder pursuant to the terms of this section.
2. That the district agrees to pay all legal fees and expenses incurred in the event the legality of this
section is litigated.
C. Reservation Of Right: The village specifically reserves the right to rescind this section at any time or to
compromise any claim brought against it as a result of its effect. (Ord. 1672, 10-25-1999)

resurfacing of roads when there is no increase in elevation, or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading or construction of levees.
ELEVATION CERTIFICATE: A form published by the federal emergency management agency that is
used to certify the elevation to which a building has been elevated.
EROSION: The general process whereby soils are moved by flowing water or wave action.
EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS: Organizations which are exempt from this chapter per the Illinois Compiled
Statutes including state, federal or local units of government.
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes
are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads is completed before April 1, 1990).
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes
are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

The Building and Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for fulfilling all the duties listed in this section
and the general administration and enforcement of this chapter, which shall include, but not be limited to,
the following:
A. Determining The Floodplain Designation: Check all new development sites to determine whether they
are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a
floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain on which a detailed study has not been conducted which
drains more than one square mile. Check whether the development is potentially within an extended
SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the development would have
adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the
applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining
sections of this chapter.
B. Professional Engineer Review: If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain on which
a detailed study has not been conducted which drains more than one square mile then the permit
shall be referred to a registered professional engineer (PE) under the employ or contract of the Village
for review to ensure that the development meets the requirements of section 11-1-6 of this chapter.
In the case of an appropriate use, the professional engineer shall state in writing that the development
meets the requirements of section 11-1-6 of this chapter.
C. Dam Safety Requirements: Ensure that an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit has been issued or a letter
indicating no dam safety permit is required, if the proposed development activity includes construction
of a "dam" as defined in section 11-1-2 of this chapter. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive
culverts or impoundment structures.
D. Other Permit Requirements: Ensure that any and all required Federal, State and local permits are
received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit.

E. Plan Review And Permit Issuance: Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the
jurisdiction of the Village meet the requirements of this chapter and issue a floodplain development
permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when
the development meets the conditions of this chapter.
F. Inspection Review: Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure
proper elevation of the structure and to ensure they comply with the provisions of this chapter.
G. Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain in the permit files an elevation certificate certifying
the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building or the
elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate,
for all buildings subject to section 11-1-8 of this chapter for public inspection and provide copies of
same.
H. Records For Public Inspection: Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood
data, SFHA and regulatory floodway maps, copies of Federal or State permit documents, variance
documentation, conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and
"as built" elevation and floodproofing or elevation and floodproofing certificates for all buildings
constructed subject to this chapter.
I. State Permits: Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by the IDNR/OWR for all
development projects subject to sections 11-1-6 and 11-1-7 of this chapter, unless enforcement
responsibility has been delegated to the Village. However, the following review approvals are not
delegated to the Village and shall require review or permits from IDNR/OWR:
1. Organizations which are exempt from this chapter, as per Illinois Compiled Statutes;
2. Department of Transportation projects, dams or impoundment structures and all other State,
Federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the Village and County, except for
those projects meeting the requirements of subsection 11-1-6I of this chapter;
3. An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood
damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per subsection 11-1-6E5 of this
chapter;
4. An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection 11-1-6E4 of this chapter;
5. Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in
subsections 11-1-6E1, E2 and E8 of this chapter;

K. Promulgate Regulations: Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the
provisions of this chapter, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for
any chapter changes. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-1-4: BASE FLOOD ELEVATION:
This chapter's protection standard is based on the Countywide flood insurance study of Will County,
Illinois, and incorporated areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and dated
September 6, 1995, and as modified or amended from time to time. If the base flood elevation or 100-
year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be
according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information
Repository. When a party disagrees with the best available data, he/she may finance the detailed
engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and
FEMA. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
A. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of Hickory Creek and East Marley
Creek shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide flood insurance study of
Will County, Illinois, and incorporated areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, and dated February 15, 2019, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.
B. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated
Will County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village or that may be annexed into the
Village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide flood insurance study
of Will County, Illinois, and incorporated areas, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management

Agency, and dated September 6, 1995. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
D. The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as
an "A Zone" on the Countywide flood insurance study of Will County, Illinois, and incorporated areas,
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and dated February 15, 2019, shall be
according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information
Repository. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-
year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such
as HEC-II, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP.
The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as
HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United
States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Flood flows should be based on
anticipated future land use conditions in the watershed as determined from adopted local and regional
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 658/714
land use plans. Along any watercourses draining more than one square mile, the above analysis shall
be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval. Once approved, it must be submitted to the Illinois State
Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood
elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed
engineering study and approved by the Illinois State Water Survey. (Ord. 2019-O-002, 1-28-2019)
E. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with drainage area less than 1 square mile) which has been
identified by the Building and Zoning Administrator pursuant to subsection 11-1-3A of this chapter, the
base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in this
section with concurrence of the IDNR/OWR or Village Engineer. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-1-5: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base
flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage and other provisions of
this chapter are met. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or
systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along
with the requirements of section 11-1-8 of this chapter.
A. Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body not exempted by State law
shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the
Building and Zoning Administrator.
B. Application: Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the Building
and Zoning Administrator. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to
scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a
licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in MSL, 1929 adj. datum or

buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor
(including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the
development will be subject to the requirements of section 11-1-8 of this chapter.
C. Flood Elevation: Upon receipt of a development permit application, the building and zoning
administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood
elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base
flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building official shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
D. Soil Erosion And Sediment Control Plan: A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan, prepared in
accordance with chapter 3 of this title, for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a
description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control
measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final
stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure
postconstruction maintenance.

E. Permits Required: The building and zoning administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant, copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters
that may be required for this type of activity. The building and zoning administrator shall not issue a
permit unless all other local, state and federal permits have been obtained.
F. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public
health and safety.
G. Elevation Of Site: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR)
from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
H. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of
space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a minimum of at least a
hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency
flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least 1.25 times the volume of storage lost due to
the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite
or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year
flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage
lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood
elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)

C. Federal And State Permits Required: The building and zoning administrator shall be responsible for
obtaining from the applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits and approvals that may
be required for this type of activity. The building and zoning administrator shall not issue the
development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A registered
professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the village shall review and approve
applications reviewed under this section.
D. Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway
which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and
which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a
threat to public health and safety and welfare, or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions
of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat.
Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this
chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Illinois administrative code part 708 will be allowed.
Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building
additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise
nonappropriate area uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act
as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. The
approved appropriate uses are as follows:
1. Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to
the control of drainage, flooding or erosion or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
2. Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as
pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities and improvements related to recreational boating,
commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
3. Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls;
4. Underground and overhead utilities;
5. Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems including any related fencing (at least
50 percent open when viewed from any 1 direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and
including open air pavilions;

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 662/714
6. Storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures without toilet facilities to existing
buildings that will not block flood flows, nor reduce floodway storage;
7. Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification
thereto;
8. Parking lots and any modifications thereto (where no fill is allowed and the depth of flooding at the
100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 feet) and aircraft parking aprons built at or below
ground elevation;
9. Regulatory floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a
watercourse;
10. Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of
watertight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential,
commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more
than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not
considered substantial improvements to the structure.
11. In the case of damaged or replacement buildings, reconstruction or repairs made to a building that
are valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the building before it was
damaged or replaced, and which do not increase the outside dimensions of the building.
12. Additions to existing buildings above the BFE that do not increase the building's footprint and are
valued at less than fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the building.
E. Engineering And Mitigation Criteria: Within the regulatory floodway as identified on the regulatory
floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered
permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria
and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a registered professional
engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 11-1-8 of this
chapter:
1. Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For
appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossing, on-stream structures or dams, all effective
regulatory floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to
and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective regulatory floodway
conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
a. Regulatory floodway conveyance,
"K" = 1.486AR2/3
n
where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective area of the cross section, and "R" is
the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See "Open Channel Hydraulics", Ven Te Chow,
1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York.)
b. The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a
recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can assure the
proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a
nonvegetative land cover.
c. Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective regulatory floodway
conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 663/714
engineer can provide to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more
abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
(1) When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed
to expand no faster than a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded
stream's length.
(2) When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed
to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the
flooded steam's length.
(3) When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical
transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used.
(4) Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and
contractions and when meeting the regulatory floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
(5) All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
2. Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream Flooding: Compensatory
storage shall be provided for any regulatory floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from
the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-quarter (1.25)
times the volume of floodplain storage lost. Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in
head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. The compensatory regulatory
floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed
100-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood
elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All regulatory floodway
storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-
year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse. If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed
construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of
flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is at a minimum
hydraulically equivalent. Finally, there shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a
floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing
structure.
3. Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights: For
all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on-stream structures, the proposed work will not
result in an increase in the average channel or regulatory floodway velocities, or stage for all flood
events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. However, in the case of bridges or
culverts or on-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and
sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design measures.
4. Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches: The proposed
structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1')
when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year
frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks
(or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection
grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. If the proposed
construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth foot (0.1') the developer
must contact IDNR/OWR, dam safety section for a dam safety permit or waiver.
a. The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study
flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tail water conditions for the flood study specified in
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 664/714
section 11-1-4 of this chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA hydraulic
chart for the selection of highway culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/federal
highway administration hydraulics of bridge waterways calculation procedures.
b. Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection E2 of this section.
c. Velocity increased must be mitigated per subsection E3 of this section.
d. If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial
navigation, a department of transportation permit must be received.
e. The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and
proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is
not required by subsection D of this section.
5. Reconstruction Or Modification Of Existing Bridges, Culverts And Approach Roads:
a. The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed
with no more than one-tenth foot (0.1') increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all
flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source
of flood damage.
b. If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or
structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of
redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects
on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
c. The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and
should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with the department of transportation
rules 92 Illinois administrative code 708 (floodway construction in northeastern Illinois) and
submitted to the IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued.
6. On-Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water: Any increase in upstream flood
stages greater than 0.0 foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within
existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of
existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements. A permit or letter indicating a
permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR dam safety section for a dam safety
permit or waiver for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during
normal or flood flow. All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 11-1-2 of this
chapter shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (construction
and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or
floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
a. The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public
recreation, or regional storm water detention.
b. The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access
to upstream areas as a part of their life cycle, such as spawning;
c. The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions.
Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization
measures, and a presedimentation basin.
d. A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the
effects of the sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals,
and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 665/714
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream
municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control;
e. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
7. Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures: If construction is
required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the
floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten feet (10') from the outside of the
building. Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing
activities.
8. Excavation In The Floodway: When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert
openings, including the modifications to the replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or
to compensate for lost conveyance for other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided
for the excavation. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an
applicant's engineer can provide to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that
more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
a. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to
expand no faster than a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded
stream's length;
b. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to
contract no faster than at a rate of one foot (1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded
stream's length; and
c. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical
transition for every ten feet (10') of stream length shall be used;
d. Erosion/scour protection shall be provided inland upstream and downstream of the transition
sections.
9. Channel Modification: If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be
demonstrated that:
a. There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less
impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include
levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a streamside buffer
strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural
conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
b. Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the
modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the
replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;
c. The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize
its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the
following criteria:
(1) The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those
of the existing channel in length, cross section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has
been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
(2) Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream
ends of the project, designed such as they will prevent erosion.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 666/714
(3) One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside
(riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of the channel, where possible, to preserve
the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.
(4) Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of
the channel.
(5) Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three to one (3:1)
horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the
preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the
use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap
are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble
should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
(6) All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as
soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material
shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative
cover.
(7) If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles and
other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and
nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
(8) A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce
sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality.
(9) New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including
vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel.
(10) There shall be no increase in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project
site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such
an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
(11) Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the
volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification; and
d. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
10. Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading,
filling and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and
sedimentation control measures shall be employed in accordance with chapter 3 of this title.
11. Public Flood Control Projects: For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this
section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic
and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in
increased flood heights outside the project right of way or easements for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency event.
12. General Criteria For Analysis Of Flood Elevations:
a. The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the regulatory floodway study, referenced in
section 11-1-4 of this chapter, must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data
appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval
and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 667/714
b. If the 100-year regulatory floodplain elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected
by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed
construction shall be shown to meet the requirements of this subsection for the 100-year
frequency flood elevations of the regulatory floodway conditions and conditions with the receiving
stream at normal water elevations.
c. If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream
restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional
flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next
five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown for both the existing
conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control
project is built.
13. Conditional Letter Of Map Revision: If the appropriate use would result in a change in the
regulatory floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to
IDNR/OWR and to FEMA all the information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a
conditional regulatory floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional approval of
the regulatory floodway change before a permit is issued. However, the final regulatory floodway
map will not be changed by IDNR/OWR until as built plans or record drawings are submitted and
accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in
incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed
conditional regulatory floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. No filling,
grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. No further
development activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA
and IDNR/OWR.
14. Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the
supervision of a registered professional engineer.
15. Construction Within Floodways: For all activities in the floodway involving construction within
twenty five feet (25') of the channel, a natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at
least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel where it is impossible to
protect this buffer strip during construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be
established upon completion of construction.
16. Change Of Regulatory Floodway Map: After receipt of conditional approval of the regulatory
floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional letter of map revision, construction as
necessary to change the regulatory floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or
structures or other construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the
regulatory floodway map is changed and a final letter of map revision is received. The regulatory
floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the
"as built" plans.
F. State Review: For those projects listed below located in a regulatory floodway, the following criteria
shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence prior to the issuance of a permit:
1. IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to a proposed bridge pursuant
to subsection E4 of this section.
2. IDNR/OWR will review an engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not
a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, pursuant to
subsection E5 of this section.
3. IDNR/OWR will review alternate transition sections and hydraulically equivalent storage pursuant to
subsections E1, E2 and E8 of this section.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 668/714
4. IDNR/OWR will review and approve prior to the start of construction any department projects, dams
(as defined in section 11-1-2 of this chapter) and all other state, federal or local units of government
projects, including projects of the municipality or county.
G. Other Permits: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, a development permit for a site
located in a floodway shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a permit or written
documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR, issued pursuant to 615 Illinois Compiled
Statutes 5/5 et seq. No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the division has delegated this
responsibility to the village.
H. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a "dam" as
defined in section 11-1-2 of this code per 92 Illinois administrative code 702 (rules for construction of
dams) shall obtain an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit prior to the start of construction of a dam. If the
building and zoning administrator finds a dam that does not have a IDNR/OWR permit, he shall
immediately notify the dam safety section of the IDNR/OWR. If the building and zoning administrator
finds a dam which is believed to be in unsafe condition, the building and zoning administrator shall
immediately notify the owner of the dam, IDNR/OWR, dam safety section in Springfield and the Illinois
emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA).
I. Activities That Do Not Require A Registered Professional Engineer's Review: The following activities
may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's review. Such activities shall still meet
the other requirements of this chapter, including the mitigation requirements.
1. Underground and overhead utilities that:
a. Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or
b. Do not require the placement of aboveground structures in the floodway, or
c. In the case of underground stream crossing, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a
minimum of three feet (3') below the existing streambed,
d. In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are
designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris, and
e. A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water pollution as defined by the
environmental protection act, Illinois Compiled Statutes chapter 415, act 5 (1992 state bar
edition) shall be provided with shut off valves on each side of the body of water to be crossed.
2. Storm and sanitary sewer outfalls that:
a. Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope, and
b. Do not result in an increase in ground elevations, and
c. Are designed so as not to cause stream erosion at the outfall location.
3. Construction of sidewalks, athletic fields (excluding fences), properly anchored playground
equipment and patios at grade.
4. Construction of shoreline and stream bank protection that:
a. Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 669/714
b. Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
c. Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area of the stream channel or bank
of the lake.
d. Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for existing
erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action necessitate the
use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap
are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction rubble and gabions
should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
5. Temporary stream crossings in which:
a. The approach roads will be one-half foot (1/2') or less above natural grade.
b. The crossing will allow stream flow to pass without backing up the water above the stream bank
vegetation line or above the drainage tile or outfall invert.
c. The top of the roadway fill in the channel will be at least two feet (2') below the top of the lowest
bank. Any fill in the channel shall be nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
d. All distributed stream banks will be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon
installation and again upon removal of construction.
e. The access road and temporary crossings will be removed within one year after authorization.
(Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-1-7: OCCUPATION AND USE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS WHERE
FLOODWAYS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED:
In SFHA or floodplains (including AE, AH, AO, and unnumbered A zones), where no floodways have
been identified and no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations have been established by
FEMA, and draining more than one square mile, no development shall be permitted unless the
cumulative effect of the proposals, when combined with all other existing and anticipated uses and
structures, shall not significantly impede or increase the flow and passage of the floodwaters nor
increase the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevations by more than one-tenth foot (0.1').
A. Development Permit: No person, firm, corporation or governmental body, not exempted by state law,
shall commence any development in an SFHA or floodplain without first obtaining a development
permit from the building and zoning administrator. Application for a development permit shall be made
on a form provided by the building and zoning administrator. The application shall be accompanied by
drawings of the site, drawn to scale showing property line dimensions; and existing grade elevations
and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling, sealed by a licensed engineer, architect
or surveyor; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings; and the elevation
at the lowest floor (including basement) of all proposed buildings subject to the requirements of
section 11-1-8 of this chapter.
The application for a development permit shall also include the following information:
1. A detailed description of the proposed activity, its purpose and intended use;
2. Site location (including legal description) of the property, drawn to scale, on the regulatory floodway
maps, indicating whether it is proposed to be in an incorporated or unincorporated area;
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 670/714
3. Anticipated dates and initiation and completion of activity;
4. Plans of the proposed activity shall be provided which include as a minimum:
a. A vicinity map showing the site of the activity, name of the waterway, boundary lines, names of
roads and the vicinity of the site, graphic or numerical scale, and north arrow;
b. A plan view of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed conditions
including principal dimensions of the structure or work, elevations in mean sea level (1929
adjustment) datum or NGVD, adjacent property lines and ownership, drainage and flood control
easements, distance between proposed activity and navigation channel (when the proposed
construction is near a commercially navigable body of water), floodplain limit, location and
orientation of cross sections, north arrow, and a graphical or numerical scale;
c. Cross section views of the project and engineering study reach showing existing and proposed
conditions including principal dimensions of the work as shown in plan view, existing and
proposed elevations, normal water elevation, 10-year frequency flood elevation, 100-year
frequency flood elevation, and graphical or numerical scales (horizontal and vertical); and
d. A soil erosion and sedimentation control plan for disturbed areas. This plan shall include a
description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control
measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of
final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to
ensure postconstruction maintenance.
5. Engineering calculations and supporting data shall be submitted showing that the proposed work
will meet the criteria of subsection D of this section.
6. Any and all other local, state and federal permits or approvals that may be required for this type of
development.
B. Elevation: Based on the best available existing data according to the Illinois state water survey's
floodplain information repository, the building and zoning administrator shall compare the elevation of
the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Should no elevation information exist
for the site, the developer's engineer shall calculate the elevation according to subsection 11-1-4D of
this chapter. Any development located on land that can be shown to have been higher than the base
flood elevation as of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building official shall maintain
documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this
ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
C. Administration: The building and zoning administrator shall be responsible for obtaining from the
applicant copies of all other local, state and federal permits, approvals or permit not required letters
that may be required for this type of activity. The building and zoning administrator shall not issue the
development permit unless all required local, state and federal permits have been obtained.
D. Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the SFHA, where a floodway has not been
determined shall create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or

E. Standards: Within all riverine SFHAs where the floodway has not been determined, the following
standards shall apply:
1. Written Statement: The developer shall have a registered professional engineer state in writing and
show through supporting plans, calculations and data that the project meets the engineering
requirements of subsections 11-1-6E1 through E9 of this chapter for the entire floodplain as
calculated under the provisions of subsection 11-1-4D of this chapter. As an alternative, the
developer should have an engineering study performed to determine a floodway and submit that
engineering study to IDNR/OWR for acceptance as a regulatory floodway. Upon acceptance of their
floodway by the department, the developer shall then demonstrate that the project meets the
requirements of section 11-1-6 of this chapter for the regulatory floodway. The floodway shall be
defined according to the definition in section 11-1-2 of this chapter.
2. Development Permit: A development permit shall not be issued unless the applicant first obtains a
permit from IDNR/OWR or written documentation that a permit is not required from IDNR/OWR.
3. Permit Responsibility: No permit from IDNR/OWR shall be required if the division has delegated
permit responsibility to the village per 92 Illinois administrative code, part 708 for regulatory
floodways, per IDNR/OWR statewide permit entitled "Construction In Flood Plains With No
Designated Floodways In Northeastern Illinois".
4. Dam Safety Permits: Any work involving the construction, modification or removal of a dam or an
on-stream structure to impound water as defined in section 11-1-2 of this chapter shall obtain
IDNR/OWR dam safety permit or letter indicating a permit is not required prior to the start of
construction of a dam. If the building and zoning administrator finds a dam that does not have a
IDNR/OWR permit, the building and zoning administrator shall immediately notify the dam safety
section of the IDNR/OWR. If the building and zoning administrator finds a dam which is believed to
be in unsafe condition, the building and zoning administrator shall immediately notify the owner of
the dam and the Illinois emergency services and disaster agency (ESDA), and the IDNR/OWR,
dam safety section in Springfield.
5. Activities: The following activities may be permitted without a registered professional engineer's
review or calculation of a base flood elevation and regulatory floodway. Such activities shall still
meet the other requirements of this chapter:
a. Underground and overhead utilities that:
(1) Do not result in any increase in existing ground elevations, or
(2) Do not require the placement of aboveground structure in the floodway, or
(3) In the case of underground stream crossings, the top of the pipe or encasement is buried a
minimum of three feet (3') below the existing streambed, and
(4) In the case of overhead utilities, no supporting towers are placed in the watercourse and are
designed in such a fashion as not to catch debris.
(5) A utility crossing carrying material which may cause water pollution as defined by the
environmental protection act Illinois Compiled Statutes chapter 415 act 5 (1992 state bar
edition) shall be provided with shutoff valves on each side of the body of water to be crossed.
b. Storm and sanitary outfalls that:
(1) Do not extend riverward or lakeward of the existing adjacent natural bank slope, and
(2) Do not result in an increase in ground elevation, and
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

c. Construction of shoreline and streambed protection that:
(1) Does not exceed one thousand feet (1,000') in length or two (2) cubic yards per lineal foot of
streambed.
(2) Materials are not placed higher than the existing top of bank.
(3) Materials are placed so as not to reduce the cross sectional area of the stream channel by
more than ten percent (10%).
(4) Vegetative stabilization and gradual side slopes are the preferred mitigation methods for
existing erosion problems. Where high channel velocities, sharp bends or wave action
necessitates the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques,
natural rock or riprap are preferred materials. Artificial materials such as concrete, construction
rubble and gabions should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
d. Temporary stream crossings in which:
(1) The approach roads will be one-half foot (1/2') or less above natural grade.

i. The construction of additions to existing buildings which do not increase the first floor area by
more than twenty percent (20%), which are located on the upstream or downstream side of the
existing building, and which do not extend beyond the sides of the existing building that are
parallel to the flow of floodwaters.
j. Minor maintenance dredging of a stream channel where:
(1) The affected length of stream is less than one thousand feet (1,000'),
(2) The work is confined to reestablishing flows in natural stream channels, or
(3) The cross sectional areas of the dredged channel conform to that of the natural channel
upstream and downstream of the site.

Chapter 2
STORM WATER DRAINAGE AND DETENTION
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 680/714
11-2-1: TITLE:
The regulations contained in this chapter shall be referred to officially as the STORM WATER
DRAINAGE AND DETENTION REGULATIONS OF THE VILLAGE OF MOKENA. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-2-2: PURPOSE:
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the powers granted to the village by 65 Illinois Complied Statutes
5/1-2-1 et seq., 11-12-12m, 11-30-8, and 11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to diminish threats to
public health, safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive storm water from new development and
redevelopment. This excessive storm water could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the
erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and lake
resources. The cause of increases in storm water runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the
development and improvement of land and as such this chapter regulates these activities to prevent
adverse impacts. This chapter is adopted to accomplish the following objectives:
A. Assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others, or create
unstable conditions susceptible to erosion;
B. Protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased storm
water runoff;
C. Protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis;
D. Lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood damaged public facilities
and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by
increased storm water runoff quantities from new development;
E. Protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources;
F. Preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect
water quality and aquatic habitats;
G. Preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and storm water
impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide
recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic
development. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-2-3: AUTHORITY:
Authority for the administration of these regulations shall be vested in the planning commission and the
village board as hereinafter set forth. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-2-4: DEFINITIONS:

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 686/714
11-2-7: MINIMIZATION OF INCREASES IN RUNOFF VOLUMES AND RATES:
In the selection of a drainage plan for a development, the applicant shall evaluate and implement, where
practicable, site design features which minimize the increase in runoff volumes and rates from the site.
The applicant's drainage plan submittal shall include evaluations of site design features which are

on the property itself. Detention basins shall incorporate design features to capture storm water runoff
pollutants. Retention and infiltration of storm water shall be promoted throughout the property's
drainage system to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and to reduce the quantity of runoff
pollutants.
B. The drainage system should incorporate multiple uses where practicable. Uses considered compatible
with storm water management include open space, aesthetics, aquatic habitat, recreation (boating,
trails, playing fields), wetlands and water quality mitigation. The applicant should avoid using portions
of the property exclusively for storm water management. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-2-9: DESIGN CRITERIA, STANDARDS, AND METHODS:
A. Release Rates: The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of
discharge from the property for the 2-year, 24-hour and 100-year, 24-hour events to levels which will
not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate
with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from
events less than or equal to the 2-year event shall not be greater than 0.04 cfs per acre of property
drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.15 cfs per acre of property drained.
B. Detention Basin Outlet Design: Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage
system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 687/714
C. Detention Storage Requirements: The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin
shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year event of critical duration (requiring maximum storage).
Detention storage shall be computed using methods as described in this section.
D. Drainage System Design And Evaluation: The following criteria should be used in evaluating and
designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the 10-year
peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overland flow path for flows in excess of the design
capacity.
1. Design Methodologies: Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to forty (40) acres may
be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor
drainage system for larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in subsection E of this
section must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than forty (40)
acres of tributary area and for the design of all detention basins designed to work in series. Runoff
hydrograph methods may also be required if deemed necessary by the village engineer.
2. Positive Drainage: All areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass
the 100-year flow at a stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of
the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system
capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed
street crown by more than three inches (3").
E. Methods For Generating Runoff Hydrographs: Runoff hydrographs shall be developed incorporating
the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture:
1. Rainfall: Unless a continuous simulation approach to drainage system hydrology is used, all design
rainfall events shall be based on the Illinois state water survey's bulletin 70. The first quartile point
rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical
durations less than or equal to twelve (12) hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be
used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations
greater than twelve (12) and less than or equal to twenty four (24) hours. The fourth quartile
distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than twenty
four (24) hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in
table 37 of bulletin 70. The SCS type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff
distributions.
2. Antecedent Moisture: Computations of runoff hydrographs which do not rely on a continuous
accounting of antecedent moisture conditions shall assume a wet antecedent moisture condition of
two (2) as a minimum.
F. Wet Detention Basin Design: Wet detention basins shall be designed to remove storm water pollutants,
to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use.
1. Wet Basin Depths: Wet basins shall be at least three feet (3') deep, excluding near shore banks
and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet (10') deep over
twenty five percent (25%) of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze out.
2. Wet Basin Shoreline Slopes: The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not
be steeper than five to one (5:1) (horizontal to vertical).
3. Permanent Pool Volume: The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal
to the runoff volume from its watershed for the 2-year event.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 688/714
4. Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and
outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin.
G. Dry Detention Basin Design: In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, dry basins shall be
designed to remove storm water pollutants, to be safe, to be aesthetically pleasing and as much as
feasible to be available for multiple uses.
1. Dry Basin Drainage: Dry basins shall be designed so that eighty percent (80%) of their bottom area
shall have standing water no longer than seventy two (72) hours for any runoff event less than the
100-year event. Under drains directed to the outlet control shall be used if necessary to accomplish
this requirement. Grades shall not be less than one percent (1%) on basin floor.
2. Velocity Dissipation: Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to
minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants.
3. Inlet And Outlet Orientation: To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and
outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin.
H. Minimum Detention Outlet Size: Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control
discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches (4"). If this minimum orifice size permits
release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical
alternative, alternative outlet designs which incorporate self-cleaning flow restrictors shall be utilized.
I. Detention In Floodplains: The placement of detention basins within the floodplain is strongly
discouraged because of questions about their reliable operation during flood events. However, the
storm water detention requirements of this chapter may be fulfilled by providing detention storage
within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met:
1. Detention In Flood Fringe Areas: The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall
require compensatory storage for 1.25 times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied
by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall
still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate
its operation for all stream flow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory
storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. All
floodplain storage lost below the 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the 10-year flood
elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced
above the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All compensatory storage excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
2. Detention In Floodways: Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with
subsection I3 of this section.
3. On-Stream Detention: On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide
regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this chapter with respect to water
quality and control of the 2-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. If on-stream
detention is used for watersheds larger than one square mile, it is recommended that the applicant
use dynamic modeling to demonstrate that the design will not increase stage for any properties
upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream
detention shall:
a. Not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as
part of their life cycle, such as for spawning,
b. Not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat,
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 689/714
c. Include a design calling for gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a
presedimentation basin,
d. Involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands,
e. Not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge,
f. Require the implementation of an effective nonpoint source management program throughout the
upstream watershed,
g. Comply with chapter 1 of this title.
h. Comply with chapter 3 of this title.
J. Drainage Into Wetlands: Wetlands shall be protected from damaging modifications and adverse
changes in runoff quality and quantity associated with land developments. In addition to the other
requirements herein, the following requirements shall be met for all developments whose drainage
flows into wetlands:
1. Detention In Wetlands: Existing wetlands shall not be modified for the purposes of storm water
detention unless it is demonstrated that the existing wetland is low in quality and the proposed
modifications will maintain or improve its habitat and ability to perform beneficial functions. Existing
depressional storage in wetlands shall be maintained and the volume of detention storage provided
to meet the requirements of this section shall be in addition to this existing storage.
2. Sediment Control: The existing wetland shall be protected during construction by appropriate soil
erosion and sediment control measures and shall not be filled.
3. Alteration Of Drainage Patterns: Site drainage patterns shall not be altered to substantially
decrease or increase the existing area tributary to the wetland.
4. Detention/Sedimentation: All runoff from the development shall be routed through a preliminary
detention/sedimentation basin designed to capture the 2-year, 24-hour event and release over a
twenty four (24) hour period to the wetland. This basin shall be constructed before property grading
begins. In addition, the drainage hierarchy defined in section 11-2-7 of this chapter should be
followed to minimize runoff volumes and rates being discharged to the wetland.
5. Vegetated Buffer Strip: A buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width, preferably vegetated
with native plant species, shall be maintained or restored around the periphery of the wetland.
K. Street, Parking Lot, And Culvert Drainage:
1. Streets: If streets are to be used as part of the minor or major drainage system, ponding depths
shall not exceed street crown by more than three inches (3"). Streets shall not remain flooded for
more than four (4) hours for any event less than or equal to the 100-year event.
2. Parking Lots: The maximum storm water ponding depth in any parking area shall not exceed six
inches (6") for more than four (4) hours, or as directed by the village engineer.
3. Culvert Road And Driveway Crossings: Sizing of culvert crossings shall consider entrance and exit
losses, as well as tailwater conditions on the culvert.
L. Infiltration Practices: To effectively reduce runoff volumes, infiltration practices including basins,
trenches, and porous pavement should be located on soils in hydrologic soil groups "A" or "B" as
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 690/714
designated by the U.S. soil conservation service. Infiltration basins and trenches designed to
recharge ground water shall not be located within seventy five feet (75') of a water supply well or a
building foundation. A sediment settling basin shall be provided to remove coarse sediment from
storm water flows before they reach infiltration basins or trenches. Storm water shall not be allowed to
stand more than seventy two (72) hours over eighty percent (80%) of a dry basin's bottom area for the
maximum design event to be exfiltrated. The bottom of infiltration facilities shall be a minimum of four
feet (4') above seasonally high ground water and bedrock.
M. Safety Considerations: The drainage system components, especially detention basins, shall be
designed to protect the safety of any children or adults coming in contact with the system during
runoff events.
1. Side Slopes: The side slopes of all detention basins at 100-year capacity shall be as level as
practicable to prevent accidental falls into the basin and for stability and ease of maintenance. Side
slopes of detention basins and open channels shall not be steeper than four to one (4:1) (horizontal
to vertical) above water and three to one (3:1) underwater. At least one foot (1') of freeboard above
the pond overflow elevation shall be provided around the pond.
2. Safety Ledge: All wet detention basins shall have a level safety ledge at least four feet (4') in width
and two and one-half (2.5) to three feet (3') below the normal water depth.
3. Velocity: Velocities throughout the surface drainage system shall be controlled to safe levels taking
into consideration rates and depths of flow.
4. Overflow Structures: All storm water detention basins shall be provided with an overflow structure
capable of safely passing excess flows at a stage at least one foot (1') below the lowest foundation
grade in the vicinity of the detention basin. The design flow rate of the overflow structure shall be
capable of passing at least the equivalent to the 100-year inflow rate.
N. Maintenance Considerations: The storm water drainage system shall be designed to minimize and
facilitate maintenance. Turfed side slopes shall be designed to allow lawn mowing equipment to easily
negotiate them. Wet basins shall be provided with alternate outflows which can be used to completely
drain the pool for sediment removal. (Pumping may be considered if drainage by gravity is not
feasible.) At the village engineer's discretion, presedimentation basins shall be included, where
feasible, for localizing sediment deposition and removal. Access for heavy equipment shall be
provided. On basin side slopes steeper than ten to one (10:1) (horizontal to vertical), excelsior
blankets or sod shall be utilized. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-2-10: ACCOMMODATING FLOWS FROM UPSTREAM TRIBUTARY AREAS:
Storm water runoff from areas tributary to the property shall be considered in the design of the property's
drainage system. Whenever practicable, flows from upstream areas that are not to be detained should be
routed around the basin being provided for the site being developed.
A. Upstream Areas Not Meeting Chapter Requirements: When there are areas not meeting the storage
and release rates of this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, regionalized detention on the
applicant's property shall be explored by the applicant. The following steps shall be followed:
1. The applicant shall compute the storage volume needed for his property using the applicant's
property area, and the release rates and procedures described in section 11-2-9 of this chapter.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 691/714
2. Areas tributary to the applicant's property, not meeting the storage and release rate requirements of
this chapter, shall be identified.
3. Using the areas determined in subsection A2 of this section, plus the applicant's property area,
total storage needed for the combined properties shall be computed.
Allowable release rates shall be computed using the combined property areas. Storage shall be
computed as described in section 11-2-9 of this chapter. If tributary areas are not developed, a
reasonable fully developed land cover, based on local zoning, shall be assumed for the purposes of
computing storage.
Once the necessary combined storage is computed the village may choose to require oversizing of
the applicant's detention basin to accommodate the regional flows. The applicant's responsibility
will be limited to the storage for his property as computed in subsection A1 of this section. If
regional storage is selected by the village, then the design produced in subsection A3 of this
section shall be implemented and the village may enter into a recapture agreement with the
applicant to permit recovery of the oversizing expense. If regional storage is rejected by the village,
the applicant shall bypass all tributary area flows around the applicant's basin whenever
practicable. If the applicant must route upstream flows through his basin and the upstream areas
exceed one square mile in size, the applicant must meet the provisions of subsection 11-2-9I3 of
this chapter for on-stream basins.
B. Upstream Areas Meeting Chapter Requirements: When there are areas which meet the storage and
release rate requirements of this chapter, tributary to the applicant's property, the upstream flows shall
be bypassed around the applicant's detention basin, or be routed through the applicant's detention
basin if this is the only practicable alternative. Storage needed for the applicant's property shall still be
computed as described in subsection A1 of this section. However, if the village decides to route
tributary area flows through an applicant's basin, the final design storm water releases shall be based
on the combined total of the applicant's property plus tributary areas. It must be shown that at no time
will the runoff rate from the applicant's property exceed the allowable release rate for his/her property
alone. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)

Chapter 3
SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL
11-3-1: TITLE:
The regulations contained in this chapter shall be referred to officially as the SOIL EROSION AND
SEDIMENT CONTROL REGULATIONS OF THE VILLAGE OF MOKENA. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 693/714
11-3-2: PURPOSE:
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the powers granted to the village by 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes
5/1-2-1 et seq., 11-12-12m, 11-30-8, and 11-31-2. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons,
protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding,
regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other
activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land
situated in the village. It is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by
land disturbing activities be limited, as closely as practicable, to that which would have occurred if the
land had been left in its natural undisturbed state. The village board hereby finds that:
A. Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural
uses including, but not limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and
industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, the modification of stream channels and
drainageways, and the creation of recreational facilities;
B. The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and
safety of users thereof, by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles;
C. Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed out fills, and embankments;
D. Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams,
lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs;
E. Sediment promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable
aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and
F. Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and
natural depressions, resulting in increased chances of flooding and risk to public health and safety.
(Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-3-3: AUTHORITY:
Authority for the administration of these regulations shall be vested in the planning commission and the
village board of trustees as hereinafter set forth. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 696/714
11-3-6: GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
It is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development
activities, including clearing, grading, stripping, excavating, and filling of land, in the village. Measures
taken to control soil erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is
not transported from site by a storm event of 10-year frequency or less.
The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation
of the submissions required under section 11-3-7 of this chapter:
A. Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least
potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be
avoided wherever possible.
B. Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to
natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible.
Temporary crossings of watercourses, when permitted, must include appropriate stabilization
measures.
C. Special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development
activity within or adjacent to any stream, lake, pond, or wetland. Preventative measures should reflect
the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation.
D. The smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during
development.
E. Sediment basins or traps, filter barriers, diversions, and any other appropriate sediment or runoff
control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove
sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development.
F. The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the
probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of
the risks, costs, and benefits involved.
G. In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing
maintenance should be considered.
H. Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface
conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final
gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site
or downstream.
I. Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during
development.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 697/714
J. Those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with
an appropriate protective cover prior to development.
K. All waste generated as a result of site development activity should be properly disposed of and should
be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water.
L. All construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or
private roadways. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-3-7: LAND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO THIS CHAPTER:

standards and requirements are hereby incorporated into this chapter by reference.
5. The village may waive specific requirements for the content of submissions upon finding that the
information submitted is sufficient to show that the work will comply with the objectives and
principles of this chapter.
E. Review And Approval: Each erosion control plan shall be reviewed and acted upon according to the
following procedures:
The village engineer will review each erosion control plan to determine its conformance with the
provisions of this chapter. The village engineer may also refer any application to the Will-South Cook
soil and water conservation district and/or any other local government or public agency within whose
jurisdiction the site is located for review and comment. The village engineer shall:
1. Approve the erosion control plan if it is found to be in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter;
2. Approve the erosion control plan subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to
secure substantially the objectives of this chapter; or
3. Disapprove the erosion control plan, indicating the deficiencies and the procedure for submitting a
revised plan. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-3-8: DESIGN AND OPERATION STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS:

2. Compliance with the provisions of the erosion control plan or with conditions attached to it by the
village officials,
3. Failure of village officials to observe or recognize hazardous or unsightly conditions,
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 700/714
4. Failure of village officials to recommend denial of or to deny approval of the erosion control plan, or
5. Exemptions from the erosion control plan requirements of this chapter.
C. Site Design Requirements:
1. On site sediment control measures, as specified by the following criteria, shall be constructed and
functional prior to initiating clearing, grading, stripping, excavating or fill activities on the site:
a. For disturbed areas draining less than one acre, filter barriers (including filter fences, straw bales,
or equivalent control measures) shall be constructed to control all off site runoff as specified in
referenced handbooks. Vegetated filter strips, with a minimum width of twenty five feet (25'), may
be used as an alternative only where runoff in sheet flow is expected.
b. Sediment traps or basins are required to control sediment runoff in situations where concentrated
or channelized flow is likely to be present. Generally speaking, sediment barriers such as silt
fences are ineffective and unreliable in such situations. In particular, they are subject to
undercutting and blowout due to high water velocities.
c. For disturbed areas draining more than one acre but less than five (5) acres, a sediment trap or
equivalent control measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area.
d. For disturbed areas draining more than five (5) acres, a sediment basin or equivalent control
measure shall be constructed at the downslope point of the disturbed area.
e. The sediment storage shall be sized to store the estimated sediment load generated from the
site over the duration of the construction period with a minimum storage equivalent to the volume
of sediment generated in one year. For construction periods exceeding one year, the one year
sediment load and a sediment removal schedule may be substituted. The required sediment
storage volume may be calculated using universal soil loss equations or from figure 6-20 in the
Green Book.
f. The village engineer shall determine if additional soil erosion and sediment control measures are
necessary and may require same as needed.
2. Storm water conveyance channels, including ditches, swales, and diversions, and the outlets of all
channels and pipes shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected flow velocity from
the 10-year frequency storm without erosion. All constructed or modified channels shall be
stabilized within forty eight (48) hours, consistent with the following standards:
a. For grades up to four percent (4%), seeding in combination with mulch, erosion blanket, or an
equivalent control measure shall be applied. Sod or erosion blanket or mat shall be applied to the
bottom of the channel.
b. For grades of four (4) to eight percent (8%), sod or an equivalent control measure shall be
applied in the channel.
c. For grades greater than eight percent (8%), rock, riprap, or an equivalent control measure shall
be applied, or the grade shall be effectively reduced using drop structures.
3. Disturbed areas shall be stabilized with temporary or permanent measures within seven (7)
calendar days following the end of active disturbance, consistent with the following criteria:
a. Appropriate temporary or permanent stabilization measures shall include seeding, mulching,
sodding, and/or nonvegetative measures.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 701/714
b. Areas having steep slopes, generally greater than twelve percent (12%) or as determined by the
village engineer shall be stabilized with sod, mat or blanket in combination with seeding, or
equivalent.
4. Land disturbance activities in stream channels shall be avoided, where possible. If disturbance
activities are unavoidable, the following requirements shall be met:
a. Construction vehicles shall be kept out of the stream channel to the maximum extent practicable.
Where construction crossings are necessary, temporary crossings shall be constructed of
nonerosive material, such as riprap or gravel.
b. The time and area of disturbance of stream channels shall be kept to a minimum. The stream
channel, including bed and banks, shall be restabilized within forty eight (48) hours after channel
disturbance is completed, interrupted, or stopped.
c. Whenever channel relocation is necessary, the new channel shall be constructed, dry and fully
stabilized before flow is diverted.
5. Storm sewer inlets and culverts shall be protected by sediment traps or filter barriers, meeting
accepted design standards and specifications, without flooding public streets.
6. Soil storage piles containing more than ten (10) cubic yards of material shall not be located with a
downslope drainage length of less than twenty five feet (25') to a roadway or drainage channel.
Filter barriers, including straw bales, filter fence, or equivalent, shall be installed immediately on the
downslope side of the piles.
7. If dewatering devices are used, discharge locations shall be protected from erosion. All pumped
discharges shall be routed through appropriately designed sediment traps or basins, or equivalent.
8. Each site shall be graveled (or equivalent) entrance roads, access drives, and parking areas of
sufficient length and width to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways.
Any sediment reaching a public or private road shall be removed by shoveling or street cleaning
(not flushing) before the end of each workday and transported to a controlled sediment disposal
area.
9. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control practices must be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure effective performance and their intended function.
10. All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within thirty (30) days
after final site stabilization is achieved with permanent soil stabilization measures. Trapped
sediment and other disturbed soils resulting from the disposition of temporary measures should be
permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation.
D. Handbooks Adopted By Reference: The standards and specifications contained in "Standards And
Specifications For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control" (the Yellow Book) and the "Illinois Procedures
And Standards For Urban Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control" (the Green Book), are hereby
incorporated into this chapter and made a part hereof by reference for the purpose of delineating
procedures and methods of operation. In the event of conflict between provisions of said manuals and
of this chapter, this chapter shall govern.
E. Maintenance Of Control Measures: All soil erosion and sediment control measures necessary to meet
the requirements of this chapter shall be maintained periodically by the owner of the property or his
authorized agent during the period of land disturbance and development of the site in a satisfactory
manner to ensure adequate performance.
12/18/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=1090 702/714
F. Inspection: The village engineer shall make periodic inspections and shall notify the permittee wherein
the work fails to comply with the site development or erosion and sediment control plan as approved.
G. Special Precautions:
1. If at any stage of the grading of any development site the village determines by inspection that the
nature of the site is such that further work authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any
property, public way, stream, lake, wetland, or drainage structure, the village may require, as a
condition of allowing the work to be done, that such reasonable special precautions to be taken as
is considered advisable to avoid the likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but
shall not be limited to, a more level exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities,
berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, and
recommendations of a registered soils engineer and/or engineering geologist which may be made
requirements for further work.
2. Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading on any development site is
not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary structures or
take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On
large developments or where unusual site conditions prevail, the village may specify the time of
starting grading and the time of completion or may require that the operations be conducted in
specific stages so as to ensure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of
seasonal rains.
H. Amendment Of Plans: Major amendments of the site development or erosion and sedimentation
control plans shall be submitted to the village and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in
the same manner as the original plans. Field modifications of a minor nature may be authorized by
the village engineer. (Ord. 1630, 4-12-1999)
11-3-9: EXCEPTIONS:
The village may, in accordance with the following procedures, authorize exceptions to any of the
requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter. Requests for any exception shall be made by
written request, stating fully the grounds of the request and the facts relied upon. Such request shall be
filed with the erosion control plan. In order for the exception request to be granted, it shall be necessary
that the village board find all of the following facts with respect to the land referred:
A. That the land is in such shape or size or is affected by such physical conditions or is subject to such
title limitations of record, that it is impossible or impractical for the owner of the property or his
authorized agent to comply with all of the requirements of this chapter;

substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters
of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension Due To The Detection Of Illicit Discharge:
1. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized
enforcement agency shall notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The
violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
2. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant
to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 2014-O-048,
