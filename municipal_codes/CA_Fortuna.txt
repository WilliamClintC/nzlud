Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of the sales and use tax; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 345 § 5, 1973).


3.08.080 State law – Adopted by reference.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 345 § 9, 1973).

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the state of California, is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California; the substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the provisions of that code; the substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “state” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this state” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203. (Ord. 345 § 10, 1973).


3.08.100 Additional seller’s permit not required.

3.12.010 Citation of provisions.

This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city. (Code 1961 § 23-10).


3.12.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:

A. “Hotel” means any structure or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended to be designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home, or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, or any space occupied by a recreational vehicle as defined in FMC 17.04.425, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location except when located within a mobile home park, or other similar structure or vehicle or portion thereof.

B. “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms, or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.

C. “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

D. “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

E. “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

F. “Tax administrator” means the city clerk.

G. “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 90-553 § 1; Ord. 78-384. Code 1961 § 23-11).


3.12.030 Imposed – Rate.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel or other structure or any space occupied by a vehicle as defined in FMC 3.12.020(A), each transient is subject to, and shall pay, a tax in the amount of 10 percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. (Ord. 2009-679 § 2; Ord. 90-553 § 2; Ord. 83-470 § 1; Ord. 78-389. Code 1961 § 23-12).


3.12.035 Funds for tourism promotion.

Each year by March 15th, in accordance with Measure W (passed on November 5, 2002), the city of Fortuna shall remit to the Fortuna Chamber of Commerce 10 percent of the total TOT collected for the previous calendar year. The funds are to be used by the Fortuna Chamber of Commerce for the promotion of tourism.

The city of Fortuna and Fortuna Chamber of Commerce shall enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding the administration and oversight of the public’s monies which have been allocated to the Chamber of Commerce for the promotion of tourism. (Ord. 2009-679 § 2).


3.12.040 Collection required.

Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided under this chapter. (Code 1961 § 23-14).


3.12.050 Registration certificate – Required – Contents.

A. Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30 days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

B. Such certificate shall, among other things, state as follows:

1. Name of the operator;

2. The address of the hotel;

3. The date upon which the certificate was issued;

4. “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face thereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administration for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, not to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Code 1961 § 23-15).


3.12.060 Reports and remittances.

Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. (Code 1961 § 23-16).


3.12.070 Failure to promptly remit tax – Penalties.

A. Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

B. Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the tax and the 10 percent penalty first imposed.

C. Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections (A) and (B) of this section.

D. Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid.

E. Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax required to be paid under this chapter. (Code 1961 § 23-17).


3.12.080 Assessments against operators – Notice and hearing.

A. If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due.

B. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter.

C. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.

D. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed.

E. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in this chapter. (Code 1961 § 23-18).


3.12.090 Appeals.

Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing notice of appeal with the city clerk within 15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The city council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in FMC 3.12.080 for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of the notice. (Code 1961 § 23-19).


3.12.100 Recordkeeping.

It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. (Code 1961 § 23-20).


3.12.110 Refunds.

A. Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections (B) and (C) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator.

B. An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.

C. A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (B) of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.

D. No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. (Code 1961 § 23-21).


3.12.120 Tax deemed debt to city – Action by city to collect.

Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. (Code 1961 § 23-22).


3.12.130 Violation – Penalty.

A. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than $500.00 or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.

B. Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as set forth in subsection (A) of this section. Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as set forth in subsection (A) of this section.

“Operative date” means the first day of the first calendar quarter commencing more than 110 days after the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter and approval by the voters. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.030 Purpose.

This chapter is adopted to achieve the following, among other purposes, and directs that the provisions hereof be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:

A. To impose a retail transactions and use tax in accordance with the provisions of Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code and Section 7285.9 of Part 1.7 of Division 2 which authorizes the city to adopt this tax ordinance which shall be operative if a majority of the electors voting on the measure vote to approve the imposition of the tax at an election called for that purpose.

B. To adopt a retail transaction and use tax ordinance that incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

C. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from, the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collection of the California state sales and use taxes.

D. To adopt a retail transactions and use tax ordinance that can be administered in a manner that will be, to the greatest degree possible, consistent with the provision of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting the transactions and use taxes, and at the same time, minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.040 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this transactions and use tax chapter; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.050 Transactions tax rate.

For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is hereby imposed upon all retailers in the incorporated territory of the city at the rate of 0.75 percent per dollar of the gross receipts of any retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in said territory on and after the operative date of this chapter. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.060 Place of sale.

For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from sales include delivery charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.070 Use tax rate.

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use or other consumption in the city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date of this chapter for storage, use or other consumption in said territory at the rate of 0.75 percent per dollar of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.080 Adoption of provisions of state law.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter and except insofar as they are inconsistent with the provision of Part 1.6 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 (commencing with Section 6001) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter as though fully set forth herein. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.090 Limitations on adoption of state law and collection of use taxes.

In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code:

A. Wherever the state of California is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of this city shall be substituted therefor. However, the substitution shall not be made when:

1. The word “State” is used as a part of the title of the State Controller, State Treasurer, State Board of Control, State Board of Equalization, State Treasury, or the Constitution of the state of California.

2. The result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against this city or any agency, officer, or employee thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter.

3. In those sections including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the result of the substitution would be to:

a. Provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provision of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; or

b. Impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provision of that code.

4. In Section 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

B. The word “city” shall be substituted for the word “State” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this State” in Section 6203 and in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.100 Permit not required.

If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional transactor’s permit shall not be required by this chapter. (Ord. 2016-726 § 1).


3.13.110 Exemptions and exclusions.

A. There shall be excluded from the measure of the transactions tax and the use tax the amount of any sales tax or use tax imposed by the state of California or by any city, city and county, or county pursuant to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law or the amount of any state-administered transactions or use tax.

8.24.080 Abatement – Authority.

Upon discovering the existence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on private property or public property within the city, the chief of police shall have the authority to cause the abatement and removal in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this chapter.

8.30.030 Design standards and monitoring systems for new facilities.

No underground storage tank or facility shall be installed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless a permit to operate is first obtained from the permitting authority. A permit to operate shall not be issued for any underground storage tank or facility installed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter unless the underground storage tank or facility meets the following requirements:

A. Be designed and constructed to provide primary and secondary levels of containment of the hazardous substances stored in them in accordance with the following performance standards:

1. Primary containment shall be product-tight,

2. Secondary containment shall be constructed to prevent structural weakening as a result of contact with any released hazardous substances, and also shall be capable of storing, for the maximum anticipated period of time necessary for the recovery of any released hazardous substance,

3. In the case of an installation with one primary container, the secondary containment shall be large enough to contain at least 100 percent of the volume of the primary tank,

4. In the case of multiple primary tanks, the secondary container shall be large enough to contain 150 percent of the volume of the largest primary tank placed in it, or 10 percent of the aggregate internal volume of all primary tanks, whichever is greater,

5. If the facility is open to rainfall, then the secondary containment must be able to additionally accommodate the volume of 24-hour rainfall as determined by a 100-year storm history,

6. Single-walled containers do not fulfill the requirement of an underground storage tank providing both a primary and a secondary containment,

7. The design and construction of underground storage tanks for motor vehicle fuels storage need not meet the requirements of subsections (A)(1) through (A)(6), inclusive of this section, if the primary containment construction is of glass fibre, reinforced plastic, cathodically protected steel, or steel clad with glass fibre reinforced plastic, and any such alternative primary containment is installed in conjunction with a system that will intercept and direct a leak from any part of the tank to a monitoring well to detect any release of motor vehicle fuels stored in the tank and which is designed to provide early leak detection, response, and to protect groundwater from releases, and if the monitoring is in accordance with the alternative method identified in FMC 8.30.040(B)(3). Pressurized piping systems connected to underground storage tanks used for the storage of motor vehicle fuels and monitored in accordance with FMC 8.30.040(B)(3) shall also be deemed to meet the requirements of this subsection;

B. Be designed and constructed with a monitoring system capable of detecting the entry of the hazardous material stored in the primary containment into the secondary containment. If water could intrude into the secondary containment, a means of monitoring for water intrusion and for safely removing the water shall also be provided;

C. When required by the permitting authority, a means of overfill protection for any primary tank, including an overfill prevention device or an attention-getting high level alarm, or both. Primary tank filling operations of underground storage tanks containing motor vehicle fuels which are visually monitored and controlled by a facility operator satisfy the requirements of this subsection;

D. Different substances that in combination may cause a fire or explosion, or the production of flammable, toxic or poisonous gas, or other deterioration of a primary and secondary containment so as to avoid potential intermixing;

E. If water could enter into the secondary containment by precipitation or infiltration, the facility shall contain a means of removing the water by the owner or operator. This removal system shall also provide for a means of analyzing the removed water for hazardous substance contamination and a means of disposing of the water, if so contaminated, at an authorized disposal facility. (Ord. 86-497 § 1 Ex. A).


8.30.040 Monitoring systems for existing facilities.

No underground storage tank or facility installed on or before January 1, 1984, and used for the storage of hazardous substances shall continue to operate unless a permit is obtained by January 1, 1986. No permit to operate such tank or facility shall be issued or remain valid unless the following actions are taken:

A. On or before January 1, 1986, the owner shall outfit the facility with a monitoring system capable of detecting unauthorized releases of any hazardous substances stored in the facility, and thereafter, the operator shall monitor each facility, based on materials stored and the type of monitoring installed.

B. On or before January 1, 1986, the owner shall provide a means for visual inspection of the tank, wherever practical, for the purpose of monitoring required by subsection (A) of this section. Alternative methods of monitoring the tank on a monthly, or more frequent basis, may be required by the permitting authority.

The alternative monitoring methods include, but are not limited to, the following methods:

1. Pressure testing, vacuum testing or hydrostatic testing of the piping systems or underground storage tanks.

2. A groundwater monitoring well or wells which are down gradient and adjacent to the underground storage tank, vapor analysis with a well where appropriate, and analysis of soil borings at the time of initial installation of the well. The permitting authority shall develop regulations specifying monitoring alternatives and shall approve the location and number of wells, the depth of wells and the sampling frequency, pursuant to these regulations.

3. For monitoring tanks containing motor vehicle fuels, daily gauging and inventory reconciliation by the operator, if inventory records are kept on file for one year and are reviewed quarterly, the tank is tested for tightness hydrostatically or, when appropriate with pressure between three and five pounds, inclusive, per square inch at time intervals specified by the State Water Resources Control Board and whenever any pressurized system has a leak detection device for tightness hydrostatically or where appropriate, with pressure between three and five pounds, inclusive, per square inch whenever there is a shortage greater than the amount specified by the State Water Resources Control Board. (Ord. 86-497 § 1 Ex. A).


8.30.050 Abandonment.

A. No person shall abandon an underground storage tank or close or temporarily cease operating an underground storage tank except as provided in this section without first having obtained a permit for the abandonment or closure thereof.

B. An underground storage tank which is temporarily taken out of service, but which the operator intends to return to use, shall continue to be subject to all the permit, inspection and monitoring requirements of this chapter unless the operator complies with the provisions of subsection (C) of this section for the period of time the underground tank is not in use.

C. No person shall close an underground storage tank unless the person undertakes all of the following actions:

1. Demonstrates to the permitting authority that all residual amounts of the hazardous substance or hazardous substances which were stored in the tank prior to its closure have been removed, properly disposed of and neutralized;

2. Adequately seals the tank to minimize any threat to the public safety and the possibility of water intrusion into, or runoff from, the tank;

3. Provides for, and carries out, the maintenance of the tank as permitting authority determines is necessary, for the period of time the permitting authority requires;

4. Demonstrates to the permitting authority that there has been no significant soil contamination resulting from a discharge in the area surrounding the underground storage tank or facility. (Ord. 86-497 § 1 Ex. A).

E. The employees of the city of Fortuna will make every reasonable effort to cooperatively work with property owners, tenants, and neighbors in the elimination of drug houses. It is not the intent to take punitive action against a landlord that is actively attempting to remove tenants that are violating the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 94-593 § 1).


9.20.020 City manager authority to order corrective action by property owners.

A. Whenever the city manager or his designee finds by a preponderance of the evidence in accordance with subsection (B) of this section, that the unlawful sale, storage, manufacturing, selling, or giving away of a controlled substance, precursor or analog as defined in the Health and Safety Code has occurred in or about the premises of any privately owned property, he may order the property owner to take corrective action to abate the activity.

Such corrective action may include, but is not limited to, the hiring of a residence manager or security guard, the installing of secure doors at the front and rear of the buildings, the posting of “no trespassing” signs in and on the property, the development of property rules which regulate the entrance to and egress from the property of nonresidents and the institution of action to remove any resident or others engaging in such illegal conduct on or about the premises.

B. Prior to the city taking such action the city manager shall afford the property owner written notice of the proposed actions, specific documentation (as allowed by law) of the basis therefore, and a reasonable opportunity to respond. No hearing shall be required which evidence is required to be taken.

C. If the property owner is dissatisfied with the city manager’s proposed actions at any time prior to the city’s initiating civil action pursuant to FMC 9.20.030(C), such property owner may appeal to the Fortuna city council. Notice of appeal to the city council shall be made in writing to the city clerk. The written notice shall include a statement of the facts of the appeal and the recommended solution in sufficient detail to enable the city council to understand the nature of the proceedings and the parties concerned. Unless the time is extended by mutual agreement of the parties, the matter shall be placed on the next agenda for a regularly scheduled meeting at which time the city council shall commence its hearing. The city council shall render its decision within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing. The decision shall contain a summary of the evidence, findings of fact, and a statement of the reasons underlying the decision. The city council’s decision shall be sent to the property owner and the city manager. The city council’s decision shall be the final and binding administrative remedy. (Ord. 94-593 § 1).

C. The failure to comply with this order is hereby declared a nuisance and the city attorney, at the direction of the city council, may bring a civil action under this section for injunctive and other relief. Prior to directing the city attorney to commence such a civil action, the city council shall first give notice of such proposed action to the property owner and an opportunity for the property owner to be heard at a regular city council meeting or a city council meeting specially called for that purpose.

D. The unlawful sale, storage, manufacture, selling or giving away of controlled substance, precursor or analog on private property is hereby declared to be a nuisance. Whether or not the city manager orders a private property owner to take corrective action, any person aggrieved by such a nuisance may bring an independent civil action against the private property owner of the property on or about which such activity has occurred for all appropriate relief including damages, costs and attorney fees, which s/he may have incurred as a result of such activity of no less than $500.00.

1. A “person aggrieved” is anyone who owns or occupies any premises that cannot be quietly used and enjoyed due to the unlawful sale, storage, manufacture, selling or giving away of a controlled substance, precursor or analog on or in any property or dwelling unit, other than their own.

2. Every day that a person aggrieved cannot quietly use and enjoy their premises is a separate and distinct nuisance. (Ord. 94-593 § 1).

The city council finds that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the city of Fortuna and that such behavior has become disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses. It has also contributed to the loss of access to and enjoyment of places open to the public and has created an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder.

C. The city council finds that solicitation from people in places where they are a “captive audience” in which it is impossible or difficult for them to exercise their own right to decline to listen to or to avoid solicitation from others is problematic and presents a risk to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Such places include public transportation vehicles and their designated locations for stops, as well as gasoline stations.

D. The city council finds that solicitation on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians and the general public. Soliciting on roadway median strips, at traffic intersections, and in the public roadway increases the risk of drivers becoming distracted from their primary duty to watch traffic which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.

E. The city council finds that the practice of solicitation near driveways accessing shopping centers, retail, and business establishments is unsafe and hazardous for solicitors, drivers, pedestrians and the general public. The location of the solicitor near the driveway compromises the solicitor’s safety, impedes visibility, and impairs a driver’s ability to safely enter and exit. Drivers also become distracted which may result in automobile accidents, congestion and blockage of streets, delay and obstruction of the free flow of travel, all of which constitute substantial traffic safety problems.

F. This law is timely and appropriate because current laws are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. The restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest. Furthermore, in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city council recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives, which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this law. The goal of this law is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the city of Fortuna. (Ord. 2016-723 § 2).

The California Vehicle Code (Section 22352) establishes a “prima facie” speed limit of 25 miles per hour “on any highway other than a state highway, in any business or residence district unless a different speed is determined by local authority under procedures set forth in this code.” The Vehicle Code authorizes local jurisdictions to increase or decrease the prima facie speed limits based upon an Engineering and Traffic Survey when it will “facilitate the orderly movement of vehicular traffic and would be reasonable and safe upon any street other than a state highway,” provided the local jurisdiction has adopted an ordinance to that effect. (Ord. 11-689 § 2; Ord. 2003-639 § 1; Ord. 97-608 § 1; Ord. 97-605 § 1; Ord. 79-419 § 1).


10.52.020 Establishing speed zones.

Whenever the city traffic engineer determines and recommends, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic survey, that a speed greater or less than the prima facie or maximum speed limit otherwise established by the California Vehicle Code is reasonable and safe upon any local street, the city council may, by resolution, increase or decrease speed limits in accordance with Sections 32, 22357, 22358 and 22358.3 of the California Vehicle Code, or other authorization of general state law. Prima facie or maximum speed limits established pursuant to this chapter shall be effective when appropriate signs giving notice thereof are erected upon the affected street. (Ord. 11-689 § 2; Ord. 2003-639 § 1; Ord. 97-608 § 1; Ord. 97-605 § 1; Ord. 79-419 § 2).

C. Upon the expiration of the suspension period, the city will make connections to its water system in accordance with its regulations and the terms of connection agreements for all said applications approved during the suspension period. The water supply then available to the city will be apportioned equitably among all the customers then being served by the city without discrimination against services approved during the suspension period.

D. Nothing herein shall prohibit or restrict any modification, relocation or replacement of a connection to the city’s system if the city manager determines that the demand upon the city’s water supply will not be increased thereby. (Ord. 2014-714 § 2 (Exh. A)).


13.13.075 Variances.

Applications for a variance from the provisions of FMC 13.13.070 may be made to the city manager. The city manager may grant a variance to permit a use of water otherwise prohibited by FMC 13.13.070 if the city manager determines that the variance is reasonably necessary to protect the public health and safety and/or economic viability of commercial operation.

13.36.060 Availability of city facilities.

If sewerage capacity is not available, the city may require the industrial wastewater discharger to restrict his discharge until sufficient capacity can be made available. When requested, the city will advise persons desiring to locate new facilities as to the areas where industrial wastewater of their proposed quantity and quality can be received by available sewerage facilities. The city may refuse service to persons locating facilities in areas where their proposed quantity or quality of industrial wastewater is unacceptable in the available treatment facility. (Ord. 76-360 § 707).


13.36.070 Prohibited industrial waste discharges.

A. Requirement.

1. It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge wastewater into the city’s POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the city manager. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the enforcement actions set out in this chapter. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of their obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law.

2. The city manager may require other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

B. Existing Connections. Any significant industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW prior to the effective date of this chapter and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall, within 45 days after said date, apply to the city for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with FMC 13.36.020, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the city.

C. New Connections. Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to discharging. An application for this wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least 45 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin.

D. Extra Jurisdictional Industrial Users. The city may enter into an agreement with the neighboring jurisdiction in which the significant industrial user is located to provide for the implementation and enforcement of pretreatment program requirements against said industrial user.

E. Zero discharge permit may be issued to industrial users generating process wastewaters who would normally be subject to either FMC 13.36.180 or subject to categorical pretreatment standards under 40 CFR Section 403.6 and 40 CFR Chapter I, Subpart N, but are not discharging said waste stream(s) to the system. Zero discharge permit holders are subject to all applicable regulations under federal, state, local, or laws. Pursuant to this chapter, a statement of zero discharge must be submitted to the city annually. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1); Ord. 76-360 § 706).


13.36.080 Pretreatment of industrial wastewaters.

A. Whenever deemed necessary, the city manager may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the industrial user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

B. All pretreatment systems or devices shall be approved by the city engineer but such approval shall not absolve the industrial discharger of the responsibility of meeting any industrial effluent limitation required by the city. All pretreatment systems judged by the city engineer to require engineering design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed in the state.

C. Normally, a gravity separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber and control manhole will be required, respectively, to remove prohibited settleable and clotable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and/or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flows, and to facilitate inspection, flow measurement and sampling.

D. Floor drains from commercial or manufacturing buildings, warehouses or multiuse structures shall not discharge directly to the sewer, but shall first discharge to a gravity separation interceptor.

E. Each user discharging into the POTW greater than 100,000 gallons per day shall install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow over a 24-hour period.

F. Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

G. At no time shall any reading on a properly calibrated combustible gas detector at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be more than 20 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2, 2019; Ord. 76-360 § 708).


13.36.090 Control manhole and separation of domestic and industrial wastewaters.

A. All domestic or sanitary wastewaters from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains, etc., shall be kept separate from all industrial wastewaters until the industrial wastewaters have passed through any required pretreatment system or device.

B. A control manhole of a design approved by the city engineer shall be furnished and installed by certain designated industrial wastewater dischargers to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow measurements by personnel of the city. This control manhole shall be located off the industrial premises or, if within the plant fence, a special locked gate adjacent to the manhole and at a location approved by the city shall be provided, with keys to the gate lock given to the city. Unrestricted access to this control manhole shall be available to authorized personnel of the city at all times. The control manhole may be used as a junction manhole for domestic sewage and industrial wastes provided the junction occurs downstream of the sampling or flow measuring point. (Ord. 76-360 § 709).


13.36.100 Industrial wastewater sampling, analysis and flow measurements.

A. Periodic measurements of flow rates, flow volumes, COD, and suspended solids for use in determining the annual industrial wastewater treatment charge and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary by the city engineer shall be made by all industrial wastewater dischargers unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the city engineer.

B. All wastewater analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedure contained in “standard methods.” If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the industry or a procedure judged satisfactory by the city engineer shall be used to measure wastewater constituents.

C. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determined under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing significant industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards, and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (B) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (B) of this section. A new source shall also be required to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.

D. The industrial user shall submit the information required by this section including:

1. Identifying Information. The name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners.

2. Wastewater Discharge Permits. A list of any environmental control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the facility.

3. Description of Operations. A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.

4. Flow Measurement. Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined waste stream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).

5. Measurement of Pollutants.

a. Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process.

b. Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (and/or mass where required by the standard or by the city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operation and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in FMC 13.36.300.

c. Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in this section.

6. Certification. A statement reviewed by the industrial user’s authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.

7. Compliance Schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in FMC 13.36.200, and be signed by an authorized representative as defined in FMC 13.24.320.

8. Signature and Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this chapter.

E. Sample Collection.

1. Except as indicated in subsections (E)(2) and (3) of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

2. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

3. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in FMC 13.36.220 and 13.36.230, a minimum of four grab samples must be collected for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the city manager may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by FMC 13.36.240 the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

F. Determination of Noncompliance. The city manager may use grab samples to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1); Ord. 76-360 § 710).


13.36.110 Damage caused by prohibited wastewater discharge.

Any industrial wastewater discharger who discharges or causes the discharge of prohibited wastewaters which cause damage to city facilities, detrimental effects on treatment processes, or any other damages resulting in costs to the city shall be liable to the city for all damages occasioned thereby. (Ord. 76-360 § 711).


13.36.120 Pretreatment facilities.

Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the city manager, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user’s expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedure shall be submitted to the city for review, and must be approved by the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.130 Accidental discharge/slug control plans.

The city manager may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years the city manager shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan, which provides at a minimum the following:

A. Description of discharge practices including nonroutine batch discharges.

B. Description of stored chemicals.

C. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in FMC 13.32.020 through 13.32.150.

D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

E. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any changes affecting the potential for a slug discharge. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.140 Tenant responsibility.

Where an owner of property lets premises to any other person as a tenant, if either the owner or the tenant is a commercial or industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this chapter. This provision is enforceable against the owner, the tenant or both, without regard to any contractual arrangements between the owner and tenant. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.150 Hauled wastewater.

A. Septic tank waste of residential origin may be accepted into the POTW at a designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, and at such times as are established by the city manager, provided such wastes do not violate the provisions of this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city. Wastewater discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued by, and at the discretion of, the city manager, based on the interests and purposes to be served under this chapter.

B. The discharge of hauled industrial wastes is prohibited without prior approval and a wastewater discharge permit from the city.

C. Fees for dumping septage will be established as part of the industrial user fee system as authorized in this chapter. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

13.36.170 Waste survey.

When requested by the city manager, all industrial users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to commencing their discharge. The city manager is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be considered a violation of this chapter, or for imposing penalties as set out in FMC 13.60.180. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.180 Wastewater discharge permit decisions.

The city manager will evaluate the data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional information. Within 45 days of receipt of a completed wastewater discharge permit application, the city manager will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit and will notify the industrial user. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.190 Duration of permit – Reissuance.

A. Wastewater discharge permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years, at the discretion of the city manager. Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.

B. All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.

C. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedure prescribed in FMC 13.36.100(E), the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.250 Reports of changed conditions.

Each industrial user is required to notify the city manager of any planned significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 45 days before the change.

A. The city manager may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application.

B. No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions until and unless the city manager has responded to the industrial user’s notice.

C. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed significant. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.260 Reports of potential problems.

A. In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharge of nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards of this chapter), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective action taken by the industrial user.

B. Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter.

C. Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this chapter.

D. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (A) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.270 Reports from nonsignificant industrial users.

All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the city manager may require. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.280 Notice of violation – Repeat sampling and reporting.

If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user’s facility at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user’s initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of the sampling. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.290 Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.

A. Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the names of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 10 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent information is known and readily available to the industrial users: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 30 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection (A) need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under FMC 13.36.250. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of FMC 13.36.220, 13.36.230, and 13.36.240.

B. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.

C. In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical.

D. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.300 Analytical requirements.

All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.36.310 Recordkeeping.

Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this chapter. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this chapter, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

13.60.110 Compliance monitoring.

A. Inspection and Sampling. The city manager shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter, and any permit or order issued hereunder, is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof. Industrial users shall allow the city manager or his representatives ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

1. Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangement with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel for the city, state, and EPA shall be permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.

2. The city, state, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.

3. The city may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. The monitoring equipment should normally be situated on the user’s premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that the facility will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated yearly to ensure their accuracy.

4. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the industrial user.

5. Unreasonable delays in allowing city personnel access to the industrial user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

6. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city, unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city.

B. Search Warrants. If the city manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property or any part thereof, and if the city manager has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city attorney may apply to the appropriate court for a search, inspection and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant in accordance with law. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.120 Publication of industrial users in significant noncompliance.

The city shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the significant industrial users and categorical industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:

A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l);

B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);

C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(l) (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);

D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment or has resulted in the city’s exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;

E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;

F. Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, 90-day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;

G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and

H. Any other violation which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.130 Administrative enforcement remedies.

A. Notification of Violation. Whenever the city manager finds that any person has violated or is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city manager or his agent may serve upon said person a written notice of violation. Within seven days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the person to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the person of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

A warning NOV is a verbal or written communication between the city manager and the industrial user regarding possible enforcement action for potential or actual noncompliance by the industrial user. The city manager must document the warning in writing and place a copy of the documentation in the user’s file.

B. Consent Orders. The city manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (D) and (E) of this section and shall be judicially enforceable.

C. Show Cause Hearing. The city manager may order a person which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the city manager and show cause as to why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the person show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least seven days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the person as defined in FMC 13.24.320 and required by FMC 13.36.020(B). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the person.

D. Compliance Orders. When the city finds that a person has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city may issue an order to the person responsible for the discharge directing that the person come into compliance within 30 days. If the person does not come into compliance within 30 days, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release the person of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the person.

E. Cease and Desist Orders.

1. When the city manager finds that a person is violating this chapter, the person’s wastewater discharge permit, any order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the person’s past violations are likely to recur, the city manager may issue an order to the person directing the person to cease and desist all such violations and directing the person to:

a. Immediately comply with all requirements; and

b. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

2. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the person.

F. Administrative Fine.

1. Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any person that is found to have violated any provision of this chapter, its wastewater discharge permit, and orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, may be fined in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines may be assessed for each day during the period of violation.

2. Assessments may be added to the person’s next scheduled sewer service charge and the city manager shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for other service charges and fees.

3. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 10 percent of the unpaid balance and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 0.5 percent per month. A lien against the individual person’s property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.

4. Persons desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager shall convene a hearing on the matter within 30 days of receiving the request from the industrial person. In the event the person’s appeal is successful, the payment together with any interest accruing thereto shall be returned to the industrial person. The city may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the fine.

5. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against the person.

G. Emergency Suspensions.

1. The city manager may immediately suspend a person’s discharge (after informal notice to the person) whenever such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The city manager may also immediately suspend a person’s discharge (after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.

a. Any person notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a person’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city manager shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager shall allow the person to recommence their discharge when the person has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in this chapter are initiated against the person.

b. A person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the city manager, prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing as set forth in this chapter.

2. Nothing in this subsection (G) shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

H. Termination of Discharge.

1. In addition to those provisions in FMC 13.36.050, any person that violates the following conditions of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, is subject to discharge termination:

a. Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;

b. Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

c. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge;

d. Refusal of reasonable access to the person’s premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;

e. Violation of the pretreatment standards in FMC 13.32.020 through 13.32.150.

2. Such person will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (C) of this section why the proposed action should not be taken. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.140 Judicial enforcement remedies.

A. Injunctive Relief. Whenever the person has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, the city may petition the Superior Court for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such violation. In any such action, the city shall be entitled to recover, in addition to other costs and damages, an amount for reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys’ fees.

B. Civil Penalties.

1. Any person which has violated or continues to violate this chapter, any order, or wastewater discharge permit hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $6,000 per violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.

2. The city may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city.

3. When a discharge of wastes causes an obstruction, damage, or other impairment to the POTW, the city may assess a charge against the person for the cost of the work required to clean or repair the POTW and add such charge to the person’s service charge.

4. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against a person. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.150 Supplemental enforcement action.

A. Water Supply Severance. Whenever a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, orders, or wastewater discharge permits issued in this chapter, water service to the person may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the person’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.

B. Public Nuisances. Any violation of this chapter, wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the city manager or his designee. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of applicable state and city codes, ordinances, rules and/or regulations governing such nuisances, including recoupment by the city of any costs incurred in removing, abating or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.160 Remedies nonexclusive.

The provisions in FMC 13.60.120 through 13.60.150 are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. However, the city reserves the right to take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the city is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. These actions may be taken concurrently. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.170 Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.

A. Upset.

1. For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

2. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (A)(3) of this section are met.

3. An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that:

a. An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

b. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures;

c. The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):

i. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.

ii. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.

iii. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

4. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

5. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.

6. The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

B. Bypass.

1. For the purposes of this section:

a. “Bypass” shall mean the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user’s treatment facility.

b. “Severe property damage” shall mean substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.

2. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (B)(3) and (4) of this section.

3. Bypass Notification.

a. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible.

b. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.

4. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:

a. Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage;

b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

c. The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (B)(3) of this section.

i. The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (B)(4) of this section. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).


13.60.180 Penalty.

A. Any person that willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, any orders, or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirement, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.

B. Any person that willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $500.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.

C. Any person that knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit or order, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $500.00 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than one year or both.

D. In the event of a second conviction, a person shall be punished by a fine of not more than $2,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not more than two years or both. (Ord. 2019-735 § 2 (Exh. 1)).

C. The notice given by the superintendent of public works to provide the required underground facilities shall particularly specify what work is required to be done, and shall state that if the work is not completed within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the superintendent of public works will provide such required underground facilities, in which case the cost and expense thereof will be assessed against the property benefited and become a lien upon such property.

D. If upon the expiration of the 30-day period, the required underground facilities have not been provided, the superintendent of public works shall forthwith proceed to do the work; provided, however, if the premises are unoccupied and no electric or communications services are being furnished thereto, the superintendent of public works shall, in lieu of providing the required underground facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying utility service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the superintendent of public works, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place for hearing protests against the assessment of the cost of such work upon such premises, which time shall not be less than 10 days thereafter.

E. The superintendent of public works shall forthwith, upon the time for hearing such protests having been fixed, give a notice in writing to the person in possession of such premises, and a notice in writing thereof to the owner thereof, in the manner provided in subsection (B) of this section for the giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear protests against such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount of the proposed assessment.

F. Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there are any, and then proceed to affirm, modify, or reject the assessment.

G. If any assessment is not paid within five days after its confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien upon the property against which the assessment is made by the superintendent of public works, and the superintendent of public works is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax collector a notice of lien on each of the properties on which the assessment has not been paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises upon which the assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due and payable at the same time as the property taxes are due and payable and, if not paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per year. (Ord. 313 § 9, 1969).


13.68.095 Alternative procedures.

A. As an alternative procedure to that described in FMC 13.68.090, the city may direct the supplying utilities to engineer, construct, and provide that portion of the service connection on the private property between the facilities referred to in FMC 13.68.080 and the termination facility on or within the building or structure being served, all in accordance with the applicable rules, regulations, and tariffs of the respective utility or utilities on file with the commission.

B. Any portion of the work that will not be completed by the supplying utility shall be completed by the affected person owning, operating, leasing, occupying, or renting a building or structure within the district.

C. When using this alternative procedure, if any work remains to be done by the private property owner, the procedures described in FMC 13.68.090 shall control. (Ord. 2013-703 § 2).


13.68.100 Responsibility of city.

Chapter 13.90 COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION

Sections:

13.90.010    Findings and purpose.

13.90.020    Participation in community choice aggregation.


13.90.010 Findings and purpose.

A. The California Public Utilities Code under Chapter 2.3 of Division 1, Part 1 allows electric utility customers to aggregate their electric loads as members of their local community with community choice aggregators, where a community choice aggregator may be any city, county, or group of cities or counties who have elected to combine the loads of their programs through the formation of a joint powers agency established under Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 6500) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the California Government Code.

B. The city of Fortuna has been investigating options to provide electric services to constituents within its service areas with the intent of achieving greater local involvement over the provisions of electric services, competitive electric rates, the development of clean, local renewable energy projects, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and the wider implementation of energy conservation and efficiency projects and programs through a community choice aggregation (CCA) program.

C. The city of Fortuna is a member of the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (RCEA), a joint powers authority formed by the county of Humboldt, cities of Arcata, Blue Lake, Eureka, Ferndale, Fortuna and Rio Dell, Trinidad and the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District, to act as a regional agency to promote sustainable energy initiatives that reduce energy demand, increase energy efficiency, and advance the use of clean, efficient and renewable resources available in the region.

D. The RCEA is authorized by ordinance to act as a community choice aggregator to implement and operate a CCA program under California law.

E. RCEA has established key CCA program goals of maximizing the use of local renewable resources while also providing competitive rates to customers. These goals are aimed at supporting local economic development as well as reducing the environmental impacts resulting from the use of electricity in a technically and economically feasible manner.

F. To analyze the feasibility of operating a CCA program that achieves these goals, RCEA is currently in the process of procuring technical support services/has retained independent technical support services to conduct the appropriate development and operational studies, including technical, financial and risk analyses. These studies will assist RCEA, its member agencies, and the community in evaluating a potential rate structure and energy portfolio, and, ultimately, potential CCA program viability prior to formal launch of a CCA program through the filing of an implementation plan with the CPUC.

G. Participation in a CCA program implemented and operated by the RCEA, rather than independently electing to become a community choice aggregator, will reduce the city’s financial exposure from community choice aggregation, if any, because RCEA’s joint power authority structure immunizes its member agencies from its debts, liabilities and obligations, and therefore the debts, liabilities and obligations of a CCA program.

H. Electric customers have the right to opt out of the CCA program and continue to receive service from the existing utility under Cal. Pub. Util. Code Section 366.2.

I. Under the RCEA CCA program structure, the city will have CCA program voting privileges on the RCEA board of directors as set out in the RCEA Amended and Restated Joint Powers Agreement effective December 15, 2015. (Ord. 2016-721 § 1).


13.90.020 Participation in community choice aggregation.

Based on all of the above, the city council of the city of Fortuna elects to implement a community choice aggregation program within the city’s jurisdiction by and through the RCEA, subject to the determination of the RCEA, based on its CCA program developmental and operational analyses and member agency input, that a CCA program based on the key goals set out above is not technically or economically feasible and consequently decides not to launch the CCA program. (Ord. 2016-721 § 1).

“Franchise fee.” In consideration of the grant and exercise of a franchise to construct, install, operate, or provide services using a cable communications system in the public rights-of-way, a grantee shall pay to the city a franchise fee expressed as a percentage of gross revenues. The franchise shall specify the fee to be paid, and the gross revenues to be included in the fee calculation. If a franchise granted pursuant to this title specifies a franchise fee established as the result of limiting applicable law, the city shall have the option to renegotiate the amount of the franchise fee upon a change in applicable law. Nothing herein requires a person to pay amounts in excess of any limits that may be established by state or federal law.

“Gross revenues” means all cash, credits, property, or other consideration of any kind or nature received directly or indirectly by a grantee or its affiliates, from any source whatsoever, arising from, attributable to, or in any way derived from a grantee’s operation of a cable system within the franchise area. Gross revenues include, but are not limited to, fees charged to subscribers for basic service; fees charged to subscribers for any optional, premium, per-channel, or per-program service; monthly fees charged to subscribers for any tier of service other than basic service; installation, disconnection, re-connection, and change-in-service fees; leased channel fees; fees, payments, or other payment received as consideration from programmers for carriage of programming on the cable system; converter rentals or sales; studio rental, production equipment, and personnel fees; advertising revenues, including a per capita share of advertising revenues for advertising carried on more than one cable system; revenues from home shopping channels; sales of programming guides; and such other revenue sources as may now exist or hereafter develop. The definition shall be interpreted in a manner which permits the city to collect the maximum franchise fee permitted by law, irrespective of the source of revenue. Gross revenues, however, shall not include any bad debt (defined as unpaid subscriber or advertiser accounts), any taxes on services furnished to a grantee and imposed directly upon any subscriber or user by the state, city, or other governmental unit and collected by a grantee on behalf of said governmental unit. The amount paid as a franchise fee shall not be deducted from gross revenues unless required to be deducted under federal law. 

“License” refers to the legal authorization, terminable at will, to use a particular, discrete, and limited portion of the public rights-of-way to construct, operate, or repair a communications facility. 

“Operator,” when used with reference to a system, refers to a person or group of persons (a) who provides service over a cable communications system and directly or through one or more affiliates owns a significant interest in such cable communication system; or (b) who otherwise controls or is responsible for, through any arrangement, the management and operation of such a cable communication system facility.

“OVS” means an open video system within the meaning of federal law. A reference to an OVS includes pedestals, equipment enclosures (such as equipment cabinets), amplifiers, power guards, nodes, cables, fiber optics and other equipment necessary to operate the OVS, or installed in conjunction with the OVS.

“Person” includes any individual, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, or any other legal entity, but not the city.

“Public property” means any property that is owned or under the control of the city that is not a public right-of-way, including, for purposes of this title, but not limited to, buildings, parks, poles, structures in the public rights-of-way such as utility poles and light poles, or similar facilities or property owned by or leased to the city.

“Public rights-of-way” means the surface of and the space above and below any street, road, highway, freeway, bridge, lane, path, alley, court, sidewalk, parkway, drive, or right-of-way or easement dedicated for compatible uses, now or hereafter existing within the city which may be properly used for the purpose of installing, maintaining, and operating a cable communications system; and any other property that a franchisee is entitled by state or federal law to use by virtue of the grant of a franchise. 

“Revocation” means the city’s affirmative act of terminating a franchise.

“School” means any accredited primary school, secondary school, college, and university.

“Subscriber” means the city or any person who is lawfully receiving, for any purpose or reason, any cable service via a cable communications system, whether or not a fee is paid for such service.

“Termination” means the conclusion of a franchise by any means, including, but not limited to, by expiration of its term, abandonment, or revocation.

“Transfer” means any transaction in which: (1) all or a portion of any cable communication system or any rights to use or operate facilities located in the public rights-of-way are sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned, encumbered (except as set forth herein) or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by one or more transactions to another person, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or otherwise; or (2) there is any change, acquisition, or transfer in the identity of the person in control of the grantee, or any person that controls the grantee, including, without limitation, forced or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, or receivership; or (3) the rights or obligations under the franchise are sold, conveyed, transferred, assigned, encumbered (except as set forth herein) or leased, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by one or more transactions to another person, whether voluntarily or by operation of law or otherwise. It will be presumed, for purposes of clause (2) above, that any transfer or cumulative transfer of a voting interest by a person or group of persons acting in concert of 10 percent or more of the grantee, or person that controls the grantee, or any change in the managing general partners of a grantee is a change of control. “Transfer” does not include: (1) a lease of channel capacity pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Sections 532 or 573; (2) the transmission of a commodity or electronic signal using facilities on a common carrier basis; (3) a lease or other right to use the cable communications system mandated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 224; or (4) a pledge in trust, mortgage or other encumbrance against the cable communications system, or any portion thereof, given to a bona fide institutional lender in connection with a loan or other financing required to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the cable communications system (“loan”) provided that such loan is subject to the rights and powers of the city pursuant to the franchise and applicable law, including, without limitation, the right of the city to approve any transfer upon foreclosure. “Transferring” and “transferee” shall have correlative meanings.

“Upstream channel” means a channel designed and activated to carry transmissions from a point on the cable communications system, other than the headend, to the headend or another point on the cable communications system. 

“User” means a person or the city utilizing a channel, capacity or equipment and facilities for purposes of producing or transmitting material, as contrasted with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.1)).

14.04.040 Failure to obtain a franchise.

Consistent with the requirements of due process, a person’s failure to obtain a franchise as required by this title may, in the city’s discretion, result in:

B. A requirement that the cable communication system be removed, and that penalties and damages be paid. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.4)).


14.04.050 Existing franchises.

Grantees of franchises existing as of the effective date of this title shall, in addition to all the obligations and duties prescribed by the terms of their existing franchises, be subject to the substantive and procedural requirements herein, except as prohibited by applicable law. Nothing herein is intended to invalidate a lawful, existing franchise or to waive any obligations imposed by such a franchise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provisions of this title that expressly refer to a “franchise granted pursuant to this title” shall not apply to franchises initially granted prior to the effective date of this title. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.5)).


14.04.060 Form of franchise. 

A franchise shall be issued in the form of written agreement, approved by resolution of the city council, and must be accepted by the franchisee to become effective. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.6)).


14.04.070 Filing an application.

A person seeking to (1) obtain a franchise, (2) transfer a franchise, (3) extend the term of an existing franchise, (4) renew a franchise, or (5) modify an existing franchise to add new services that are required to be authorized by a franchise pursuant to this title, shall submit a signed original of its application and six copies to the city manager. The city manager shall make a proposal available for public inspection. The application must conform to all of the requirements of this title. Requests for other types of franchise modifications may be processed by the city without an application, and submitted for approval. However, nothing herein shall prevent the city from requiring an application in the event the city determines, based on the nature of the requested modification, that the public interest would best be served by the submission of an application pursuant to this title. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.7)).


14.04.080 Application fee.

A. Reasonable Costs. An applicant shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city related to the processing of any application. Processing costs shall include, but not be limited to, the costs of services rendered by any city employee, agent or representative, including consultants and attorneys.

The city of Fortuna may, as costs are incurred, draw upon the deposit to recover its administrative costs, including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of outside consultants retained by the city related to the city’s consideration and processing of a franchise or license. The city manager, at any time, may require the applicant to deposit additional sums if it appears that the initial deposit or subsequent deposits will be exhausted prior to the final action by the city relating to the consideration by the city of an application for issuance, renewal, transfer, or modification of a franchise or license. The applicant will not be entitled to further consideration by the city of Fortuna of its requested action until such time as the additional deposit required by the city manager has been deposited with the city.

In addition, an applicant that is awarded a franchise or a license shall pay the city a sum of money sufficient to reimburse it for all publication expenses incurred by it in connection with the granting of a franchise or license. Such payment shall be made to the auditor-controller of the city within 30 days after the city furnishes the franchisee or licensee with a statement of such expenses. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.8)).


14.04.090 Nature of franchise.

A. Scope. A franchise granted pursuant to this title shall authorize and permit a franchisee to construct, operate, maintain and repair a cable system, or an OVS (as applicable) to provide cable service in the city, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain facilities appurtenant to such system in, on, over, under, upon, across, and along the public rights-of-way, and along such other public property that the city may authorize a franchisee to use.

B. Nothing Passes by Implication. A franchise shall not convey rights other than as specified in this title, or in a franchise agreement; no rights shall pass by implication. 

C. Franchise Not in Lieu of Other Authorizations. A franchise shall not include, or be a substitute for: 

1. Compliance with requirements for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the city, including, but not limited to, complying with the conditions the city may establish before constructing facilities for, or providing, non-cable services;

2. Any permit, agreement or authorization required in connection with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including by way of example and not limitation, encroachment permits for street construction; 

3. Any permits or agreements for occupying any other property of the city or private entities to which access is not specifically granted by the franchise. 

D. Franchisee Must Comply with Other Laws. A franchise does not relieve a franchisee of its duty to comply with all the city ordinances and regulations, and every franchisee must comply with the same. Likewise, the rights granted under a franchise are subject to the exercise of police and other powers the city now has or may later obtain, including but not limited to the power of eminent domain. Every franchise shall be deemed to incorporate all the requirements of the city charter.

E. Franchise Not a Grant of Property Rights. A franchise does not convey title, equitable or legal, in the public rights-of-way. Rights granted may not be subdivided or subleased. 

F. Franchise Nonexclusive. No franchise shall be exclusive, or prevent the city from issuing other franchises or authorizations, or prevent the city from itself constructing, operating, or repairing its own cable communications system with or without a franchise. 

G. Franchise Term. Every franchise shall be for a term of years, which term shall be eight years, unless a franchise specifies otherwise.

H. Costs Borne by Franchisee. Unless otherwise specifically stated in a franchise, or is required or permitted by law, all acts which a franchisee is required to perform under the franchise or applicable law must be performed at the franchisee’s expense.

I. Failures to Perform. If a cable communications system operator fails to perform work that it is required to perform within the time provided for performance, the city may perform the work and bill the operator therefor. The operator shall pay the amounts billed within 30 days. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.9)).


14.04.100 Administration of ordinance – Adoption of regulations.

A. Adoption of Regulations. The city of Fortuna may from time to time adopt regulations to implement the provisions of the ordinance codified in this title. The ordinance codified in this title, and any regulations adopted pursuant to the ordinance codified in this title, are not contracts with any franchisee, and may be amended at any time. Nothing in this section shall affect a franchisee’s right to challenge the lawfulness or applicability of a future exercise of the police or legislative power of the city.

B. Delegation. The city of Fortuna city manager or their designee(s) are hereby authorized to administer the provisions of the ordinance codified in this title and any franchise issued pursuant thereto, and to provide any notices (including noncompliance notices) and to take any action on the city’s behalf that may be required hereunder or under applicable law.

C. No Waiver. The failure of the city, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under a franchise or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance, unless such right has been specifically waived in writing.

D. Administration of Public, Educational and Government Access. The city may designate one or more entities, including itself, to control and manage the use of public, educational and government access channels, facilities and equipment. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.10)).


14.04.110 Transfers. 

A. Prior Approval Required. Every franchise shall be deemed to be held in trust, and to be personal to the franchisee. Any transfer that is made without the prior approval of the city shall be deemed invalid. 

B. Exception for Mortgages. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable communications system to secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be made without application and without the city’s prior consent. However, no such arrangement may be made without the city’s prior consent if it would in any respect, under any condition: (1) prevent the cable communications system operator or any successor from complying with the franchise or applicable law; or (2) permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the system, without the prior consent of the city. Any mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of the city under any franchise, this title, or other applicable law. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.11)).


14.04.120 General conditions upon construction, operation and repair.

A. Franchisee Must Follow Local Rules. The construction, operation, and repair of cable communications systems shall be performed in compliance with all lawful and applicable laws, ordinances, departmental rules, regulations, and practices affecting such system. By way of example, and not limitation, this includes zoning and safety codes, construction standards, regulations for providing notice to persons that may be affected by system construction, and directives governing the time, place and manner in which facilities may be installed in the public rights-of-way. Persons engaged in the construction, operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property. 

B. No Permit Without Franchise. A franchise is required before a permit may be issued for work associated with the construction of a cable communications system. Any permit issued for such work to, or on behalf of, a person that does not hold a franchise shall vest no rights in the permittee; the permit may be revoked at will, and the permittee shall remove all facilities installed under the permit upon the city’s demand.

C. Permits Must Be Obtained. Construction, operation, or repair of a cable communications system shall not commence until all required permits have been obtained from the proper city officials and all required fees have been paid. All work performed will be performed in strict accordance with the conditions of the permit. Upon order of the city, any work and/or construction undertaken that is not completed in compliance with the city’s requirements, or which is installed without obtaining necessary permits and approvals shall be removed.

D. No Interference. Interference with the use of the public rights-of-way by others, including others that may be installing cable communications systems, must be minimized. The city may require a person using the public rights-of-way to cooperate with others through joint trenching and other arrangements to minimize adverse impacts on the public rights-of-way. 

E. Plans For and Publicizing Work. Work shall be publicized as the city may direct from time to time. The publication of work may be used to notify the public and operators of other communications systems, of the impending work, in order to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the public.

1. Each cable communications system operator shall provide the city a plan for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, and the areas of the city that will be affected.

2. The city may from time to time, when the city receives application for a permit to use a particular route, or upon its own initiative, designate by published order a route or proposed route for installation of communications facilities and may (1) require all persons who wish to emplace underground facilities along that route or any part thereof to install them during a specified period and (2) otherwise prohibit emplacement of such facilities along the route or any part thereof for 24 months or after such other, longer period as is necessary to protect the public interest. 

F. Existing Poles to Be Used. To the extent possible, operators of cable communications systems shall use existing poles and conduit. Additional poles may not be installed in the right-of-way, nor may pole capacity be increased by vertical or horizontal extenders, without the permission of the city. 

1. To minimize disruption of public passage or infrastructure, to forestall or relieve exhaustion of public rights-of-way capacity, or to protect environmentally sensitive areas, the city may require as a condition of issuing any public rights-of-way permit for erection of new poles or construction of underground conduit, the installation of which requires excavation of or along any traveled way, that the franchisee, licensee, or holder of the rights-of-way permit emplace pole space or empty conduits in excess of its own present and reasonably foreseeable requirements for the purpose of accommodating the city and/or other franchisees and licensees. 

G. Undergrounding.

1. Whenever all existing utilities are located underground in an area in the city, every cable communications system operator in the same area must locate its cable communications system underground 

2. Whenever the owner of a pole locates or relocates underground within an area of the city, every cable communications system operator in the same area shall concurrently relocate its facilities underground. 

3. The city of Fortuna city manager may, for good cause shown, exempt a particular system or facility or group of facilities from the obligation to locate or relocate facilities underground, where relocation is impractical, where ordinary engineering practices making undergrounding impractical, or where the city and the subscriber’s interest can be protected in another manner. Nothing in this section prevents the city from ordering communications facilities to be located or relocated underground under other provisions of the city code.

H. Prompt Repairs. Any and all public rights-of-way, other public property, or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation, maintenance or repair of a cable communications system shall be promptly repaired by the operator. Public property and public rights-of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the city and to a condition as good or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred. No tree trimming shall be performed without the permission of the city and other affected authorities, and any tree trimming must be performed in strict accordance with the city code.

I. Movement of Facilities for Government. 

1. A cable communications system operator shall, within a reasonable period of time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction and repair (including regrading, resurfacing or widening); public right-of-way vacation; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned system or utility, public work, public facility, or improvement; or for any other purpose where the work involved would be aided by the removal or relocation of the cable communications system. Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the “public work.”

2. The city shall provide written notice describing where the public work is to be performed as far in advance as reasonably possible but in any event at least one week prior to the deadline by which a cable communications system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or remove its facilities. Such action on the part of the franchisee shall be undertaken at no cost to the city. Provided that, in an emergency where a cable communications system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city need not provide one week’s written notice but should make an effort to contact the franchisee by telephone to enable the franchisee to take prompt action. After such effort on the part of the city to contact the franchisee by telephone, the city may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate any or all parts of the cable communications system without further notice, and charge the cable communications system operator for costs incurred.

J. Movement for Others.

1. To accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person authorized to use the public rights-of-way or public property, a franchisee shall, by a reasonable time specified by such person, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, temporarily relocate or temporarily remove its facilities. The franchisee must be given written notice describing where the construction, operation or repair is to be performed at least 15 days prior to the time by which its work must be completed. 

2. A cable communications system operator shall, on the request of any person holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires by a time specified to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. A cable communications system operator shall be given not less than seven days’ advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. The reasonable costs associated with of such temporary removal, relaying, relocation, or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid in advance by the person requesting the same.

K. Abandonment in Place. 

1. A cable communications system operator may abandon any property in place in the public rights-of-way upon written notice to the city. However, if, within 90 days of the receipt of written notice of abandonment, the city determines that the safety, appearance, functioning or use of the public right-of-way and facilities in the public right-of-way will be adversely affected, the property must be removed by a date specified by the city. 

2. A cable communications system operator that abandons its property must, upon request, transfer ownership of the properties to the city at no cost, and execute necessary quitclaim deeds and indemnify the city against future costs associated with mitigating or eliminating any environmental hazard associated with the abandoned property.

L. System Subject to Inspection. Every cable communications system facility shall be subject to inspection and testing by the city upon reasonable prior notice and conditions. Each operator must respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the system as the city may from time to time issue, including requests for information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated, or repaired. 

M. Underground Services Alert. Each operator of a cable communications system that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional notification center for subsurface installations (underground services alert) and shall field mark the locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The operator shall identify the location of its cable communication system for the city at no charge

N. Plan for Construction. Every franchise shall specify for the city a construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable communications system. The schedule shall provide for the prompt completion of the project, shall show its timetable for construction of each phase of the project, with benchmarks for deliverables and the areas of the city that will be affected. The city shall have the right to impose penalties on the operator for a failure to meet the accepted timetable and benchmarks. 

O. Use of Facilities by the City of Fortuna. The city shall have the right to install and maintain, free of charge upon any poles or in any conduit owned by a franchisee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable service operations of the franchisee. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.12)).


14.04.130 Protection of the city of Fortuna and residents.

A. Indemnity Required. No franchise shall be valid or effective until and unless the city obtains an adequate indemnity from the franchisee. The indemnity must:

1. Release the city from and against any and all loss, damage, expense, cost (without limitation, the cost of litigation), liability and responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable communications system. Each cable communications system operator must further agree not to sue or seek any money or damages from the city in connection with the above mentioned matters.

2. Indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the city, its elected and appointed officers, agents, and employees, from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, cost, claims, demands, or causes of action of any kind or nature, and the resulting losses, costs, expenses, reasonable attorneys’ fees, liabilities, damages, orders, judgments, or decrees sustained by the city or any third party arising out of, or by reason of, or resulting from or of the acts, errors, or omissions of the cable communications system operator, or its agents, independent contractors or employees related to or in any way arising out of the construction, operation or repair of the system.

3. Provide that the covenants and representations relating to the release, indemnification, and hold harmless provision shall survive the term of the franchise or other authorization and continue in full force and effect as to the party’s responsibility to indemnify.

B. Insurance Required. A franchisee (or those acting on its behalf) shall not commence construction or operation of the system without obtaining insurance in amounts and of a type reasonably satisfactory to the city. The required insurance must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the franchisee has facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the franchisee, its contractors, or subcontractors do not have the required insurance, the city may order such entities to stop operations until the insurance is obtained and approved. 

C. Proof.

For entities that have facilities in the public rights-of-way as of the effective date of this title, the certificate and endorsements shall be filed within 60 days of the effective date of this title, annually thereafter, and whenever there is any change in coverage, unless a pre-existing franchise provides for filing of certificates and/or endorsements in a different manner. In the event that the insurance certificate and/or endorsements provided indicates that the insurance shall terminate or lapse during the term of the franchise or license, then in that event, the cable communications system operator shall furnish, at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of such insurance, a renewed certificate of insurance and endorsement as proof that equal and like coverage has been or will be obtained prior to any such lapse or termination during the balance of the franchise or license under which the cable communications system operates.

D. Certificate Contents. All certificates and/or endorsements shall contain a provision that coverages afforded under these policies will not be canceled until at least 30 days’ prior written notice has been given to the city. Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business under the laws of the state of California. Financial ratings of the insurer shall be no less than “A” VII or better in the latest edition of “Bests Key Rating Guide,” published by A.M. Best Guide.

G. Security Fund. Every cable communications system operator shall establish and maintain a cash security fund or provide the city an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $100,000 to secure the payment of fees owed, to secure any other performance promised in a franchise, and to pay any taxes, fees, penalties or liens owed to the city. The letter of credit shall be in a form and with an institution acceptable to the city. Should the city draw upon the cash security fund or letter of credit, the cable communications system operator shall, within 14 days, restore the fund or the letter of credit to the full required amount. This security fund/letter of credit may be waived or reduced by the city for a franchisee where the city determines in its discretion that a particular franchisee’s operations are sufficiently limited that a security fund/letter of credit is not necessary to secure the required performance. The city may from time to time require a franchisee to change the amount of the required security fund/letter of credit to reflect changed risks to the city and to the public, including delinquencies in taxes or other payments to the city. The cash security fund or letter of credit must be obtained prior to the effective date of any franchise, license, transfer or franchise renewal, unless a franchise specifically provides otherwise. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.13)).


14.04.140 Enforcement and remedies.

A. Franchise Violation – Notice and Procedures. Before revoking a franchise or issuing an order to assess liquidated damages, the city shall follow the procedures set forth below:

1. The city shall notify a cable communications system operator in writing of any alleged violation (“violation notice”) of a franchise or the ordinance codified in this title. The violation notice shall: (a) identify the violation; (b) direct the cable communications system operator to cure the violation or show cause why the violation cannot or should not be cured; and (c) state the time for the cable communications system operator’s response, which shall be at minimum 30 days from the date of issuance of the violation notice, except for violations that present a danger to public health, safety or welfare, in which case the time for response may be shortened.

2. Within the time period designated for response, the cable communications system operator shall respond in writing to the city indicating that: (a) the cable communications system operator intends to contest the violation notice and describing all facts relevant to its claim; or (b) the cable communications system operator has completely cured the violation, in which case the cable communications system operator shall provide documentation demonstrating that the violation has been completely cured; or (c) the cable communications system operator has begun to correct the violation, however, the violation cannot be corrected immediately despite the cable communications system operator’s continued due diligence, in which case the operator shall describe in detail the steps already taken and the operator’s proposed plan and time schedule for completely curing the violation. Correction of the violation is not complete until all damages and penalties owed are paid in full.

3. If the cable communications system operator contests the violation notice or the city determines that the cable communications system operator has failed to completely cure the violation, to submit an acceptable plan to cure the violation, or to work diligently to cure the violation, the city shall schedule a hearing before the city council (“violation hearing”). The city shall provide the cable communications system operator written notice of the violation hearing at least 20 days prior to the hearing (“hearing notice”).

4. The hearing notice shall indicate: (a) the time and place of the violation hearing; (b) the nature of the violation; and (c) the cable communications system operator’s right to present oral and written testimony at an open and public meeting.

5. At the violation hearing, the board of supervisors shall hear and consider evidence from the cable communications system operator, city staff and members of the public regarding the alleged violation. The cable communications system operator shall be given an opportunity to present any and all evidence relating to the alleged violation. 

6. If, based upon the evidence presented at the violation hearing, the city council finds that the cable communications system operator has violated a franchise, the ordinance codified in this title, or any applicable state or federal law, the board of supervisors may issue an order assessing liquidated damages if provided for by the cable communications system operator’s franchise, or, subject to subsection (B) of this section and the terms of the cable communications system operator’s franchise, revoke or shorten the franchise.

B. Revocation and Termination. The city council may revoke a franchise or reduce the term of a franchise if it finds, after complying with procedures set forth above, that a cable communications system operator has violated this title or its franchise or license; has defrauded or attempted to defraud the city or subscriber; or has attempted to evade the requirements of this title or its franchise or license. Except as to violations that are impossible to cure, and as provided in subsections (C) and (D) of this section, the franchise may only be revoked if the franchisee (1) was given notice of the default; and (2) was given 30 days to cure the default; and (3) the franchisee failed to cure the default, or to propose a schedule for curing the default acceptable to the city where it is impossible to cure the default in 30 days. 

C. Exception for Certain Acts. No opportunity to cure is required for repeated violations, and fraud and attempted fraud shall be deemed incurable. Further, the city may declare a franchise forfeited without opportunity to cure where a franchisee (1) voluntarily stops providing service it is required to provide; or (2) transfers the franchise without the prior consent of the city. 

D. Exception for Bankruptcy. A franchise will terminate automatically by force of law 120 calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding. However, the franchise may be reinstated within that 120-day period, if: (1) such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or (2) such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this title and the franchise, and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this title and the franchise. In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the franchise following a public hearing before the city council by serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges thereunder will be revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless: (1) the city has approved the transfer of the franchise to the successful bidder; and (2) the successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise and this title.

E. Effect of Termination or Forfeiture. Upon termination or forfeiture of a franchise, whether by action of the city as provided above, or if a franchise expires and is not renewed, the franchisee must stop using the cable communications system for the purposes authorized by the franchise. The city may take possession of some or all of franchisee’s facilities, or require the franchisee or its bonding company to remove some or all of the franchisee’s facilities from the city’s property, and restore affected property to its same or better condition. This provision does not permit the city to remove facilities that are used to provide another service for which the franchisee holds a valid franchise issued by the city or if franchisee’s facilities are otherwise lawfully located on the city property pursuant to applicable local, state or federal law. 

F. Remedies Cumulative. Remedies provided for under this title or under a franchise shall be cumulative. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the security fund or letter of credit, does not limit a franchisee’s duty to indemnify the city; or relieve a franchisee of its franchise obligations or limit the amounts owed to the city. 

G. Liquidated Damages Required in Franchise. A franchise granted pursuant to this title shall require liquidated damages, in an amount to be specified in the franchise, for specified breaches of the franchise including, but not limited to, failure to commence construction, failure to meet construction plan benchmarks, failure to comply with rebuild plan benchmarks, failure to commence service, and material breach of franchise obligation(s). The franchise shall also provide that the city may withdraw liquidated damages owed from the grantee’s security deposit, after complying with the procedures set forth in subsection (A) of this section. Liquidated damages shall commence on that date that performance was due and/or failed, and continue until the grantee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the grantee has fully performed its obligations giving rise to the payment of liquidated damages. Any obligation to pay liquidated damages does not in any way affect the grantee’s obligation to pay franchise fees or perform other franchise obligations and such liquidated damages do not constitute franchise fees and are not subject to any limitations on franchise fees contained in 47 U.S.C. Section 542(b). Grantee acknowledges that any obligation to pay liquidated damages are not costs of satisfying franchise requirements as provided in 47 C.F.R. Section 76.925. Grantee agrees it will not pass the cost of any liquidated damages to subscribers through subscriber rates or itemize or otherwise identify on subscriber bills any obligation grantee may have to pay liquidated damages.

H. Penalties, Fines and Other Monetary Sanctions.

1. Penalties. In addition to any other remedies provided for in this title or otherwise available by law, the city shall have the power to impose monetary penalties in the event a grantee violates any provision of this title, a franchise, or any regulation lawfully adopted thereunder. The amounts of such penalties shall be specified in the franchise and shall be based on the following principles: 

a. Penalties shall exceed the financial benefits to a grantee delaying or failing to comply with the applicable requirement; 

b. Even where such benefits are not easily discernible, the penalties shall be high enough to have a significant deterrent effect on a grantee; and 

c. Penalties shall be sufficient to protect the city and other affected parties against loss of revenues resulting from violations.

2. Other Monetary Sanctions. A franchise shall also provide for fines, liquidated damages and other monetary sanctions, the amounts of which shall also reflect the foregoing principals.

3. Private Suit Against Grantee.

a. Any person or organization adversely affected by a violation, or by a pattern and practice of violations, shall have the right to sue a grantee in a court of competent jurisdiction for damages and for injunctive and other relief to require enforcement of the franchise. Organizations shall be entitled to sue on behalf of themselves or their members.

b. The remedy herein provided shall be in addition to any remedies provided by law.

c. Except in emergency situations in which immediate relief is required, private litigants shall notify the city attorney not fewer than 10 days prior to filing suit. However, suit by the city shall not preempt the private litigant’s right to proceed.

4. Except as otherwise provided herein, any person who violates any provisions of this title shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each offense; each day of said violation shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.14)).


14.04.150 Books and records.

A. Generally. Each cable communications system operator shall provide the city access to books and records related in whole or in part to the construction, operation, or repair of the cable communications system, or a group of systems of which the system is a part, so that the city may inspect and copy these books and records. The records include, but are not limited to revenue records, and other records related to compliance with any provision of this title or a franchise. A franchisee is responsible for obtaining or maintaining the necessary possession or control of all such books and records, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and records must be maintained for a period of five years, except that a franchise may specify a shorter period for certain categories of voluminous books and records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from other materials. The phrase “books and records” shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored. 

B. Production. Books and records requested shall be produced to the city by a time and at a location in the city designated by the city manager. However, if the requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied and moved, then the franchisee may request that the inspection take place at some other location mutually agreed to by the city and the franchisee, provided that (1) the franchisee must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the city after its review; and (2) the franchisee must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the city (above those that would have been incurred had the documents been produced in the city) in inspecting those documents or having those documents inspected by its designee. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.15)).


14.04.160 Reports. 

A. Obligation to Submit. The city manager may from time to time direct a franchisee to prepare reports and to submit those reports by a date certain, in a format prescribed by the city manager, in addition to those required by this title for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the ordinance codified in this title and the franchise.

B. Quarterly Reports. Unless an exemption is granted by the city manager, within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter, a franchisee shall submit a report to the city containing the following information:

1. The number of service calls (calls requiring a truck roll) received during the prior quarter and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber base; and

2. The total estimated hours of known outages as a percentage of total hours of operation. An outage is a loss of sound or video on any signal, or a significant deterioration of any signal affecting two or more subscribers.

C. Annual Reports. Unless an exemption is granted by the city manager, no later than 120 days after the end of its fiscal year a franchisee shall submit the following information:

1. A revenue report from the previous calendar year for the cable communications system, certified by an officer of the franchisee and a similarly certified statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding year and a detailed explanation of the method of computation showing (i) gross revenues by category (e.g., basic, pay, pay-per-view, advertising, installation, equipment, late charges, miscellaneous, other); and (ii) what, if any, deductions were made from gross revenues in calculating the franchise fee (e.g., bad debt, credits and refunds), and the amount of each deduction.

2. A report showing, for each applicable customer service standard, the franchisee’s performance with respect to that standard for each quarter of the preceding year. In each case where franchisee concludes it did not comply fully, the franchisee will describe the corrective actions it is taking to assure future compliance. In addition, the report should identify the number and nature of all the customer service complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions.

3. An ownership report, indicating all persons who at the time of filing control or own an interest in the franchisee of 10 percent or more. 

D. Contemporaneous Reports. Within 10 days of their receipt or (in the case of documents created by the operator or its affiliate) filing, a franchisee shall provide the city: 

1. Notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the operation of the system; and 

2. Any request for protection under bankruptcy laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the franchisee or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the franchisee directly or indirectly. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.16)).


14.04.170 Maps required.

Each franchisee shall maintain accurate maps and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general description of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way and any power supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon post-construction inspection to verify location. Each franchisee shall provide a map to the city showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be directed by the city public works director and update the map at least annually, and whenever the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided in hard copy and on disk, in a commercially available electronic format specified by the city public works director. Any disk provided to the city shall be returned to the franchisee after information contained therein is entered into the city’s electronic mapping or other similar such system. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.17)).


14.04.180 Other records required.

Unless the city manager waives the requirement, a franchisee shall at all times maintain:

A. Complaint Records. Records of all complaints received, their nature and resolution. The term “complaints” refers to complaints about any aspect of the franchisee’s operations or customer service.

B. Outage Records. Records of outages known to the franchisee, their cause and duration.

C. Complaint Response. Records of service calls for repair and maintenance indicating the date and time service was requested, the date of acknowledgment and date and time service was scheduled (if it was scheduled), and the date and time service was provided, and (if different) the date and time the problem was solved.

D. Installation Records. Records of installation/reconnection and requests for service extension, indicating date of request, date of acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended.

E. Customer Service. Records sufficient to show whether the franchisee has complied with each customer service standard that applies to it. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.18)).


14.04.190 Exemptions.

The city manager may temporarily exempt any franchisee from its obligations under FMC 14.04.150 through 14.04.180 if the manager determines that the requirement would be unduly burdensome or unnecessary, and that the city and subscriber interests may be adequately protected in some other manner. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.19)).


14.04.200 Privacy.

A franchisee shall take all reasonable steps required so that it is able to provide reports, books and records to the city, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy notices. Each franchisee shall be responsible for redacting data that applicable law prevents it from providing to the city. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a franchisee to violate state or federal subscriber privacy laws. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.20)).


14.04.210 Procedures for paying franchise fees and fees in lieu of franchise fees. 

A. Fees Paid Quarterly. The franchise fee paid pursuant to Chapter 14.08 FMC, or fee in lieu of franchise fee paid pursuant to Chapter 14.12 FMC shall be paid quarterly unless otherwise specified in a franchise. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the city not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. 

B. Quarterly Statement. Unless a franchise provides otherwise, a franchisee or other entity subject to a fee under Chapters 14.08 or 14.12 FMC shall file with the city within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter a statement showing gross revenues during the preceding quarter and the number of subscribers served.

C. Acceptance of Payment Not a Release. No acceptance by the city of Fortuna of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such payment be construed as a release of any claim the city may have for additional sums payable.

D. Fee Not in Lieu of Taxes. Neither the franchise fee under Chapter 14.08 FMC, nor the fee paid in lieu of the franchise fee under Chapter 14.12 FMC, is a payment in lieu of any tax, fee or other assessment of general applicability (including any such tax, fee or assessment imposed on both utilities and cable operators or their services, but not including a tax, fee, or assessment which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or cable subscriber(s).

E. Failure to Pay Franchise Fee. In the event that a fee payment is not received by the city on or before the due date set forth in this section or in a franchise, or the fee owed is not fully paid, the person subject to the fee will be charged interest from the due date at an interest rate equal to three percent above the rate for three-month Federal Treasury Bills at the most recent United States Treasury Department sale of such Treasury Bills occurring prior to the due date of the franchise fee payment. 

F. Final Statement of Gross Revenues. Within 90 days of the date a franchisee ceases operations under a franchise (whether because of franchise termination, transfer, bankruptcy or for any other reason), the franchisee shall file a final statement of gross revenues covering the period from the beginning of the calendar year in which the operations ceased to the date operations ceased. The statement shall contain the information and be certified as required by FMC 14.04.160(C)(1). (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (1.21)).

14.08.020 Application for an initial franchise or renewal franchise.

A. Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to an application for an initial franchise or a renewal franchise application that is not governed by 47 U.S.C. Section 546(a) through (h). 

B. Process. Any person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise by submitting an application therefor on that person’s own initiative, or in response to a request for proposals issued by the city. If the city receives an unsolicited application, it may choose to issue a request for additional proposals, and require the applicant to amend its proposal to respond thereto. The city shall promptly conduct such investigations as are necessary to act on an application. 

C. Consideration of Application. In determining whether to grant a franchise, the city may consider: 

1. The extent to which an applicant for renewal has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise; 

2. Whether an applicant’s quality of service under its existing franchise, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like has been reasonable in light of the needs of the community;

3. Where the applicant has not previously held a cable system franchise in the city, whether the applicant’s record in other communities indicates that it can be relied upon to provide high-quality service throughout any franchise term;

4. Whether the applicant has the financial, legal, and technical ability to provide the services, facilities, and equipment set forth in an application, and to satisfy any minimum requirements established by the city;

5. Whether the applicant’s application is reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the city, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;

6. Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on streets, public property, and private property that will be used by the applicant’s cable system; 

7. Whether issuance of the franchise would reduce competition in the provision of cable service in the city; 

8. Such other matters as the city is authorized or required to consider.

D. Issuance of Franchise. If the city determines that issuance of a franchise would be in the public interest considering the factors described above, it may offer a franchise agreement to the applicant. No franchise shall become effective until the franchise is unconditionally accepted by the applicant, approved by the Fortuna city council, and the franchise agreement is signed by both parties.

The city shall thereafter commence any proceedings that may be required under federal law, and upon completion of those proceedings, the city may issue a request for proposals and an application may be submitted for renewal. The city may preliminarily deny the application by resolution, and if the application is preliminarily denied, the city may conduct such proceedings and by resolution establish such procedures and appoint such individuals as may be necessary to conduct any proceedings to review the application.

14.08.040 Application for transfer.

A. Scope. This section establishes additional provisions that apply to applications for transfer approval. 

B. Information. An application for transfer must contain all the information required by the city manager, by FMC 14.08.010, and all information required by any FCC transfer form. 

C. Consideration of Application. In determining whether a transfer application should be granted, denied, or granted subject to conditions, the city may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the city, whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would otherwise adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the city’s interest under this title, the franchise, or other applicable law. The proposed transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and evaluating the applications.

D. Minimum Conditions. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an applicant must show, at a minimum, that: the transferee is qualified; the transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public, or the city; and that non-compliance issues have been resolved. No application shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this title and the franchise, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee for all purposes. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.4)).

3. The applicant must not have had an application to the city for an initial or renewal cable system franchise denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application; and must not have had an application for an initial or renewal OVS franchise denied on any ground within three years of the application.

4. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anticompetitive actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers, or to substantially comply with its obligations.

5. The applicant must have the necessary authority under California and federal law to operate a cable system, or show that it is in a position to obtain that authority.

6. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.

7. For the purposes of subsections (A)(2) through (4) of this section, the term applicant includes any affiliate of applicant. 

B. Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, an applicant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should be issued even if the requirements of subsections (A)(3) and (4) of this section are not satisfied, by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.5)).


14.08.060 Franchise fee.

A cable operator shall pay to the city a franchise fee in an amount equal to five percent of gross revenues, or such other amount as may be specified in the franchise; provided, however, that if the franchise specifies an amount, that amount shall be subject to increase should federal limits on fee payments be eliminated or changed and other cable operators are subject to a higher fee.

A. “Bundled services.” In the event that the franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, offer bundled, tied, or combined cable services (which are subject to the franchise fee) with non-cable services (which may not be subject to the franchise fee) to individual subscribers, the combined revenues from such bundled services shall be allocated consistent with the rates or prices advertised by the franchisee through its marketing materials or on its published rate card. In the event the franchisee does not advertise or publish separate prices for the combined services, the percentage that the price for the combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of the individual services shall be pro-rated across all the services in the bundled package; provided, however, that the net revenues derived from services subject to mandatory tariff rates imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (or other governmental entity having such authority) shall be deducted from the combined revenue to determine the revenue subject to the franchise fee. As an example, the franchisee may offer a “bundle” of video, voice and data services for a flat fee of $75.00 where the retail rate for the services purchased on an individual basis would equal $100.00. Assuming that there is no service subject to the mandated tariff rate, grantee would apply a 25 percent discount to each service. Thus, if the retail rate for the cable service in the bundle were $50.00, the grantee would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of $37.50 and pay a franchise fee on that revenue.

B. The definition of “gross revenue” is to be as inclusive as possible consistent with existing applicable law. If a change in federal law occurs subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, such change shall not impact the gross revenues definition in such a way to reduce gross revenues, unless the change specifically preempts the affected portion of the definition above. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.6)).


14.08.070 No exclusivity.

A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing service. However, nothing herein prevents a franchisee from entering into an otherwise lawful, mutually desired exclusive arrangement with a building owner or manager of a multiple dwelling unit or commercial subscriber. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.7)).


14.08.080 Minimum franchise conditions.

In addition to satisfying such additional or stricter conditions as the city finds necessary based on its investigations, the following elements shall be required in every franchise serving more than 1,000 subscribers; an operator who provides service in an area which is defined as “isolated rural” may be exempted from the minimum franchise requirements for that area. 

A. System Design. Each franchisee shall provide a cable system which uses at least 750 MHz equipment of high quality and reliability. Each franchisee shall install and activate the return portion of the cable system in the sub-low frequency spectrum of five MHz to 30 MHz.

B. Public, Educational and Government Use of the System. 

1. A franchisee shall provide a minimum of three channels for PEG access to each subscriber.

2. Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace as necessary, a dedicated, bi-directional fiber optic link between its headend and a location designated by the city as the primary access center. 

3. Each franchisee shall install, maintain, and replace activated two-way cable plant and all headend, cable plant, and node equipment required to make it operable so that the city, schools, and all designated PEG access centers and access facilities located within the franchise area will be able to send and receive signals (video, audio, and data) using the activated two-way cable plant. 

4. Each franchisee shall ensure that technically adequate signal quality, routing systems, and switching and/or processing equipment are initially and continuously provided for all access interconnections both within franchisee’s cable system and with other cable systems throughout the duration of its franchise.

5. In the event a franchisee makes any change in the cable system and related equipment and facilities or in the franchisee’s signal delivery technology which, directly or indirectly, substantially affects the signal quality or transmission of access programming, the franchisee shall at its expense take necessary steps or provide necessary technical assistance, including the acquisition of all necessary equipment, to ensure that the capabilities of access programmers are not diminished or adversely affected by such change.

6. A franchisee shall maintain all access channels (both upstream channels and downstream channels) and all interconnections of access channels at the same level of technical quality and reliability as the best commercial channels carried on the grantee’s system. 

C. Service to Franchise Area. It is the policy of the city to ensure that every cable system provide service in its franchise area upon request to any person or any government building. Each franchisee shall extend service upon request within its franchise area; provided, that a franchise may permit a franchisee to require a potential subscriber to contribute a fair share of the capital costs of installation or extension as a condition of extension or installation in cases where such extension or installation may be unduly expensive. Service must be provided within time limits specified in subsection (D) of this section.

D. Time for Extension. Except as a franchise otherwise provides, service must be extended upon request to any person or to any government building in a franchisee’s franchise area (1) within seven days of the request, where service can be provided by activating or installing a drop; (2) within 90 days of the request where an extension of one-half mile or less is required; or (3) within six months where an extension of one-half mile or more is required. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchisee shall not be deemed to be in violation of this section in the event the franchisee uses reasonable efforts to complete the extension in a timely manner but weather or other circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee prevent such timely completion. 

E. Technical Standards. A cable system within the city shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 76.601 and any other applicable technical standards. 

F. Testing. Each cable operator shall perform at its expense such tests as may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in compliance with its obligations under applicable FCC standards, this title or a franchise.

G. Interconnection. Upon request of the city, every cable system shall be required to interconnect with every other cable system within the city, or adjacent to the city, on fair and reasonable terms for purposes of providing PEG and I-Net services.

H. Continuity of Service. Each franchisee shall, during the term of the franchise, ensure that subscribers are able to receive continuous service. In the event the franchise is revoked or terminated, the franchisee may be required to continue to provide service for a reasonable period to assure an orderly transition of service from the franchisee to another entity. A franchise may establish more particular requirements under which these obligations will be satisfied. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.8)).


14.08.090 Rate regulation and consumer protection.

A. All Rates Subject to Regulation. The city may regulate any of the cable operator’s rates and charges, except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by law. The city will regulate rates in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, where applicable. Except to the extent FCC rules provide otherwise, all rates and charges that are subject to regulation, and changes in those rates or charges must be approved in advance. The city manager may take any required steps to file complaints, toll rates, issue accounting orders or take any other steps required to comply with FCC regulations. The city council shall be responsible for issuing rate orders that establish rates or order refunds.

B. No Rate Discrimination. Except to the extent the city may not enforce such a requirement, a cable operator is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided, however, that a franchisee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the franchise area; and a franchisee may offer discounts for the elderly, the disabled, or the economically disadvantaged and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. 

C. Redlining Prohibited. A cable operator shall not deny access or charge different rates to any group of subscribers or potential subscribers because of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.

D. Customer Service. 

1. Each cable operator must satisfy FCC, state and the city cable customer service standards (see Appendix A) or consumer protection standards. The city cable customer service standards may be adopted by resolution. In the case of a conflict among standards, the stricter standard shall apply.

2. For violation of cable customer service standards, penalties will be imposed as follows:

a. Two hundred dollars for each day of each material breach, not to exceed $600.00 for each occurrence of the material breach.

b. If there is a subsequent material breach of the same provision within 12 months, $400.00 for each day of each material breach, not to exceed $1,200 for each occurrence of the material breach.

c. If there is a third or additional material breach of the same provision within 12 months of the first, $1,000 for each day of each material breach, not to exceed $3,000 for each occurrence of the material breach. 

3. Any penalty assessed under this section will be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent any liquidated damage provision of a franchise imposes a monetary obligation on a franchisee for the same customer service failures, and no other monetary damages may be assessed. The city will provide notice, and impose penalties, under this section pursuant to the procedures established by California Government Code Section 53088.2(r). (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (2.9)).

14.12.020 Applications for grant or renewal of franchises.

A. Initial and Renewal Franchise Application. 

1. A written application shall be filed with the city for grant of an initial or renewal franchise.

2. To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with six copies. The application must conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain all information required under subsection (B) of this section. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the applicant with respect to the application.

B. Contents of Applications. The city manager may specify the information that must be provided in connection with a request for proposals or an application for an initial or renewal franchise (see Appendix B). At a minimum, each application must: identify the applicant, where it plans to construct its system, and the system construction schedule; show that the applicant will provide adequate channels, facilities and other support for public, educational and government use (including institutional network use) of the OVS; and show that the applicant is financially, technically and legally qualified to construct and operate the OVS. The application must contain the following information: 

1. Identity of the applicant; the persons who exercise working control over the applicant; and the persons who control those persons, to the ultimate parent.

2. A proposal for construction of the open video system that includes at least the following:

a. A description of the services that are to be provided over the facility. 

b. Identification of the area of the city to be served by the proposed system, including a description of the proposed franchise area’s boundaries.

c. The location of the proposed facility and facility design, including a description of the miles of plant to be installed, and a description of the size of equipment cabinets, shielding and electronics that will be installed along the plant route, the power sources that will be used and a description of the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that will be generated by the operation of the same. 

d. A map of the route the facility will follow; a designation of the portions of the system that will be placed above ground and the portions that will be placed underground, and the construction techniques that the operator proposes to use in installing the system above ground and underground; a schedule for construction of the facility, describing when and where construction will begin, how it will proceed, benchmarks for completion of phases, and when it will be completed; and the expected effect on right-of-way usage, including information on the ability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system, including, as appropriate given the system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities.

e. A description, where appropriate, of how services will be converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done with existing facilities.

3. Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant has the financial resources to complete the proposed project, and to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility over the franchise term. It is not the intent of the city to require an applicant to prove that the services it proposed to offer will succeed in the marketplace.

4. Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant is technically qualified to construct, operate and repair the proposed facility. At a minimum, the applicant must show that it has experience or resources to ensure that work is to be performed adequately, and can respond to emergencies during and after construction is complete.

5. Evidence satisfactory to the city that the applicant is legally qualified, which proof must include a demonstration that the applicant:

a. Has received, or is in a position to receive, necessary authorizations from state and federal authorities;

b. Has not engaged in conduct (fraud, racketeering, violation of antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, or similar laws) that allows city to conclude the applicant cannot be relied upon to comply with requirements of franchise, or provisions of this title;

c. Is willing to enter into a franchise, to pay required compensation and to abide by the provisions of applicable law, including those relating to the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities, and has not entered into any agreement that would prevent it from doing so;

6. An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of applicable law.

7. An applicant may show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the acts or omissions at issue; the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and to prevent their recurrence; and the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the acts or omissions from the operation of open video system facilities.

8. To the extent that the applicant is in any respect relying on the financial or technical resources of another person, including another affiliate, the proofs should be provided for that person. An applicant will be presumed to have the requisite financial, or technical or legal qualifications to the extent such qualifications have been reviewed and approved by a state agency of competent jurisdiction; or if the applicant is a holder of a franchise in the city for a cable system or open video system, and conduct under such other franchise provides no basis for additional investigation.

C. Procedure for Applying for Grant of a Franchise. 

1. A person may apply for an initial or renewal franchise on its own initiative or in response to a request for proposals. Upon receipt of an application the city shall promptly proffer the applicant a proposed OVS agreement, which shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available to any other interested party. The city may request such additional information as it deems appropriate. 

2. An applicant shall respond to requests for information completely, and within the time directed by the city, and must strictly comply with procedures, instructions, and requirements the city may establish. 

3. An application may be rejected if it is incomplete or the applicant fails to follow procedures or respond fully to information requests. 

D. Evaluation. In evaluating a franchise application, the city may consider the following:

1. The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing city OVS franchise;

2. Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to hold an OVS franchise;

3. Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city for, or will otherwise provide adequate public, educational, and governmental use capacity, facilities, or financial support (including with respect to institutional networks);

4. Whether issuance of a franchise would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; 

5. Whether the approval of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.

E. Issuance. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors above, and such other matters as it is required or entitled to consider, and subject to the applicant’s entry into an appropriate OVS agreement, it shall issue a franchise. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received.

F. Legal Qualifications. In order to be legally qualified:

1. The applicant must be willing to comply with the provisions of this title and applicable laws, and to comply with such requirements of an OVS agreement as the city may lawfully require.

2. The applicant must not hold a cable system franchise, or have pending an application for a cable system franchise.

3. The applicant must not have had any cable system or OVS franchise validly revoked (including any appeals) by the city within three years preceding the submission of the application. 

4. The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or renewal cable system franchise to the city denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a cable system meeting the cable-related needs and interests of the community, or as to which any challenges to such franchising decision were finally resolved (including any appeals) adversely to the applicant, within three years preceding the submission of the application.

5. The applicant may not have had an application for an initial or renewal OVS franchise denied on any grounds within three years of the application.

6. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if, at any time during the 10 years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of fraud, racketeering, anticompetitive actions, unfair trade practices or other conduct of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers or to substantially comply with its obligations.

7. The applicant must have the necessary authority under California and federal law to operate an OVS, and must be certified by the FCC under Section 653 of the Cable Act.

8. The applicant shall not be issued a franchise if it files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide.

9. For purposes of subsections (F)(2) through (5) of this section, the term “applicant” includes any affiliate of applicant. 

G. Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (F) of this section, an applicant shall be provided a reasonable opportunity to show that a franchise should be issued even if the requirements of subsections (F)(4) and (5) of this section are not satisfied, by virtue of the circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant’s principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of a cable system. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.2)).


14.12.030 Transfers.

A. City of Fortuna Approval Required. No transfer shall occur without prior written notice to and approval of the city. 

B. Application.

1. A franchisee shall promptly notify the city of any proposed transfer, and submit an application for its approval. 

2. The city manager may specify information that must be provided in connection with a transfer application. At a minimum, an application must: describe the entities involved in the transaction and the entity that will hold the franchise; describe the chain of ownership before and after the proposed transaction; show that the entity that will hold the franchise will be legally, financially, and technically qualified to do so; attach complete information on the proposed transaction, including the contracts or other documents that relate to the proposed transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to therein; and attach any shareholder reports or filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that discuss the transaction.

3. For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary to determine whether the transfer is in the public interest and should be approved, denied, or conditioned. If the transferee or franchisee refuse to provide information, or provide incomplete information, the request for transfer may be denied. 

C. Determination by the City.

1. In deciding whether a transfer application should be granted, denied or granted subject to conditions, the city may consider the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the OVS; whether the incumbent OVS operator is in compliance with its OVS agreement and this title and, if not, the proposed transferee’s commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other OVS or cable system in the city, and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; and whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers, the public, or the city’s interest under this title, the OVS agreement, or other applicable law.

2. In order to obtain approval of a transfer, an applicant must show, at a minimum, that: the transferee is qualified; the transfer will not adversely affect the interests of subscribers, the public, or the city; and that noncompliance issues have been resolved. No application shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this title and the franchise, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and unknown, of the previous franchisee for all purposes. The proposed transferee shall pay all reasonable costs incurred by the city in reviewing and evaluating the applications. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.3)).


14.12.040 Minimum requirements. 

A. PEG Access. No OVS operator shall be issued a franchise, or may commence construction of an OVS system, until (1) it agrees to match in all respects the highest PEG obligations borne by any cable operator in the city; or (2) it agrees to PEG obligations acceptable to the city. 

B. Institutional Network. Any OVS operator that constructs an I-Net must match in all respects the highest I-Net obligations borne by any cable operator in the city, unless it agrees to alternative I-Net obligations acceptable to the city. 

C. Construction Provisions. Every OVS agreement shall specify the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuilding of the OVS. The schedule shall provide for prompt completion of the project, considering the amount and type of construction required.

D. Testing. Each OVS operator shall perform at its expense such tests as may be necessary to show whether or not the franchisee is in compliance with its obligations under this title or a franchise.

E. Consumer Protection Provisions. Every franchisee must satisfy customer service consumer protection requirements established from time to time under state or local law and applicable to OVS. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.4)).


14.12.050 Special termination rules.

If a franchisee’s FCC certification is revoked or otherwise terminates as a result of the passage of time or as a matter of law, the city may revoke the OVS franchise after a hearing. The OVS franchise may also be revoked if federal regulations or statutory provisions governing OVS are declared invalid or unenforceable, or are repealed. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.5)).


14.12.060 Rate regulation.

The city may regulate a franchisee’s rates and charges except as prohibited by law, and may do so by amendment to this title, separate ordinance, by amendment to an OVS agreement, or in any other lawful manner. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.6)).


14.12.070 Fee in lieu of franchise fee.

A. OVS Operators. In lieu of the franchise fee required by Chapter 14.08 FMC, an OVS franchisee shall pay a fee of five percent of the gross revenues of the franchisee, its affiliates or any OVS operator of the OVS.

B. Persons Leasing OVS Capacity. 

1. A person leasing capacity from an OVS operator, other than a person whose revenues are included in the payment made under subsection (A) of this section shall pay the city a fee, in lieu of the franchise fee required by Chapter 14.08 FMC, of five percent of the gross revenues of such person.

2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where franchisee charges a person, other than an affiliate, to use its OVS (the “use payments”); and that person recovers those use payments through charges to its subscribers that are included in that person’s gross revenues; and that person fully recovers the use payments through the charges to its subscribers and pays a fee on those charges pursuant to subsection (A) of this section, then the franchisee may deduct from its gross revenues the use payments it receives from that person. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.7)).


14.12.080 Exclusive contracts.

A franchisee may not require a subscriber or a building owner or manager to enter into an exclusive contract as a condition of providing or continuing service, nor may a franchisee enter into any arrangement that would effectively prevent other persons from using the OVS to compete in the delivery of cable services with a franchisee or its affiliates. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (3.8)).

(Ord. 04-646 § 1 (4.4)).


14.16.050 Discrimination prohibited. 

A. No Retaliatory Actions. A cable communications system operator shall not discriminate among persons or the city or take any retaliatory action against a person or the city because of that entity’s exercise of any right it may have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the operator require a person or the city to waive such rights as a condition of taking service.

B. Employment and Hiring Practices.

(Ord. 04-646 § 1 (4.5)).


14.16.060 Confidential information.

A. Access to a cable communication system operator’s records shall not be denied to the city on the basis that said records contain proprietary information.

Subject to applicable law, including the California Public Records Act, California Government Code Section 6250 et seq., the city shall keep any information which is marked “proprietary” or “confidential” (and, under applicable law, deemed “proprietary” or “confidential”) submitted by franchisee or licensee as required under this title or by a franchise or license (“information”) in confidence, as contemplated by California Government Code Section 6254.15. In the event that the city believes requested information must be disclosed, the city shall not disclose the information or any part thereof to any third party, government agency or regulatory body seeking to inspect or obtain the information under a California Public Records Act request without first informing cable communication system operator of such request and affording the cable communication system operator the opportunity to resist such disclosure at its sole cost and expense. The city shall not be liable to cable communication system operator for any submission or disclosure of such information to a third party as required by applicable law or to a government agency or regulatory body seeking the information and claiming jurisdiction in any of these events. Nothing in this section shall limit the right of the cable communication system operator to contest disclosure or submission to a third party as required by law, or to a government agency or regulatory body asserting jurisdiction over it or such subject matter, before such disclosure shall be effected. (Ord. 04-646 § 1 (4.6)).


14.16.070 Transitional provisions.

14.18.005 General provisions.

A. Purpose. This section is applicable to video service providers who have been awarded a state video franchise under the California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq. (the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 [“DIVCA”]) to provide cable or video services in any location(s) within the incorporated boundaries of the city. It is the purpose of this section to implement within the incorporated boundaries of the city the provisions of DIVCA and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated thereunder that are applicable to a “local franchising entity” or a “local entity” as defined in DIVCA.

B. Rights Reserved. 

1. The rights reserved to the city under this chapter are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this title or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other rights which may be held by the city.

2. Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a state franchise shall not include, or be a substitute for: 

a. Compliance with applicable requirements for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the city, including, but not limited to, compliance with the conditions that the city may establish before facilities may be constructed for, or providing, nonvideo services; 

b. Any permit or authorization required in connection with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, street work permits, pole attachment permits and street cut permits; and

c. Any permit, agreement or authorization for occupying any other property of the city or any private person to which access is not specifically granted by the state franchise. 

3. No permit issued by the city to a state franchise holder is itself a franchise, nor shall any permit create a vested right that would prohibit the city from revoking or amending the permit. 

C. Compliance with City Ordinances. Nothing contained in FMC 14.18.005 through 14.18.060 shall be construed so as to exempt a state franchise holder from compliance with all ordinances, rules or regulations of the city now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with FMC 14.18.005 through 14.18.060 or California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq., or any obligations under any franchise issued by the city insofar as those obligations may be enforced under California Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq.

D. Compliance with DIVCA. When a video service provider holding a state franchise provides notice to the city pursuant to 5840(m) of DIVCA that it is commencing to provide video service to the city, a holder of a local franchise is entitled to seek a state franchise pursuant to 5930(c) and upon issuance of a state franchise by the California Public Utilities Commission for the franchise area the local franchise shall terminate. (Ord. 10-687 § 1).

B. Permits. Prior to commencing any work for which a permit is required by this title, a state franchise holder shall apply for and obtain a permit in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 12.08 FMC and shall comply with all other applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to all applicable requirements of Division 13 of the California Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq.

F. In rendering its decision on the appeal, the city council shall not hear or consider any argument or evidence of any kind other than the record of the matter received from the city manager unless the city council is itself conducting a public hearing on the matter.

G. The issuance of a permit is not a franchise, and does not grant any vested rights in any location in the public rights-of-way, or in any particular manner of placement within the rights-of-way. Without limitation, a permit to place cabinets and similar appurtenances aboveground may be revoked and the permittee required to place facilities underground, in accordance with applicable law. (Ord. 10-687 § 1).


14.18.040 Emergency alert system.

Each state franchise holder shall comply with the emergency alert system requirements of the Federal Communications Commission in order that emergency messages may be distributed over the state franchise holder’s network. As such capability was required under local franchises in effect in the city on January 1 to December 30, 2006, and as consistent with Public Utilities Code Section 5880, each state franchise holder shall install and maintain equipment to allow the Humboldt County emergency management office to air audio and video messages on the video system to alert subscribers to emergency situations. This capability shall be remotely activated without the assistance of the state franchise holder and shall allow a representative of the city to override the audio and video on all channels, except those where grantee has, consistent with FCC regulations, agreed with the broadcaster not to override the channel for EAS messages. (Ord. 10-687 § 1).


14.18.050 Public, educational, and government access channel capacity, support, interconnection, and signal carriage.

A. PEG Channel Capacity. 

1. A state franchise holder shall designate a sufficient amount of capacity on its network to allow the provision of four PEG channels to satisfy the requirement of Section 5870 of the California Public Utilities Code, within the time limits specified therein. 

2. A state franchise holder shall provide an additional PEG channel when the city satisfies the standards set forth in Section 5870(d) of the California Public Utilities Code or any entity designated by the city to manage one or more of the PEG channels. 

B. PEG Support. 

1. Amount of PEG Support Fee. Any state franchise holder shall pay to the city – or, if directed by the city, to the city’s designated PEG provider – a PEG fee equal to 1.401 percent of gross revenues, an amount equivalent to the level of PEG funding remitted by the incumbent cable operator to the city’s designated PEG provider during the period of January 1, 2006, to December 30, 2006.

2. The PEG support fee shall be used for PEG activities, in a manner that is consistent with the terms of the incumbent cable operator’s franchise during the period of January 1, 2006, to December 30, 2006, and settlements.

3. A state franchise holder shall remit the PEG support fee quarterly, within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Each payment made shall be accompanied by a summary, detailing how the PEG support fee was calculated.

4. In the event that a state franchise holder fails to pay the PEG support fee when due, or underpays the proper amount due, the state franchise holder shall pay interest at the rate per year equal to the highest prime lending rate during the period of delinquency, plus one percent, or the maximum rate specified by state law. 

C. PEG Carriage and Interconnection. 

1. As set forth in Sections 5870(b) and 5870(g)(3) of the California Public Utilities Code, state franchise holders shall ensure that all PEG channels are receivable by all subscribers, whether they receive digital or analog service, or a combination thereof, without the need for any equipment other than that needed to receive the lowest cost tier of service. PEG access capacity provided by a state franchise holder shall be of similar quality and functionality to that offered by commercial channels (unless the PEG signal is provided to the state franchise holder at a lower quality or with less functionality), shall be capable of carrying a National Television System Committee (NTSC) television signal, and shall be carried on the state franchise holder’s lowest cost tier of service. To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law. After the initial designation of the PEG channel numbers, the channel numbers shall not be changed without the agreement of the city unless federal law requires the change. 

2. Where technically feasible, each state franchise holder and each incumbent cable operator shall negotiate in good faith to interconnect their networks for the purpose of providing PEG programming. Interconnection may be accomplished by any means authorized under Public Utilities Code Section 5870(h). Each state franchise holder and incumbent cable operator shall provide interconnection of PEG channels on reasonable terms and conditions and may not withhold the interconnection. If a state franchise holder and an incumbent cable operator cannot reach a mutually acceptable interconnection agreement for PEG carriage, the city may require the incumbent cable operator to allow each state franchise holder to interconnect its network with the incumbent cable operator’s network at a technically feasible point on the state franchise holder’s network as identified by the state franchise holder. If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, each state franchise holder shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the city and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by each state franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. (Ord. 2015-718 § 2; Ord. 10-687 § 1).


14.18.060 Notices.

A. Each state franchise holder or applicant for a state franchise shall file with the city a copy of all applications or notices that the state franchise holder or applicant is required to file with the California Public Utilities Commission.

B. Unless otherwise specified in this section, all notices or other documentation that a state franchise holder is required to provide to the city under this section or the California Public Utilities Code shall be provided to both the city manager and the city staff person in charge of cable and telecommunications, or their successors or designees. (Ord. 10-687 § 1).

15.44.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death and injury resulting from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry buildings constructed prior to the adoption and enforcement of building codes requiring earthquake resistant design. Such buildings are widely recognized for sustaining life-hazardous damage, including partial or complete collapse during moderate to strong earthquakes.

The provisions of this chapter are intended as minimum standards for structural seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of injury and loss of life. Compliance with these standards will not necessarily entirely prevent injury or loss of life or prevent earthquake damage to rehabilitated buildings. This chapter does not require alteration of existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.

This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of hazards in unreinforced masonry buildings based on their present use and condition. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and strengthened or demolished. (Ord. 89-539).


15.44.020 Scope.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all buildings constructed or under construction prior to the adoption and enforcement of earthquake resistant code requirements, or for which a building permit was issued prior to January 1, 1940, which have unreinforced masonry walls, foundations, piers or other structural elements.

Exception: This section shall not apply to any solely residential building containing five or fewer dwelling units; to structures used solely as warehouses or similar purposes not for human habitation; or to buildings owned by the state or federal governments.

Structures which come within the scope of this chapter, not identified and included in the original survey report made as a part of SB 547 implementation, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. For these buildings, applicable time limits in accordance with FMC 15.44.100 through 15.44.150 shall begin on the date of notification of the owner by the building division. (Ord. 89-539).

15.44.150 Time limit hardship extension.

For high hazard buildings, where a significant financial hardship can be shown to be caused by the time limits specified in FMC 15.44.110, the property owner may appeal to the city council for a one-year extension. Not more than three one-year extensions shall be approved on each building, i.e., the owner of a high hazard building, after obtaining the maximum number of discretionary extensions, as set forth above, may be allowed a maximum of eight years to obtain permits and complete seismic alterations. A separate appeal is required for each such extension.

To ensure consistent interpretation, the council shall publish minimum financial data submittal requirements and guidelines for review and approval of such appeals prior to consideration of any such appeal.

Hardship appeals shall be submitted prior to the expiration of the time limit being appealed. No extensions shall be provided for medium hazard and low hazard buildings. Failure to comply with requirements within an extended time limit shall be deemed failure to comply with the applicable time limit as extended. (Ord. 89-539).

15.50.010 Statutory authorization.

The Legislature of the state of California has in Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 of the Government Code conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of Fortuna does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 99-618 § 3).


15.50.020 Findings of fact.

A. The flood hazard areas of Fortuna are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.

B. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. 99-618 § 3; Ord. 87-509 § 2).


15.50.030 Statement of purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:

A. Protect human life and health;

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines, and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage;

G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 99-618 § 3; Ord. 87-509 § 2).


15.50.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.

In order to accomplish its purposes, this division includes methods and provisions to:

A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;

D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. 99-618 § 3).

Located within areas of special flood hazard established in FMC 15.54.020 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply.

A. Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

B. If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 99-618 § 3; Ord. 87-509 § 2).


Chapter 15.60 VARIANCE PROCEDURE

Sections:

15.60.010    Nature of variances.

15.60.020    Appeal board.

15.60.030    Conditions for variances.


15.60.010 Nature of variances.

The variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this division would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.

It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this division are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. 99-618 § 3).


15.60.020 Appeal board.

A. In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this division, and:

1. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

2. The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

5. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

6. The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

8. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

9. The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

10. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and

11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.

B. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice with the signature of a community official that:

1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage, and

2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Humboldt County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.

C. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 99-618 § 3).


15.60.030 Conditions for variances.

A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level; providing, that the procedures of Chapters 15.56 and 15.58 FMC have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” (as defined in Chapter 15.52 FMC) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the “minimum necessary” considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. “Minimum necessary” means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this division. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance.

E. Variances shall only be issued upon:

1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional “hardship” (as defined in Chapter 15.52 FMC) to the applicant; and

3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Chapter 15.52 FMC, see “Public safety and nuisance”), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Chapter 15.52 FMC) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

F. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections (A) through (E) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance.

G. Upon consideration of the factors of FMC 15.60.020(A) and the purposes of this division, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this division. (Ord. 99-618 § 3; Ord. 87-509 § 2).

(Ord. 79-426 § 11.01).


16.36.011 Drainage and sewer facilities.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a program to reduce flooding within the city by completing drainage improvements included in the 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan and sewer facilities needed to accommodate new development projects.

B. Construction of Off-Site Drainage Improvements. Storm drainage improvements shall be constructed in conformance with the city’s 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan and Improvements Standards and Specifications under the following circumstances:

1. Significant Impact. Storm drainage improvements shall be constructed prior to the filing of any parcel map or final map whenever a development project will either create a significant drainage impact or significantly impact an area with inadequate drainage facilities. The existing flooding problem (if any), the potential to impact existing development, the increase in stormwater runoff from the development project and the status of completing the drainage improvements in the 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan in the area impacted by the development project shall be considered in determining whether a development project will cause a significant impact.

A dollar-for-dollar credit for drainage fees shall be given whenever drainage improvements required by this section are included in the city’s 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan.

2. Conflict with 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan. Drainage improvements that are identified in the 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan shall be installed whenever a development project would conflict with such improvements.

A dollar-for-dollar credit for drainage fees shall be given for any drainage projects required by this section. The city shall also enter into a payback agreement when requested.

3. Drainage Fee Credit. In no event shall the amount of any credit exceed the drainage fee.

C. Drainage Fees.

1. Payment of Fees. Drainage fees shall be collected prior to the filing of any parcel map or final map. The city council shall set the method of payment, method of collection, and fee by resolution, and may, from time to time, amend the resolution.

2. Use of Fees. Fees collected shall be deposited in the “drainage facility fee fund” and such fees shall be used to construct storm drainage improvements included in the city’s 1982 Storm Drainage Master Plan.

Any interest earned by moneys deposited in the “drainage facility fee fund” shall be placed in such fund.

D. Sewer Facilities. Any subdivider shall construct sanitary sewer trunk lines and provide sanitary facilities as necessary to connect to the existing system without causing any manner of overloading. If capacity presently exists and a subdivider meets all requirements, an in-lieu fee may be paid which will provide for planned future expansion. The conditions for in-lieu fee qualification and the amount of any planned local facilities fee shall be established by resolution. (Ord. 89-538 § 3; Ord. 88-528 § 4; Ord. 87-507 § 4).


16.36.020 Bridge crossings and major thoroughfares.

The purpose of this section is to make provisions for assessing and collecting fees as a condition of approval of a final map or as a condition of issuing a building permit for the purpose of defraying the actual or estimated costs of constructing bridges or major thoroughfares pursuant to Section 66484 of the Government Code. (Ord. 79-426 § 11.02, 1979).


16.36.030 Supplemental improvements – Procedure.

The subdivider may be required to install improvements for the benefit of the subdivision which may contain supplemental size, capacity or number for the benefit of property not within the subdivision as a condition prior to the approval of a subdivision or parcel map, and thereafter to dedicate such improvements to the public. However, the subdivider shall be reimbursed for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements pursuant to Section 66485 et seq., of the Government Code. (Ord. 79-426 § 11.03).


16.36.040 Supplemental improvements – Drainage, sewerage, bridges and major thoroughfares.

If the city has adopted a local drainage or sanitary sewer plan or map as required for the imposition of fees therefor, or has established an area of benefit for bridges or major thoroughfares as provided in this chapter, the city may impose a reasonable charge on property within the area benefited and may provide for the collection of said charge as set forth in this title. The city may enter into reimbursement agreements with a subdivider who constructs said facilities, bridges or thoroughfares, and the charges collected by the city therefor may be utilized to reimburse the subdivider as set forth in this chapter.

B. Purpose and Intent. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the vesting tentative map statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the subdivision ordinance. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the subdivision ordinance shall apply to the vesting tentative map ordinance.

C. Consistency. No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by the zoning ordinance or other applicable provisions of the municipal code.

1. This chapter shall apply to residential, commercial, and industrial developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by the city subdivision ordinance, requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential, commercial, or industrial development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof.

2. If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. (Ord. 90-552 § 2).


16.57.020 Procedures.

A. Filing and Processing. A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the city subdivision ordinance for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:

The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by the subdivision ordinance for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map. (Ord. 90-552 § 2).


16.57.030 Development rights.

A. Vesting on Approval of Vesting Tentative Map.

1. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Section 66474.2 of the Government Code.

However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.

2. Notwithstanding subsection (A)(1) of this section, a permit approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:

a. A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both;

b. The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law.

3. The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in FMC 16.57.020(C). If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:

a. An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded;

b. The initial time period set forth in subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a committee application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds 30 days, from the date a complete application is filed;

c. A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection (A)(3)(a) of this section expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the city council within 15 days;

d. If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (A)(3)(a) through (c) of this section the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit.

B. Development Inconsistent with Zoning – Conditional Approval.

1. Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding subsection (A) of this section, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved.

2. The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in subsection (A)(3) of this section.

C. Applications Inconsistent with Current Policies. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described in this section, and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

G. Corner Lots – Sight Distance. In any residential district on a corner lot, there shall be no fence, wall, or hedge higher than three feet, nor any obstruction to vision other than a post, column, or tree not exceeding one foot in diameter between a height of three feet and a height of 10 feet above the established grade of either street, within an area 33 feet from the intersection of the street lot lines.

A. Purposes. The purposes of this section are to:

1. Minimize visual impacts of communications structures through careful site design, location, and vegetative screening;

2. Avoid potential damage to adjacent property from communications structure failure through engineering and careful placement of structures;

3. Maximize use of any existing or new communications structures so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and/or structures.

B. Definition. “Communication structure” means any structure, tower, and/or device that is intended for transmitting or receiving television, radio, or telephone communications.

C. Use Permit.

1. Commercial communications structures that exceed the height limits established in the zone districts and accessory uses associated with such structures may be permitted in the (M-1), (M-2), (RE), or (PF) zoning districts with a use permit.

2. Private communications structures less than 50 feet in height are permitted in any zone. Private communication structures 50 feet or greater in height are permitted in any zone with a use permit.

D. Approval Criteria. Communications structures may be allowed, based on findings by the planning commission that the following criteria are met:

1. Site Size and Setbacks. The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate setback from the base of any structure to any property lines or public streets. Such setback shall be sufficient to:

a. Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic, or other buffer;

b. Preserve the privacy of adjoining private and public property;

c. Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower failure. The applicant shall demonstrate that the site of communications structures shall contain all debris resulting from potential tower failure and demonstrate that adjoining properties shall be protected from falling debris.

2. Visual Impact. The applicant shall demonstrate that a communications structure can be expected to have the least visual impact on the environment, taking into consideration technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors. Factors to consider shall include:

a. Communications structures clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design, whenever possible.

b. Communications structures shall have a galvanized finish or be painted silver. If there is dense vegetation in the immediate area, such structures may be required to be painted green from the base to tree line, with the remainder painted silver or given a galvanized finish.

c. Communications structures shall be camouflaged using landscaping or making them blend into the surroundings by making them look like a tree or other manmade or natural feature in the area.

d. Communications structures shall be the minimum height necessary, based on an engineering analysis of the area of coverage.

e. Any communications structure must not unreasonably interfere with the view of or from any public park, natural scenic vista, or major view corridor.

f. All obsolete or unused facilities must be removed within 12 months of cessation of operations at a site.

3. Required Sharing of New Commercial Communications Structures.

a. All new communications structures shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum number of additional users technically practicable.

b. If a new communications structure is approved, the applicant shall be required as a condition of approval to:

i. Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information required by subsection (D)(4)(b) of this section from a potential shared-use applicant;

ii. Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties;

iii. Allow shared use where the third party seeking such use agrees in writing to pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges necessary to modify the structure and transmitters to accommodate shared use, but not total reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating structure or audio interference;

iv. Submit a letter of intent to lease excess space on the structure and to lease additional excess land on the site when the shared use potential of the communications structure is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible. The applicant shall describe what range of charges can reasonably be expected to be assessed against shared users. The applicant shall base charges on generally accepted accounting principles and shall explain the elements included in the charge, including, but not limited to, a pro rata share of the actual site selection and processing costs, land costs, site design, construction and maintenance costs, finance costs, return on equity, and depreciation. This information will remain confidential, unless an applicant fails to negotiate in good faith on shared use of a communications structure.

c. Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose communications structure was approved after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section to comply with the requirements of subsections (D)(3)(b)(i) through (iv) of this section shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the use permit.

Following report of such failure, a public hearing shall be scheduled with the planning commission to determine whether the use permit should be suspended or revoked.

4. Shared Use of Existing Commercial Communications Structures. The purpose of this section is to encourage the shared use of communications structures, in order to minimize the visual impact on the community. In reviewing applications for new structures, factors to be considered include how a structure will impact the privacy of adjoining private and public property, impact the view shed in the area, and affect the ability of an applicant to rent space on an existing structure.

The applicant shall make a good-faith effort to substantially demonstrate that a proposed structure cannot be located on the site of an existing or planned communications structure, as described below:

a. The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned communications structure sites approved containing sufficient area to accommodate the proposed structure and support elements. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date of such contact, and the form and content of such contact.

b. The applicant shall request the following information from each owner contacted:

i. Identification of the site by location, assessor’s parcel number, and existing uses;

ii. Whether each site could accommodate the communications structure proposed by the applicant without changing the existing or proposed structure. To enable the owner to respond, the applicant shall provide each owner with the dimensional characteristics of the proposed structure and other relevant data about the structure;

iii. Whether each such site could accommodate the structure proposed by the applicant if either or both the existing or proposed communications structure was structurally or otherwise changed. If changes due to structural or radio frequency (RF) interference would be required, the owner shall specify in general terms what those changes are;

iv. The fee an owner would charge for shared use if the existing structure can accommodate the communication device proposed by the applicant. Shared use is not precluded simply because a perceived unreasonable fee for shared use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the existing and proposed uses to a shared site. The planning commission may consider expert testimony to determine whether the fee and costs are reasonable.

E. Requirements for Application. The following information shall be submitted with the use permit application:

1. The information required by Chapter 17.07 FMC;

2. A report from a professional engineer licensed in the state of California that includes the following:

a. Structure height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A cross-section of the structure shall be included;

b. Total anticipated capacity of the structure and size of dishes, including number and types of antennas that can be accommodated;

c. Evidence of structural integrity of the structure as required by the building division;

d. Failure characteristics of the structure and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris;

3. Decision and Notice. Within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing, the zoning administrator or planning commission shall grant or deny the variance, use permit, planned development, or amendment applied for. The granting may be subject to terms and conditions attached thereto and made a part thereof.

The action shall be expressed in writing and shall contain findings of fact as to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the sections describing the variance, permit, and amendment requirements. Failure of the planning commission to act within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing shall be deemed to be a denial of the application on that date. Any decision shall become final 15 days from the date of rendering unless an appeal has been filed within that time.

D. Appeal Procedures.

1. Administrative Actions Appealable. Any person aggrieved by any determination, interpretation, decision, decree, judgment, or similar action taken by the zoning administrator under the provisions of the zoning ordinance may appeal such action to the planning commission.

Within a reasonable period of time following filing of the notice of appeal, the planning commission or the city council shall render its decision on the matter. Failure of the planning commission or the city council to render its decision on the matter within 60 days of the filing of the appeal shall be deemed to be a denial of the appeal.

6. Conclusiveness of the Decision. The decision of the city council upon an appeal is final and conclusive to all things involved in the matter.

E. Limitations and Extensions.

1. Zoning clearance certificates, use permits, variances, and planned developments are privileges assigned to the land, not the individuals owning the land.

2. If the applicant or property owner files an application with the community development department before the expiration of an unused use permit, for extension of the same, such request may be extended for up to one additional year. Only one extension may be granted for each unused use permit.

17.07.005 Grounds for revocation.

Zoning clearance certificates, use permits, planned developments, or variances may be revoked or modified by the planning commission after a public hearing on any one or more of the following grounds:

A. That the approval was obtained by fraud, material omissions, or misstatements of fact;

B. That the use for which such approval was granted has ceased to exist or has been suspended for one year or more;

C. That the permit granted is being, or recently has been, exercised contrary to the terms or conditions of such approval, or in violation of any statute, code section, law, or regulation;

D. That the use for which the approval was granted has been so exercised as to be detrimental to the public health or safety, or so as to constitute a nuisance. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.006 Expiration of certificates, permits, and variances.

A zoning clearance certificate, use permit, planned development, and variance shall expire one year after issuance, unless extended or otherwise indicated on the certificate, permit, or variance, or when the proposed development no longer conforms with this code, unless the proposed development has commenced, as authorized by any required certificate, license, or permit, and is being diligently pursued. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.007 Security.

A. Penalty Bond. To ensure the performance of conditions imposed at the time of granting or modification of a permit or variance, the applicant may be required to furnish security in the form of money or surety bond in an amount fixed by the zoning administrator sufficient to accomplish the completion of the conditions. Such money or bond shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit. Every bond to ensure performance of conditions shall be a penalty bond, shall be payable to the city of Fortuna, and shall be conditioned upon compliance with the conditions and limitations, including any limitation of time, upon which such permit or variance is granted. Upon the breach of any condition or limitation, including a limitation of time, upon which the permit or variance is granted, the money or the bond furnished as security shall be used to complete any work associated with the conditions. If there are any excess funds remaining after the work has been completed, such funds shall be paid into the general fund of the city to cover administrative expenses.

B. Consistency with Approved Project. Prior to issuance of a building permit for any development project, use permit, design review permit, planned development, or variance, final plans and improvements, where required, shall be approved by the zoning administrator or designee as being consistent with the decision on the project.

C. Final Inspection. The final plans and improvements shall be fully completed prior to final building inspection of the project; provided, that if the improvements have not been completed on such date, an extension of time for completion may be granted by the zoning administrator or his designee if implementation is secured by an agreement and the posting of adequate security. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.050 Zoning clearance certificates.

A. Purpose. A zoning clearance certificate shall be required for all principal permitted uses whenever a building permit is required, and must be secured prior to the issuance of the building permit. No public hearing is required prior to issuing a zoning clearance certificate for a principal permitted use.

2. The proposed development complies with the terms and conditions of any applicable permit and/or subdivision map that was previously approved for such development; and

3. The proposed development is not located on the same lot where conditions exist or activities are being conducted that are in violation of this code, unless the development permit is necessary for the abatement of the existing violation. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.060 Use permits.

A. Purpose. These provisions establish the procedures, in addition to those specified in FMC 17.07.003 and 17.07.004, for accommodating conditional uses with special site or design requirements, operating characteristics, or for projects that may have the potential to cause adverse effects on surrounding properties. The procedures in this section shall apply to all proposals for which a conditional use permit is required.

The planning commission may hear and decide applications for use permits where the use is not specifically enumerated in this title, and it is, in the opinion of the commission, similar to and compatible with the uses permitted in that zone where the proposed use is to be sited.

1. That the proposed use at the size and intensity contemplated, and at the proposed location, will provide a development that is necessary or desirable for, and compatible with, the neighborhood or the community; and

2. That such use as proposed will not be detrimental to the health, safety, convenience, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to the property, improvements, or potential development in the vicinity with respect to aspects including, but not limited to, the following:

a. The nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape, and the proposed size, shape, and arrangement of structures;

b. The accessibility and traffic patterns for persons and vehicles, the type and volume of such traffic, and the adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading;

c. The safeguards afforded to prevent noxious or offensive emissions such as noise, glare, dust, and odor;

d. Treatment given, as appropriate, to such aspects as landscaping, screening, open spaces, parking areas, loading areas, service areas, lighting, and signs; and

D. The planning commission may set time limits regarding the length of any use permit. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.070 Variances.

A. Purpose. This section establishes the procedures, in addition to those specified in FMC 17.07.003 and FMC 17.07.004, for permitting variations from the strict application of the provisions of this title, by reason of exceptional circumstances and other specified conditions.

1. That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances applying to the property involved or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other property or uses in the same class or district;

2. That owing to such exceptional or extraordinary circumstances, the literal enforcement of specified provisions of this title would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship not created by or attributable to the applicant or the owner of the property; and

3. That such variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with limitations imposed on similarly zoned properties. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).


17.07.080 Planned developments.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish procedures in addition to those in FMC 17.07.003 and FMC 17.07.004 and to provide flexible alternative standards for land development that result in innovative and creative design, as well as economy in development. Development projects approved under this section shall be functionally equivalent to or better than projects developed subject to the requirements of the zoning district.

Central to the purpose of a planned development is the concept of group or clustering buildings that result in smaller private open spaces, consolidated common open space, and less-costly improvements.

This section may be used to accommodate projects on sites with unusual geography, topography, size, or shape. Planned developments may have several parcel owners who have common interests in land other than the parcel to which they alone have fee title.

B. Regulations.

1. Permitted Uses. A planned development shall be permitted in all zones, if approved pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Approved planned developments shall include only those uses permitted either as permitted uses, accessory uses, or conditional uses in the zoning district in which the planned development is located.

2. Waiver of Development Standards. Exceptions to the frontage, lot area, lot width, lot depth, ground coverage, yard size, parking, and loading requirements of the zoning district, and exceptions to the improvement standards and specifications may be granted in accordance with subsection (C) of this section.

3. Density Limitations. The density limitations of the zoning district may not be waived. Density limitations shall be established based on a tentative map designed to meet normal zoning standards. Property not considered developable under normal zoning standards shall not be counted toward the permitted density in a planned development.

4. Open Space. Any planned development containing dwellings shall include common open space. This requirement shall be discretionary for developments containing single detached dwellings. The regulations in FMC 17.03.012(G) shall apply to planned developments. At least 40 percent of any planned development shall be in open space as defined in FMC 17.05.141, and such percentage may be increased by the city council or planning commission. The minimum amount of open space required may not be waived.

5. Design Review. Planned developments are subject to design review in accordance with this chapter.

6. Management and Maintenance of Open Space and Improvements. The city may require that a homeowners’ association be established to provide management, maintenance, and preservation of lots and areas owned in common. The shares or certificates of membership shall also only be transferable by the separately owned lots in the planned development.

C. Criteria for Granting. A planned development may be approved or approved with conditions by the authorized hearing official or body, if, based upon information provided by the applicant, all of the following findings are made:

1. That the public interest would be best served by allowing a planned development, rather than a project constructed in accordance with the requirements of the zoning district; and

2. That the planned development is functionally equivalent or better in design than would be a project constructed under the requirements of the zoning district; and

3. That the planned development at the size and intensity contemplated, and at the proposed location, will provide a development that is necessary or desirable for, and compatible with, the neighborhood or the community; and

4. That the planned development will not be detrimental to the health, safety, convenience, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, or injurious to the property, improvements, or potential development in the vicinity with respect to aspects including, but not limited to, the following:

a. The nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape, and the proposed size, shape, and arrangement of structures;

b. The accessibility and traffic patterns for persons and vehicles, the type and volume of such traffic, and the adequacy of proposed off-street parking and loading;

c. The safeguards afforded to prevent noxious or offensive emissions such as noise, glare, dust, and odor;

d. Treatment given, as appropriate, to such aspects as landscaping, screening, open spaces, parking and loading areas, service areas, lighting, and signs; and

5. That such use or feature as proposed will be consistent with the policies and standards of the Fortuna general plan. (Ord. 2011-692 § 2 (Exh. A)).
